## Amplitude Platform

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools for product analytics, feature experimentation, customer data management, and user engagement optimization. The platform consists of multiple integrated products designed to support the complete product development lifecycle from instrumentation to analysis to optimization.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem is organized around several core product areas:

**Analytics Core** - The foundational analytics platform featuring multiple chart types and analysis methods:

- **Retention Analysis** - User retention and churn analysis
- **Cohort Analysis** (Lifecycle) - User lifecycle and engagement patterns
- **User Journey Analysis** (Journeys) - Path analysis and user flow mapping
- **Revenue Analysis** (Revenue LTV) - Monetization and lifetime value tracking
- **Engagement Analysis** (Stickiness, Engagement Matrix) - User engagement depth and frequency
- **Advanced Analytics** (Personas, Compass, Impact Analysis) - Behavioral segmentation and predictive analytics

**Amplitude Experiment** - Feature flagging and A/B testing platform with:
- **Experiment Management** - A/B test creation, configuration, and analysis
- **Feature Flags** - Feature toggle management and gradual rollouts
- **Advanced Techniques** - Statistical methods and experiment design
- **Experiment Theory** - Best practices and methodological guidance
- **Results Analysis** - Dedicated experiment results visualization

**Data Management (CDP)** - Customer data platform capabilities including:
- **Sources** - Data ingestion from various platforms and tools
- **Destinations** - Data activation and export to downstream systems
- **Audiences** - User segmentation and audience management
- **Data Governance** - PII management and data quality controls
- **Warehouse-native** - Direct data warehouse integration

**Additional Products:**
- **Session Replay** - User session recording and analysis
- **Guides and Surveys** - In-product messaging and user feedback collection

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Analytics Concepts:**
- **Events** - User actions tracked within applications (clicks, views, purchases)
- **Properties** - Attributes associated with events and users for segmentation
- **Cohorts** - User groups defined by shared characteristics or behaviors
- **Segments** - Filtered subsets of users or events for analysis
- **Funnels** - Sequential steps in user workflows with conversion tracking
- **Retention** - User return behavior measured over time periods

**Experimentation Terms:**
- **Variants** - Different versions of features being tested
- **Bucketing** - User assignment to experiment groups
- **Holdouts** - Control groups excluded from experiments
- **Mutex Groups** - Mutually exclusive experiment groups
- **Deployments** - Environment configurations for experiment delivery

**Data Management:**
- **Sources** - Systems that send data to Amplitude
- **Destinations** - Systems that receive data from Amplitude
- **Transformations** - Data processing and enrichment rules
- **Schemas** - Data structure definitions and validation rules

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The platform operates as an integrated ecosystem where:

**SDKs and Instrumentation** provide the foundation with support for:
- Client-side SDKs (Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal)
