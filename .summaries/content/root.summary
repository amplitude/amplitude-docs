## High-Level Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics platform that helps businesses understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform enables companies to collect, analyze, and activate user data across digital touchpoints to make informed product decisions.

Key features include behavioral analytics, user segmentation, funnel analysis, retention tracking, experimentation capabilities, and data integration with various marketing and operational tools. Amplitude serves product teams, marketers, data analysts, and developers by providing actionable insights about how users interact with digital products.

## Product Relationships and Features

The Amplitude platform consists of several interconnected components:

1. **Analytics Core**
   - **Event Segmentation**: Analyze user behavior by breaking down events by properties
   - **Funnel Analysis**: Track conversion rates through multi-step user flows
   - **Retention Analysis**: Measure how users return to your product over time
   - **Pathfinder**: Visualize common user journeys through your product
   - **User Sessions**: Analyze engagement patterns within user sessions
   - **Impact Analysis**: Measure how feature changes affect key metrics
   - **Lifecycle**: Track new, returning, and dormant users

2. **Data Management**
   - **SDK Catalog**: Cross-platform SDKs for web, mobile, and server-side implementations
   - **Ampli**: Type-safe analytics implementation based on tracking plans
   - **Data Sources**: Integrations with third-party platforms and data warehouses
   - **User Identity Resolution**: Track users across devices and sessions

3. **Experimentation**
   - **Experiment**: Feature flagging and A/B testing with statistical analysis
   - **Web Experiment**: Visual A/B testing for non-technical users
   - **Experiment Results**: Statistical analysis of experiment outcomes

4. **Audience Management**
   - **Audiences**: Create and manage user segments based on behavior
   - **Personas**: Machine learning-based user segmentation
   - **Destination Catalog**: Activate insights in external marketing platforms

5. **Engagement Tools**
   - **Guides and Surveys**: In-app messaging and feedback collection
   - **Session Replay**: Visual recording of user interactions

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: A discrete user action tracked in Amplitude (e.g., page view, button click)
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes associated with users across sessions
- **Event Properties**: Contextual information about specific events
- **Cohort**: A group of users who share common characteristics or behaviors
- **Session**: A period of continuous user activity, defined by timeout thresholds
- **MTU (Monthly Tracked Users)**: Unique users triggering events within a calendar month
- **Device ID**: Unique identifier for a device or browser
- **User ID**: Custom identifier for a logged-in user
- **Amplitude ID**: System-generated identifier managing the relationship between Device IDs and User IDs
- **Tracking Plan**: Schema defining expected events and properties
- **Feature Flag**: Toggle controlling feature visibility in experiments
- **Variant**: Specific version of a feature being tested
- **Exposure Event**: Tracks when a user encounters an experiment variant
- **Statistical Significance**: Confidence that observed differences aren't due to chance

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates with the broader digital product stack through:

1. **Data Collection Layer**: Events flow into Amplitude through SDKs, APIs, or integrations
2. **Analysis Layer**: Data is processed and made available through charts and visualizations
3. **Activation Layer**: Insights are exported to marketing, engagement, and operational tools

The platform connects with:
- **Data Sources**: Import from Segment, Rudderstack, Mixpanel, and custom sources
- **Data Warehouses**: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift for data storage and analysis
- **Marketing Platforms**: Facebook, Google Ads, Braze, Iterable for audience activation
- **Development Tools**: GitHub, Jira, Slack for workflow integration
- **Customer Data Platforms**: mParticle, Segment, Tealium for unified data management

## API Endpoints and Implementation

### Key API Endpoints
- **HTTP API V2**: `/2/httpapi` for sending events
- **Identify API**: `/identify` for updating user properties
- **Batch API**: For sending multiple events in a single request
- **Export API**: For retrieving raw event data
- **Experiment Evaluation API**: For retrieving experiment variants

### SDK Implementation Examples
```javascript
// Browser SDK example
import * as amplitude from '@amplitude/analytics-browser';

amplitude.init('API_KEY', {
  defaultTracking: {
    sessions: true,
    pageViews: true
  }
});

amplitude.track('Button Clicked', {
  buttonColor: 'blue',
  buttonText: 'Submit'
});
```

### Ampli Implementation
```javascript
// Initialize Ampli
ampli.load({
  client: {
    apiKey: 'API_KEY'
  }
});

// Track strongly-typed event
ampli.trackEvent('ProductPurchased', {
  productId: '123',
  price: 99.99,
  quantity: 1
});
```

The platform offers tiered plans (Starter, Growth, Enterprise) with varying features, data volume limits, and support options, designed to scale from startups to enterprise organizations.
