Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products working together to deliver end-to-end analytics, experimentation, and customer data management capabilities.

## Core Product Architecture

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, providing behavioral analytics, user journey tracking, and comprehensive reporting through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Cohort Analysis (Lifecycle), Revenue LTV, Stickiness, Journeys, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, and Experiment Results. The analytics platform supports real-time data processing and offers both current and legacy chart implementations.

**Amplitude Experiment** is the feature flagging and A/B testing platform that enables teams to run controlled experiments, manage feature rollouts, and optimize user experiences. It includes advanced techniques for statistical analysis, experiment theory foundations, workflow management, and comprehensive troubleshooting capabilities. The platform provides "under the hood" technical insights for advanced users and integrates deeply with the analytics layer for results analysis.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user sessions to provide visual insights into user behavior, enabling teams to understand user interactions, identify friction points, and optimize user experiences through recorded session analysis.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** delivers in-product user engagement through contextual messaging, onboarding flows, feedback collection, and user guidance systems, serving as an alternative to traditional popup-based engagement tools.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and distribution across the ecosystem, including audience management, source and destination catalogs, warehouse-native capabilities, and PII handling integrations.

## SDK and Integration Ecosystem

The platform provides comprehensive SDK coverage across multiple programming languages and platforms:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser (JavaScript), Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine implementations, each following platform-specific best practices and integration patterns.

**Experiment SDKs** offer dedicated experimentation capabilities across the same platform coverage, enabling feature flag evaluation and experiment participation tracking.

**Ampli** serves as a type-safe wrapper and code generation tool that creates strongly-typed analytics implementations, ensuring data quality and reducing implementation errors across development teams.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Concepts

**Events and Properties** form the core data model, where events represent user actions and properties provide contextual information. The platform distinguishes between user properties (persistent attributes) and event properties (action-specific data).

**Cohorts and Audiences** enable user segmentation based on behavioral patterns, demographic information, or custom criteria, supporting both real-time and batch audience creation for targeting and analysis.

**Funnels and Journeys** track multi-step user flows, conversion optimization, and path analysis, providing insights into user progression through defined sequences of actions.

**Retention and Lifecycle** analysis tracks user engagement patterns over time, measuring how users return to and engage with products across different time periods.

**Feature Flags and Experiments** control feature availability and enable controlled testing, with support for percentage rollouts, user targeting, and statistical significance testing.

## API Architecture and Endpoints

The platform exposes comprehensive REST APIs across product lines:

**Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/*`) provides programmatic access to event ingestion, user data management, and query execution capabilities.

**Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/*`) enable feature flag management, experiment configuration, and results retrieval through RESTful endpoints.

**Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/*`) supports in-product messaging management and response data access.

Common API patterns include authentication via API keys, rate limiting, batch operations for high-volume data ingestion, and webhook support for real-time data streaming.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** provides organizational structure, user permissions, project management, and cross-team collaboration tools with role-based access control.

**Single Sign-On (SSO)** integration supports enterprise authentication systems including SAML, OAuth, and directory services for centralized user management.

**Billing and Usage** monitoring tracks platform consumption, provides usage analytics, and manages subscription limits across different product tiers.

**Data Governance** includes PII handling, data retention policies, privacy controls, and compliance features for regulated industries.

## Migration and Onboarding

The platform provides comprehensive migration tools and documentation for transitioning from other analytics platforms, including data mapping guides, SDK migration paths, and best practices for maintaining data continuity during platform transitions.

**Get Started** workflows guide new users through initial setup, SDK implementation, event planning, and basic analysis creation, with progressive disclosure of advanced features as teams mature in their analytics sophistication.

## Multi-Language and Localization Support

The platform supports internationalization through Japanese translations and multi-site content management, enabling global organizations to deploy analytics and experimentation capabilities across different regions and languages while maintaining consistent data collection and analysis standards.

## Partner and Integration Ecosystem

Extensive **Partner** integrations connect Amplitude with the broader marketing technology and data infrastructure ecosystem, including data warehouses, customer engagement platforms, business intelligence tools, and marketing automation systems through both pre-built connectors and custom integration capabilities.

The **Source and Destination Catalogs** provide pre-configured integrations with popular tools and platforms, enabling rapid data pipeline setup and reducing implementation complexity for common integration scenarios.

## Educational and Support Resources

**Academy Content** provides structured learning paths, best practices documentation, and advanced technique guides for maximizing platform value across different user roles and experience levels.

**FAQ and Troubleshooting** resources offer comprehensive problem-solving guidance, common issue resolution, and technical support documentation across all product areas.

The platform's documentation architecture supports both getting started quickly with basic implementations and scaling to enterprise-level deployments with advanced configuration, custom integrations, and sophisticated analysis workflows.
