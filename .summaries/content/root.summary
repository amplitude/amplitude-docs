Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven decision making. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics for behavioral tracking, Experiment for A/B testing and feature flagging, Session Replay for user experience analysis, and Guides and Surveys for in-product engagement.

## Core Product Architecture and Relationships

The platform operates on a hierarchical organizational structure where **Organizations** contain multiple **Projects**, each representing distinct data collection environments with independent API keys, user permissions, and configuration settings. The **Portfolio** feature enables Enterprise customers to perform cross-project analysis by merging up to 5-10 projects using user ID/device ID matching.

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational data layer, capturing user interactions as events with associated properties through multiple ingestion methods including SDKs (Android, iOS, JavaScript), server-side APIs (HTTP V2, Batch API, Identify API), and third-party integrations. The analytics engine supports both individual user and group-level analysis through the Accounts add-on for B2B use cases.

**Amplitude Experiment** integrates deeply with Analytics to provide enterprise-scale A/B testing and feature flagging capabilities. It operates through two evaluation modes: Local Evaluation for performance-optimized client-side assignment using Device ID, and Remote Evaluation for full-featured targeting using Amplitude ID. The platform includes advanced traffic management through sticky bucketing, mutual exclusion groups, and holdout groups.

**Session Replay** captures and reconstructs user interactions across web, mobile, and React Native applications through multiple integration patterns: native Amplitude plugins, middleware implementations, standalone SDKs, and third-party analytics integrations (Segment, Google Tag Manager, Rudderstack).

**Guides and Surveys** provides in-product user experience capabilities through interactive guidance and feedback collection, deploying via dedicated SDKs and integrating with the broader analytics ecosystem for targeting and measurement.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events and Properties**: Events represent user actions (e.g., "Button Clicked," "Page Viewed"), while properties provide context through event-level attributes ("Button Color") or user-level attributes ("Subscription Plan"). The platform distinguishes between these for different analytical purposes.

**Cohorts**: Behavioral cohorts are dynamic user segments based on actions and properties within specific time periods, while static cohorts are fixed user lists typically imported via CSV. The system supports complex definitions with temporal parameters including "during," "since," and "within" clauses.

**Bucketing and Variant Assignment**: Experiment participants are assigned to variants using deterministic hashing algorithms with bucketing keys (Device ID for local evaluation, Amplitude ID for remote evaluation) to ensure consistent user experiences.

**Session Management**: Sessions group related user activities within time windows, supporting marketing analytics through channel classifiers and attribution models. Session Replay synchronizes session identifiers across analytics providers for data correlation.

**Groups and Accounts**: The Accounts add-on introduces group-level analytics where events can be associated with organizational units. Group types (limited to 5 per project) define categories like "Company," while group values represent specific instances.

**Privacy and Masking**: Session Replay implements three-tier privacy systems (Conservative, Light, Medium) with CSS selector masking, custom element protection, and UGC filter rules for compliance with data protection regulations.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The platform integrates extensively with external systems through multiple APIs and interfaces:

**Core APIs**:
- **HTTP V2 API** (`api2.amplitude.com`) for event ingestion
- **Identify API** for user property updates and group associations
- **Group Identify API** for account-level property management
- **Dashboard REST API** for programmatic chart and dashboard management
- **User Management API** for SCIM 2.0 provisioning
- **Experiment Evaluation APIs** (`api.lab.amplitude.com`) for variant assignment

**Analytics Chart Types**: The platform offers comprehensive visualization through Event Segmentation for measuring user engagement, Funnel Analysis for conversion tracking, Retention Analysis for user stickiness, User Sessions for session-based metrics, and specialized charts like Pathfinder for user journey analysis, Compass for metric correlation, and various cohort analysis tools.

**Collaboration and Content Management**: Features include Spaces for organizing content, Dashboards for executive reporting, Notebooks for analytical storytelling, and extensive sharing capabilities through public links, embed codes, and integrations with Slack, Miro, and Atlassian products.

**Advanced Analytics Capabilities**: AI-powered features include Ask Amplitude for natural language querying, Anomaly + Forecast using Prophet algorithms, Root Cause Analysis for investigating data anomalies, and automated Insights for metric change alerting.

## Technical Implementation and Configuration

**SDK Integration Patterns**: The platform supports multiple implementation approaches including native SDK integration, plugin architectures for modular functionality, middleware implementations for legacy systems, and standalone SDKs for third-party analytics environments.

**Data Management**: Features include Scale (dynamic behavioral sampling), Self-Service Data Deletion for GDPR/CCPA compliance, and sophisticated user permission systems with role-based access control (Viewer, Member, Manager, Admin) and Enterprise Permission Groups.

**Experimentation Infrastructure**: Advanced capabilities include Bonferroni correction for multiple hypothesis testing, Sample Ratio Mismatch detection for data quality assurance, outlier detection and mitigation strategies, and comprehensive statistical analysis frameworks.

**Privacy and Compliance**: Robust privacy controls include consent management integration, PII masking and anonymization, form field content protection, and configurable data residency options (US/EU server zones).

The Amplitude platform represents a comprehensive product intelligence ecosystem that scales from individual user tracking to enterprise-wide analytics programs, with sophisticated experimentation capabilities, extensive integration options, and advanced collaboration features designed for modern product development workflows.
