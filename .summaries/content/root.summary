Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools for product analytics, feature experimentation, customer data management, and user engagement optimization. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products designed to help teams understand user behavior, test product changes, and drive data-informed decision making.

## Core Product Suite

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics platform, offering advanced behavioral analytics through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Revenue LTV, and Experiment Results. These charts enable deep analysis of user behavior patterns, conversion optimization, and business performance measurement.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced statistical analysis, supporting both client-side and server-side experimentation. The platform includes experiment theory documentation, advanced techniques, workflow management, troubleshooting guides, and comprehensive result analysis tools integrated directly into the analytics interface.

**Amplitude Data** functions as a customer data platform (CDP) offering data governance, schema management, audience creation, source/destination catalogs, and warehouse-native capabilities. This includes comprehensive data pipeline management with real-time streaming to marketing and sales tools.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user session recordings to provide qualitative insights complementing quantitative analytics data.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user engagement through targeted messaging, onboarding flows, and feedback collection mechanisms.

## Technical Implementation and SDKs

The platform provides extensive SDK coverage across multiple programming languages and frameworks:

**Client-Side SDKs**: Browser JavaScript, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Unity, and Unreal Engine SDKs enable comprehensive client-side event tracking with features like automatic session management, offline event queuing, and real-time data transmission.

**Server-Side SDKs**: Node.js, Python, Java, and Go SDKs support backend event tracking, user property management, and server-side experiment evaluation with batch processing capabilities and enterprise-grade reliability.

**Ampli Code Generation**: The Ampli toolkit generates type-safe, auto-generated tracking libraries from centralized tracking plans, providing compile-time validation, IDE autocompletion, and runtime verification to ensure data quality and implementation consistency.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events and Properties**
- **Events**: Discrete user actions or system occurrences (e.g., "Purchase Completed", "Page Viewed")
- **Event Properties**: Contextual attributes specific to individual events (e.g., purchase_amount, page_url)
- **User Properties**: Persistent user attributes that evolve over time (e.g., subscription_tier, device_type)
- **Group Properties**: Organization or account-level attributes when using Accounts functionality

**Experimentation Terminology**
- **Feature Flags**: Boolean toggles controlling feature visibility and behavior
- **Variants**: Different versions of features being tested in experiments
- **Allocation**: Percentage of users exposed to experiments
- **Statistical Significance**: Confidence level in experiment results (typically 95%)

**Data Management**
- **Tracking Plans**: Centralized schemas defining event taxonomy and validation rules
- **Sources**: Data input configurations (SDKs, third-party integrations)
- **Destinations**: External platforms receiving Amplitude data via streaming
- **Transformations**: Query-time data modifications without affecting raw data
- **Cohorts**: User segments based on behavioral or demographic criteria

**Chart-Specific Concepts**
- **Funnels**: Sequential step analysis measuring conversion rates
- **Retention**: User return behavior over specified time periods
- **Stickiness**: Frequency of user engagement within time windows
- **Lifecycle**: User state transitions (New, Current, Resurrected, Dormant)
- **Journeys**: Path analysis showing user navigation patterns

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude operates as a comprehensive analytics ecosystem with deep integrations across the product suite. **Analytics** serves as the central hub, with **Experiment** results automatically flowing into analytics charts for unified analysis. **Data** provides the foundational layer with tracking plans, schema validation, and data quality monitoring supporting both Analytics and Experiment implementations.

**Customer Data Platform** capabilities include real-time audience synchronization to advertising platforms (Facebook, Google Ads), marketing automation tools (Braze, Iterable), and data warehouses (Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery). The platform supports both one-time and continuous cohort syncing with sub-60-second latency for real-time use cases.

**Enterprise Features** include Single Sign-On (SSO) integration, advanced user permissions, PII data classification and access controls, custom data retention policies, and comprehensive audit logging for compliance requirements.
