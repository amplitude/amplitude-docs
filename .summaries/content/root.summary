Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides product teams with tools for user behavior analysis, feature experimentation, data management, and user engagement. The platform consists of several interconnected products designed to help organizations understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven decision making.

## Core Product Architecture

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, offering multiple chart types for behavioral analysis including Event Segmentation for user action analysis, Funnel Analysis for conversion tracking, Retention Analysis for user stickiness measurement, User Sessions for engagement patterns, Cohort analysis through Lifecycle charts, Personas for user clustering, Journeys for path analysis, Stickiness for frequency measurement, Revenue LTV for monetization tracking, Impact Analysis for feature assessment, Engagement Matrix for user state visualization, Data Tables for raw data exploration, and Compass for metric monitoring.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced statistical methods, supporting experiment design, variant management, statistical analysis, and results interpretation. The platform includes experiment theory documentation, advanced techniques for complex testing scenarios, workflow management for experiment lifecycle, and troubleshooting resources.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and reconstructs user sessions for qualitative analysis, enabling teams to observe actual user interactions and identify friction points in the user experience.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** delivers in-product user engagement through contextual guides, feedback collection surveys, and resource centers, supporting user onboarding, feature adoption, and continuous feedback loops.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation through Sources for data collection, Destinations for data distribution, Audiences for user segmentation, and warehouse-native capabilities for direct data warehouse integration.

## SDK and API Ecosystem

The platform provides comprehensive instrumentation through multiple SDKs supporting various development environments:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser SDK (`/sdks/analytics/browser/`), Android SDK (`/sdks/analytics/android/`), iOS SDK (`/sdks/analytics/ios/`), React Native SDK (`/sdks/analytics/react-native/`), Flutter SDK (`/sdks/analytics/flutter/`), Node.js SDK (`/sdks/analytics/node/`), Python SDK (`/sdks/analytics-sdks/python/`), Java SDK (`/sdks/analytics/java/`), Go SDK (`/sdks/analytics/go/`), Unity SDK (`/sdks/analytics/unity/`), and Unreal SDK (`/sdks/analytics/unreal/`).

**Experiment SDKs** (`/sdks/experiment-sdks/`) provide feature flag evaluation and experiment participation across platforms, while **Ampli** (`/sdks/ampli/`) offers type-safe analytics implementation with code generation for consistent event tracking.

**API Infrastructure** includes Analytics API (`/apis/analytics/`) for data querying and export, Experiment APIs (`/apis/experiment/`) for flag management and evaluation, and Guides and Surveys API (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) for content management and delivery.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** represent user actions or system occurrences tracked within applications, forming the foundation of all analytics. **Properties** are key-value pairs that provide context about events, users, or groups. **Cohorts** define user segments based on behavioral criteria or properties. **Funnels** track sequential user actions to measure conversion rates. **Retention** measures user return behavior over time periods.

**Feature Flags** control feature visibility and behavior, while **Experiments** compare different user experiences through controlled testing. **Variants** represent different versions of features being tested. **Allocation** determines what percentage of users see each variant.

**Sources** are systems that send data to Amplitude, while **Destinations** receive data from Amplitude. **Transformations** modify data as it flows through the platform. **Schemas** define the structure and validation rules for incoming data.

**Guides** are interactive user onboarding experiences, **Surveys** collect user feedback, and **Resource Centers** provide self-service help content. **Form Factors** define how guides appear (modal, popover, tooltip, banner, pin, checklist).

## Integration and Data Management

The platform supports extensive integrations through **Source Catalog** (`/data/source-catalog/`) and **Destination Catalog** (`/data/destination-catalog/`) with taxonomy-based categorization. **PII Integrations** (`/data/pii/`) handle personally identifiable information with appropriate privacy controls.

**Warehouse-native Amplitude** (`/data/warehouse-native/`) enables direct analysis of data stored in cloud data warehouses without data movement. The CDP provides real-time data processing, transformation capabilities, and audience activation across marketing and product tools.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** (`/admin/account-management/`) handles user provisioning, permissions, and organizational settings. **Single Sign-on** (`/admin/single-sign-on/`) provides enterprise authentication integration. **Billing and Use** (`/admin/billing-use/`) tracks usage metrics and manages subscription limits.

The platform includes **Agents** (`/docs/agents/`) for automated data processing and **Partners** (`/partners/`) ecosystem for extended functionality. **Migration** (`/migration/`) resources support transitions from other analytics platforms.

## User Experience and Support

**Get Started** (`/get-started/`) provides onboarding resources and quick setup guides. **FAQ and Troubleshooting** (`/faq/`) addresses common implementation and usage questions. **Academy Content** offers educational materials for platform mastery.

The platform supports internationalization with **Japanese Translation** (`/jp/`) and multi-site content management. **Legacy Charts** maintain backward compatibility for deprecated visualization types.

**Preview Targets** across all collections enable content review before publication, while **Date Behavior** controls content visibility based on publication timing. The routing structure uses consistent URL patterns like `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/{slug}` for analytics features and `/sdks/{product}/{platform}/{slug}` for SDK documentation.

The platform's architecture emphasizes modularity and integration, allowing organizations to adopt individual components or implement the complete suite for comprehensive product analytics and optimization capabilities.
