Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides a full-stack solution for product teams, developers, and data analysts. The platform consists of four core products: Analytics for behavioral insights and user tracking, Experiment for feature flagging and A/B testing, Session Replay for visual user interaction analysis, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP) for data management and routing.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

**Amplitude Analytics** forms the foundation of the ecosystem, offering sophisticated behavioral analysis through multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Journeys, Compass, Data Tables, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, and Revenue LTV. The analytics engine processes events tracked through comprehensive SDK implementations across web, mobile, and server-side platforms.

**Amplitude Experiment** integrates deeply with Analytics to provide feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities. It operates through both remote evaluation (server-computed variants) and local evaluation (client-side flag processing) models, supporting sophisticated targeting including cohort-based segmentation derived from Analytics data. Experiment automatically tracks exposure events back to Analytics for comprehensive analysis.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and reconstructs user interactions through session recordings and heatmaps, providing visual context to complement Analytics behavioral data. It implements configurable privacy controls with three masking levels (Conservative, Light, Medium) and CSS selector-based overrides.

**Customer Data Platform** manages the data lifecycle through source and destination catalogs, audience management, and warehouse-native capabilities, serving as the data backbone for all other products.

**Ampli** functions as a code generation framework that creates strongly-typed APIs from tracking plans, ensuring implementation consistency and reducing instrumentation errors across development teams.

## SDK Ecosystem and Technical Implementation

The platform provides extensive SDK coverage across multiple programming languages and platforms:

**Analytics SDKs** support Browser (JavaScript/TypeScript), Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine with both current and legacy implementations.

**Experiment SDKs** offer client-side and server-side implementations across JavaScript, React Native, Android, iOS, Node.js, JVM (Java/Kotlin), Python, Ruby, PHP, and Go.

**Session Replay SDKs** provide native implementations for Browser, Android, iOS, and React Native with plugin architectures for existing Analytics integrations and standalone options for third-party analytics providers.

## Core Nomenclature and Technical Concepts

**Identity Management**: The platform uses Device ID, User ID, and Session ID as primary identifiers for cross-platform user tracking and analytics correlation. Group analytics enables B2B account-level analysis.

**Event Tracking**: Events represent user actions with associated properties, tracked through `track()` methods across all SDKs. The system supports revenue tracking, user properties via `identify()` calls, and automatic event enrichment.

**Evaluation Models**: Remote evaluation fetches pre-computed flag variants from Amplitude servers, while local evaluation downloads flag configurations for client-side processing, improving performance and enabling offline functionality.

**Data Residency**: ServerZone configuration supports US and EU data residency requirements for GDPR compliance across all products.

**Autocapture**: Automatic tracking of user interactions including page views, form submissions, file downloads, and element interactions without manual instrumentation.

**Cohort Targeting**: Advanced user segmentation enabling feature flags and experiments to target specific behavioral cohorts defined in Analytics.

## API Endpoints and Integration Interfaces

**Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/`) provides programmatic access to event data, user properties, and chart results. The HTTP V2 endpoints support modern event ingestion with batch processing capabilities.

**Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) enable flag management, variant assignment, and exposure tracking through both REST and streaming interfaces.

**Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) supports programmatic management of in-app messaging and user feedback collection.

**CLI Tools**: The Amplitude CLI facilitates Ampli workflows with commands including:
- `ampli pull` for downloading tracking plans
- `ampli status` for implementation verification
- `ampli codegen` for generating type-safe tracking libraries

**Integration Middleware**: Pre-built connectors for Segment, Rudderstack, and Google Tag Manager enable integration with existing analytics stacks while preserving Amplitude's advanced analytical capabilities.

## Enterprise and Administrative Features

**Account Management** (`/admin/account-management/`) encompasses organizational settings, user permissions, project configuration, and team collaboration tools.

**Single Sign-On** (`/admin/single-sign-on/`) provides enterprise authentication integration with SAML and OAuth providers for secure access management.

**Billing and Usage** (`/admin/billing-use/`) includes quota management, usage monitoring, cost optimization tools, and billing administration.

**Data Governance**: Comprehensive privacy controls including PII integrations, data deletion APIs for DSAR compliance, and granular data access permissions ensure adherence to data protection regulations.

## Advanced Analytics and Experimentation Capabilities

**Statistical Analysis**: The platform provides sophisticated experimentation methodologies including sample size calculations, statistical significance testing, and causal inference tools.

**Experiment Design**: Advanced techniques cover bucketing algorithms, assignment mechanisms, and data processing pipelines for reliable A/B testing.

**Chart Analysis**: Multiple visualization types support different analytical use cases, from basic event tracking to complex behavioral flow analysis and revenue attribution.

## Broader Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates with the broader product development ecosystem through partner integrations, data warehouse connections, and third-party analytics provider compatibility. The platform supports multi-site deployment with English and Japanese localization, comprehensive troubleshooting documentation, and migration guides for platform transitions.

The documentation structure reflects an enterprise-grade analytics platform designed for technical implementation teams requiring sophisticated user behavior analysis, product managers conducting data-driven decision making, and data analysts performing advanced behavioral research and experimentation.
