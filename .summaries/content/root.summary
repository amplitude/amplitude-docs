Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, run experiments, and make data-driven product decisions. The platform consists of several interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Core Product Architecture

The platform is built around a multi-product ecosystem with shared infrastructure and data models. The primary products include:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, providing event tracking, user behavior analysis, and comprehensive charting capabilities. It supports multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Compass, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Revenue LTV, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Data Tables, and Experiment Results.

**Amplitude Experiment** is the behavioral experimentation platform enabling A/B testing and feature flag management through workflow-driven approaches. It utilizes sequential testing methodology and supports both client-side and server-side deployments with local and remote evaluation modes.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user session recordings for qualitative insights into user behavior and experience optimization.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** provides in-product messaging and user feedback collection capabilities for user engagement and research.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation across the ecosystem, including source and destination catalogs, audience management, and warehouse-native capabilities.

## Product Relationships and Integration

The products operate as an integrated ecosystem with shared user identification, data models, and cross-product functionality. Analytics serves as the data foundation, with Experiment leveraging Analytics data for user enrichment, cohort targeting, and results analysis. Session Replay integrates with Analytics events for contextual session analysis, while Guides and Surveys can trigger based on Analytics behavioral data.

The CDP acts as the data backbone, managing data flow between products and external systems through extensive source and destination catalogs. Warehouse-native capabilities enable direct data warehouse integration, while the Ampli code generation tool ensures consistent instrumentation across the platform.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events and Properties**: The fundamental data model consists of events (user actions) with associated properties (event attributes) and user properties (persistent user characteristics).

**Charts and Analysis**: Various analytical views including segmentation (event analysis over time), funnels (conversion analysis), retention (user return behavior), and cohorts (user groupings based on behavior).

**Deployments**: Organizational units in Experiment that categorize implementations as client-side or server-side, each with unique deployment keys for SDK authentication.

**Variants and Flags**: Experiment configurations where flags represent feature toggles and variants represent different treatment conditions with value or payload properties.

**Bucketing and Targeting**: User assignment mechanisms using consistent hashing algorithms with targeting segments for audience definition and sticky bucketing for consistent assignments.

**Sources and Destinations**: CDP components where sources collect data from various platforms and destinations send data to external systems for activation.

**Audiences and Cohorts**: User segments defined by behavioral criteria, with cohorts being Analytics-specific groupings and audiences being CDP-managed segments.

## SDK and API Architecture

The platform provides comprehensive SDK coverage across multiple programming languages and platforms:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal implementations, each supporting event tracking, user identification, and property management.

**Experiment SDKs** offer both client-side and server-side implementations with consistent initialization patterns, variant fetching, and exposure tracking capabilities.

**Ampli** provides code generation for type-safe event tracking across supported languages, ensuring consistent instrumentation and reducing implementation errors.

Key API endpoints include:
- Analytics REST API v2.0 for event ingestion and data retrieval
- Experiment Management API for programmatic experiment control
- Guides and Surveys API for in-product messaging management
- Various destination APIs for data activation and export

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

The platform includes comprehensive administrative capabilities covering account management, billing and usage monitoring, single sign-on integration, and user permission management. Role-based access control operates at both organization and project levels with granular permissions for different product areas.

Enterprise features include advanced security controls, custom data retention policies, PII handling capabilities, and dedicated support channels. The platform supports multi-site deployments with localization capabilities, including Japanese translation support.

## Data Management and Privacy

Robust data governance features include PII detection and handling, data retention controls, and privacy-compliant data processing. The platform supports various data export and import mechanisms, including warehouse-native integrations for direct data warehouse connectivity.

Source and destination catalogs provide extensive third-party integrations, enabling data collection from various platforms and activation to marketing, analytics, and operational tools. The CDP includes data transformation capabilities and real-time data processing for immediate insights and activation.

## Migration and Onboarding

Comprehensive migration support helps organizations transition from other analytics platforms, with dedicated migration guides, data import tools, and best practice documentation. The get-started section provides structured onboarding paths for different use cases and technical implementations.

The platform includes extensive troubleshooting resources, FAQ sections, and partner integrations to support successful implementations and ongoing optimization of analytics and experimentation programs.
