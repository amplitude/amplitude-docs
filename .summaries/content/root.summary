Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and make data-driven decisions across their digital products. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Core Product Architecture

The platform is built around several key products that work together:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, providing event-based tracking and analysis through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Journeys, Personas, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Revenue LTV, Data Tables, and Compass. The analytics platform supports both individual user analysis and account-level reporting through group analytics.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced techniques, experiment theory, workflow management, and comprehensive results analysis. The platform includes experiment-specific troubleshooting and integrations with the broader Amplitude ecosystem.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and replays user sessions to provide qualitative insights that complement quantitative analytics data.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product messaging and user feedback collection to drive engagement and gather user insights.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation across the entire customer data lifecycle, including audience management, source and destination catalogs, and warehouse-native capabilities.

## Product Relationships and Integration

The products are deeply integrated through shared data models and cross-product workflows. Analytics charts can incorporate experiment data through the Experiment Results chart type, while Session Replay provides qualitative context for quantitative analytics insights. The CDP serves as the data foundation, managing event ingestion and distribution across all products.

The platform supports multi-site deployment with English and Japanese localization, indicating global enterprise capabilities. Collections are organized hierarchically with navigation injection points that create a unified user experience across products.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Collections** represent content groupings within the documentation system, each with specific routing patterns, templates, and navigation contexts. Key navigation contexts include:
- `analytics` - Core analytics functionality
- `experiment` - Feature experimentation and A/B testing
- `data` - CDP and data management features
- `apis` - API documentation and integration guides
- `analytics_sdks` and `experiment_sdks` - Software development kits
- `charts` - Specific analytics chart types
- `admin` - Administrative and account management features

**Mount points** (referenced by UUIDs) indicate content hierarchies and relationships between different documentation sections.

**Blade references** specify product-specific branding, with "Amplitude Experiment" and "Amplitude Session Replay" being explicitly called out as distinct product experiences.

**Sites and propagation** control content distribution across different locales and deployment targets.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The platform integrates extensively with external tools and services through:

**APIs**: Analytics API, Experiment APIs, and Guides and Surveys API provide programmatic access to platform functionality.

**SDKs**: Comprehensive SDK support across platforms including Android, iOS, Browser (JavaScript), React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal, Node.js, Python, Java, and Go, enabling instrumentation across web, mobile, gaming, and server-side applications.

**Ampli**: A code-generation tool that creates type-safe analytics implementations based on tracking plans.

**Integration Catalogs**: Source and destination catalogs enable data flow between Amplitude and hundreds of external tools and platforms.

**Partner Ecosystem**: Dedicated partner integrations extend platform capabilities.

## Technical Implementation

The platform exposes several key API endpoints and integration patterns:

**Route Patterns**: Documentation follows consistent URL structures like `/analytics/{slug}`, `/feature-experiment/{slug}`, `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/{slug}`, and `/apis/{product}/{slug}`.

**Content Management**: Uses YAML-based collection definitions with template inheritance, revision control, and preview capabilities.

**Multi-tenancy**: Supports organization-level isolation with project-based data segregation.

**Instrumentation**: Provides multiple data ingestion methods including HTTP APIs, SDK implementations, and third-party integrations.

The platform represents a mature, enterprise-grade solution for product analytics and experimentation, with sophisticated data management capabilities, extensive integration options, and a comprehensive developer ecosystem. The documentation structure reflects a complex product suite designed to serve organizations from startup to enterprise scale across multiple use cases including product analytics, growth experimentation, user experience optimization, and customer data management.
