Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools for product analytics, feature experimentation, customer data management, and user engagement. The platform consists of several interconnected products designed to help teams understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive business growth through data-driven decision making.

## Core Product Architecture

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational product, offering advanced charting capabilities including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Revenue LTV, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Impact Analysis, and Engagement Matrix. These charts enable deep behavioral analysis through cohort comparisons, user path analysis, and conversion optimization.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced statistical methods, multi-armed bandit algorithms, and sophisticated targeting mechanisms. The platform supports both client-side and server-side experimentation with real-time flag evaluation and comprehensive result analysis.

**Amplitude CDP (Customer Data Platform)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation through Sources, Destinations, Audiences, and warehouse-native capabilities. The platform supports real-time data streaming, batch processing, and identity resolution across multiple touchpoints.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user sessions to provide visual insights into user behavior, enabling teams to identify friction points and optimize user experiences through detailed interaction recordings.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** delivers in-product user engagement through contextual messaging, onboarding flows, feedback collection, and resource centers, supporting multi-platform deployment with sophisticated targeting and personalization capabilities.

## SDK and API Ecosystem

The platform provides comprehensive instrumentation through multiple SDKs:

**Analytics SDKs** support all major platforms including Browser (`@amplitude/analytics-browser`), Android (`com.amplitude:analytics-android`), iOS (`AmplitudeSwift`), React Native (`@amplitude/analytics-react-native`), Flutter (`amplitude_flutter`), Node.js (`@amplitude/analytics-node`), Python (`amplitude-analytics`), Java (`com.amplitude:analytics-java`), Go (`github.com/amplitude/analytics-go`), Unity, and Unreal Engine.

**Experiment SDKs** provide feature flag evaluation across platforms with local evaluation capabilities, remote configuration management, and real-time flag updates. These include client-side SDKs for web and mobile platforms and server-side SDKs for backend services.

**Ampli** serves as a type-safe wrapper that generates strongly-typed tracking libraries from Amplitude's Data taxonomy, ensuring consistent event instrumentation across teams and platforms.

## Key API Endpoints

**Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/`) provides programmatic access to:
- Event ingestion via HTTP API and Batch API
- Query API for chart data retrieval
- Export API for raw event data
- User Profile API for user property management

**Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) include:
- Evaluation API for flag resolution
- Management API for flag configuration
- Results API for experiment metrics
- Deployment API for release management

**Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) enables:
- Content management and publishing
- User targeting and segmentation
- Response data retrieval
- Analytics event tracking

## Data Management and Integration

The platform supports extensive data integration through:

**Source Catalog** with 100+ pre-built connectors for data ingestion from various platforms including web analytics, mobile analytics, customer support, marketing automation, and business intelligence tools.

**Destination Catalog** enabling data activation to downstream systems including marketing platforms, data warehouses, business intelligence tools, and customer engagement platforms.

**Warehouse-native Amplitude** allows direct querying of data warehouse tables, supporting Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, and Databricks with SQL-based analysis capabilities.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** are user actions tracked within applications, containing properties that describe the context and details of the action.

**User Properties** are attributes that describe users and persist across sessions, while **Event Properties** provide context specific to individual events.

**Cohorts** are dynamic user segments based on behavioral criteria, demographic attributes, or custom properties that update automatically as users meet or no longer meet the defined criteria.

**Funnels** track user progression through defined sequences of events, measuring conversion rates and identifying drop-off points in user journeys.

**Retention** measures user return behavior over specified time periods, calculating the percentage of users who perform actions after their initial engagement.

**Amplitude IDs** are unique identifiers assigned to users for cross-platform tracking and identity resolution, while **User IDs** are customer-defined identifiers that map to business logic.

**Feature Flags** are configuration switches that control feature availability and behavior without requiring code deployments, supporting gradual rollouts and instant rollbacks.

**Variants** represent different versions of features or experiences in experiments, with traffic allocation controlled through percentage-based distribution.

**Bucketing** ensures consistent user assignment to experiments and feature flags across sessions and platforms.

## Administrative and Governance Features

**Account Management** provides organization-level controls including user provisioning, role-based access control, and team management with granular permissions across products.

**Single Sign-On (SSO)** supports SAML 2.0 and OIDC protocols for enterprise authentication with providers like Okta, Azure AD, and Google Workspace.

**Billing and Usage** monitoring tracks event volume, user seats, and feature utilization across products with usage alerts and overage management.

**Data Governance** includes PII detection and management, data retention policies, privacy controls, and compliance features for GDPR, CCPA, and other regulations.

## Ecosystem Integration and Partnerships

Amplitude integrates with the broader product and marketing technology stack through:

**Partners Program** featuring certified integrations with major platforms including Segment, mParticle, Rudderstack, Salesforce, HubSpot, Braze, and hundreds of other tools.

**Webhook Support** for real-time data streaming and event-driven workflows.

**Custom Integrations** through REST APIs and SDK extensions for proprietary systems and specialized use cases.

The platform serves as a central hub for product intelligence, connecting data collection, analysis, experimentation, and activation in a unified workflow that supports the complete product development lifecycle from hypothesis generation through impact measurement.
