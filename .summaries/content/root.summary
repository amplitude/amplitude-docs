## Amplitude: Comprehensive Product Analytics and Experimentation Platform

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics platform that provides product teams with tools for user behavior analysis, experimentation, data management, and customer journey optimization. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The platform operates through a hierarchical structure centered around **Analytics** as the core product, with specialized modules for different use cases:

**Analytics Core** serves as the foundation, providing event tracking, user segmentation, and behavioral analysis through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Cohort Analysis, and Revenue LTV. These charts are organized under `/analytics/charts/` with specialized visualizations like Compass, Data Tables, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, Journeys, Lifecycle, Personas, and Stickiness.

**Amplitude Experiment** (`/feature-experiment/`) integrates with Analytics for A/B testing and feature flag management, including advanced techniques, experiment theory, workflow management, and troubleshooting capabilities. It provides both local and remote evaluation through dedicated SDKs (`/sdks/experiment-sdks/`) and APIs (`/apis/experiment/`).

**Session Replay** (`/session-replay/`) captures user interactions for qualitative analysis, complementing quantitative analytics data.

**Guides and Surveys** (`/guides-and-surveys/`) enables in-product messaging and feedback collection, with its own API endpoints (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`).

**Customer Data Platform** (`/data/`) manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation through source catalogs, destination catalogs, audiences, and warehouse-native capabilities.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Collections**: Content organization structure defining routes, templates, and navigation hierarchies for different product areas

**Mount Points**: UUID-based content mounting system (e.g., `mount: ba956cb4-9ae1-456a-b122-984b491048f6`) for dynamic content organization

**Navigation Injection**: System for categorizing content under specific navigation sections (`nav_title: analytics`, `nav_title: experiment`, etc.)

**Blade System**: Product-specific branding and context injection (`blade: Amplitude Experiment`, `blade: Amplitude Session Replay`)

**Sites and Propagation**: Multi-language support system with English (`en`) and Japanese (`jp`) sites, with propagation controls for content distribution

**Route Structures**: Hierarchical URL patterns following `/product-area/feature/specific-topic/` format

**Preview Targets**: Live preview system for content updates with refresh capabilities

**Date Behavior**: Content visibility controls with `past: public` and `future: private` settings

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The platform integrates multiple product areas through shared infrastructure:

**SDK Ecosystem**: Comprehensive SDK catalog supporting multiple platforms including Android, iOS, Browser, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine, all organized under `/sdks/analytics/` with platform-specific documentation

**API Infrastructure**: Unified API system covering Analytics API (`/apis/analytics/`), Experiment APIs, and Guides and Surveys API, providing programmatic access to platform capabilities

**Data Integration**: Extensive source and destination catalog for third-party integrations, PII handling, and warehouse-native implementations

**Administrative Functions**: Centralized admin capabilities including account management (`/admin/account-management/`), billing and usage tracking (`/admin/billing-use/`), and single sign-on configuration (`/admin/single-sign-on/`)

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Analytics API**: `/apis/analytics/` - Event ingestion, query execution, and data retrieval
**Experiment APIs**: `/apis/experiment/` - Feature flag evaluation, experiment configuration, and results analysis  
**Guides and Surveys API**: `/apis/guides-and-surveys/` - In-product messaging and survey management
**SDK Endpoints**: Platform-specific implementation guides under `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/`
**Ampli**: Type-safe analytics implementation tool at `/sdks/ampli/`

## Advanced Features and Capabilities

**Multi-Language Support**: Japanese translation capabilities (`/japanese_translation`) with site-specific content management

**Partner Ecosystem**: Dedicated partner integration documentation (`/partners/`) for third-party tool connections

**Migration Tools**: Comprehensive migration support (`/migration/`) for platform transitions

**Academy Content**: Educational resources and training materials for platform adoption

**Troubleshooting Infrastructure**: Dedicated FAQ and troubleshooting sections (`/faq/`) with experiment-specific troubleshooting capabilities

**Legacy Support**: Maintained documentation for legacy chart types while promoting modern alternatives

**Warehouse-Native Architecture**: Direct data warehouse integration capabilities for enterprise-scale implementations

The platform emphasizes a developer-friendly approach with extensive SDK support, comprehensive API coverage, and detailed documentation structure that supports both technical implementation and business user adoption across the entire product analytics lifecycle.
