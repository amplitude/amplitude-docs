# Amplitude Product Documentation Overview

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and data activation platform that helps businesses understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-informed decisions. The platform consists of several interconnected products:

1. **Analytics** - Core analytics functionality for tracking, visualizing, and analyzing user behavior
2. **Experiment** - Feature experimentation and A/B testing capabilities
3. **CDP (Customer Data Platform)** - User data management and audience segmentation
4. **SDKs** - Client and server libraries for various platforms to instrument applications
5. **APIs** - Programmatic interfaces for data access and integration
6. **Destination Catalog** - Integration hub for activating data in third-party platforms

The platform supports various visualization tools including charts, funnels, user journeys, cohort analysis, and impact measurement to help teams understand user behavior and make data-driven decisions.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Amplitude ecosystem is structured as follows:

1. **Data Collection Layer**:
   - SDKs for various platforms (Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal, Node.js, Python, Java, Go)
   - Ampli SDK wrapper for type-safe instrumentation
   - Server-side and client-side tracking options

2. **Data Processing Layer**:
   - Source Catalog for data ingestion
   - PII management for data privacy
   - Data tables for structured analysis

3. **Analytics Layer**:
   - Charts for visualization (Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention, User Sessions, etc.)
   - Compass for guided analytics
   - Personas for user segmentation
   - Engagement Matrix for behavioral analysis

4. **Activation Layer**:
   - Destination Catalog with 100+ integrations
   - Cohort syncing and event streaming
   - User Profile API for personalization

5. **Experimentation Layer**:
   - Web experiments
   - SDK-based experiments
   - Impact analysis
   - Experiment results visualization

6. **Administration Layer**:
   - Account Management
   - Billing and Usage
   - Single Sign-On
   - User permissions

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: A discrete user action or system occurrence tracked in Amplitude
- **User**: An individual interacting with a product, identified by a unique ID
- **Cohort**: A group of users defined by specific behaviors or characteristics
- **Session**: A period of continuous user engagement with a product
- **Funnel**: A sequence of events representing a user journey or conversion path
- **Retention**: Measurement of how users return to a product over time
- **Property**: Metadata attached to events or users providing additional context
- **Segment**: A subset of data filtered by specific criteria
- **Chart**: Visualization of analytics data in various formats
- **SDK (Software Development Kit)**: Libraries for instrumenting applications
- **Source**: Platform or service from which data is collected
- **Destination**: Third-party platform receiving data from Amplitude
- **Experiment**: A controlled test comparing variations of a feature
- **Variant**: A specific version of a feature being tested in an experiment
- **Impact Analysis**: Measurement of experiment effects on key metrics

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude platform components work together in an integrated workflow:

1. **Data Collection**: Applications instrumented with SDKs send event data to Amplitude
2. **Data Processing**: Events are processed, enriched, and stored for analysis
3. **Analysis**: Users explore data through charts, funnels, and other visualizations
4. **Segmentation**: Users create cohorts based on behavior patterns
5. **Activation**: Cohorts and events are sent to destinations for targeted actions
6. **Experimentation**: Features are tested with controlled experiments
7. **Measurement**: Impact of changes is measured through analytics

The platform supports cross-product workflows such as:
- Creating cohorts in Analytics and activating them through the Destination Catalog
- Running experiments and measuring results in Analytics charts
- Using CDP data to enrich analytics and power personalization

## API Endpoints and Integration Points

Amplitude provides several API endpoints for programmatic integration:

- **Analytics API**: `https://amplitude.com/api/2/events` - For sending events
- **User Profile API**: `https://profile-api.amplitude.com/v1/userprofile` - For retrieving user profiles
- **Cohort API**: `https://amplitude.com/api/2/cohorts/export` - For exporting cohorts
- **Export API**: `https://amplitude.com/api/2/export` - For exporting raw event data
- **Experiment API**: `https://api.lab.amplitude.com/v1/vardata` - For experiment variant assignment

Command line tools and SDK initialization examples:

```javascript
// Browser SDK initialization
amplitude.init('API_KEY', {
  serverUrl: 'https://api.amplitude.com',
  logLevel: 3,
  includeUtm: true,
  includeReferrer: true
});

// Tracking an event
amplitude.track('Button Clicked', {
  buttonColor: 'blue',
  buttonText: 'Sign Up'
});
```

```python
# Python SDK initialization
from amplitude import Amplitude

amplitude = Amplitude('API_KEY')
amplitude.track(
    event_type='Button Clicked',
    user_id='user123',
    event_properties={
        'buttonColor': 'blue',
        'buttonText': 'Sign Up'
    }
)
```
