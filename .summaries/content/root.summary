- **Web Experiment**: Web-specific experimentation tools
- **Experiment Results**: Analytics for measuring experiment outcomes
- **Workflow Management**: Process tools for experimentation
- **Advanced Techniques**: Sophisticated experimentation methodologies

### Data Management
The platform includes robust data handling capabilities:
- **Data Sources**: Integrations for importing data
- **Source Catalog**: Directory of available data integrations
- **Destination Catalog**: Options for exporting data
- **Audiences**: User segmentation and targeting
- **CDP (Customer Data Platform)**: Unified customer data management
- **PII Integrations**: Handling of personally identifiable information

### Developer Tools and SDKs
Amplitude offers implementation tools for various platforms:
- **Ampli**: Type-safe wrapper SDK
- **Analytics SDKs**: Platform-specific SDKs for Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal, Node.js, Python, Java, and Go
- **Experiment SDKs**: SDKs specifically for experimentation features
- **Instrumentation**: Implementation guidance for tracking

## Product Relationships and Architecture

Amplitude's platform follows a logical flow:

1. **Data Collection**: Using SDKs and integrations, user behavior data is captured across platforms
2. **Data Processing**: The core platform processes and organizes this data
3. **Analysis**: Analytics tools provide insights into user behavior
4. **Action**: Experimentation and integration features enable acting on insights

The products are designed to work together seamlessly:
- **Analytics** provides the insights that inform **Experiment** hypotheses
- **Data** management tools ensure quality input for both analytics and experimentation
- **SDKs** facilitate implementation across platforms
- **APIs** enable custom integrations and workflows

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Events**: User actions tracked in the system (e.g., "Button Clicked", "Purchase Completed")
- **Properties**: Metadata associated with events or users (e.g., button color, purchase amount)
- **Cohorts**: Defined groups of users based on behavior or attributes
- **Journeys**: Visualization of user paths through a product
- **Funnels**: Sequential series of events that track conversion
- **Retention**: Measurement of how users return to a product over time
- **Segmentation**: Breaking down metrics by user attributes
- **Experiments**: Controlled tests of product variations
- **Instrumentation**: The process of implementing tracking code

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude functions as an end-to-end analytics and experimentation platform:

- **Data Collection Layer**: SDKs and integrations capture user behavior
- **Data Management Layer**: Processing, organization, and storage of user data
- **Analysis Layer**: Visualization and insight generation
- **Action Layer**: Experimentation and integration with other tools

The platform supports a complete analytics lifecycle from data collection to action, with each product addressing a specific part of this workflow.
