Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of several interconnected products that form a complete customer data and analytics ecosystem.

## Core Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational product, providing behavioral analytics through various chart types including Event Segmentation for analyzing user actions, Funnel Analysis for conversion tracking, Retention Analysis for user lifecycle understanding, Cohort Analysis through Lifecycle charts, User Journey mapping via Journeys, Engagement Matrix for feature adoption analysis, Stickiness for usage frequency measurement, Revenue LTV for monetization insights, Impact Analysis for feature performance, and Personas for user segmentation. The platform also includes Data Tables for raw data exploration and Legacy Charts for backward compatibility.

**Amplitude Experiment** enables feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities, integrating deeply with the analytics platform to measure experiment impact. It includes advanced techniques for sophisticated testing scenarios, experiment theory documentation, workflow management, troubleshooting resources, and comprehensive result analysis through dedicated chart types.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user sessions to provide qualitative insights that complement quantitative analytics data, enabling teams to understand the "why" behind user behaviors identified in analytics charts.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** delivers in-product user experience optimization through contextual guides, feedback collection surveys, and intelligent resource centers that respond to behavioral insights in real-time.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation across the ecosystem, supporting both source and destination integrations while maintaining data quality and governance standards.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** represent discrete user actions tracked within applications, while **Properties** provide contextual information about events and users. **Cohorts** define user segments based on behavioral criteria, and **Audiences** extend segmentation capabilities for activation use cases.

**Instrumentation** refers to the implementation of tracking code through various SDKs (Software Development Kits) that collect behavioral data. **Ampli** serves as a type-safe wrapper that ensures consistent event tracking across platforms and teams.

**Feature Flags** control feature rollouts and enable experimentation, while **Variants** represent different versions of features being tested. **Bucketing** determines which users see which variants, and **Exposure Events** track when users encounter experiments.

**Sources** represent data input systems, while **Destinations** are external platforms that receive processed data. **Transformations** modify data as it flows through the CDP pipeline.

**Charts** are analytical visualizations, **Dashboards** combine multiple charts for comprehensive reporting, and **Notebooks** provide collaborative analysis environments. **Microscope** enables detailed session-level analysis.

## SDK and API Architecture

The platform provides extensive SDK support across multiple programming languages and platforms:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser SDK for web applications, iOS and Android SDKs for mobile platforms, React Native for cross-platform mobile development, Flutter for multi-platform applications, Node.js and Python for server-side tracking, Java and Go for enterprise backend systems, and Unity/Unreal for gaming applications.

**Experiment SDKs** provide feature flagging capabilities across the same platform ecosystem, enabling consistent experimentation workflows regardless of technology stack.

**API Endpoints** include:
- Analytics API (`/apis/analytics/`) for data ingestion and querying
- Experiment APIs (`/apis/experiment/`) for flag management and variant assignment  
- Guides and Surveys API (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) for experience management
- Various chart-specific APIs for programmatic access to analytical insights

**Command Line Tools** and programmatic interfaces enable automation of common workflows including data export, experiment management, and integration setup.

## Data Management and Integration Ecosystem

**Source Catalog** encompasses pre-built integrations for data ingestion from various platforms including web analytics tools, mobile analytics platforms, marketing automation systems, customer support platforms, and custom data sources through HTTP API and SDK implementations.

**Destination Catalog** provides data activation capabilities through integrations with marketing platforms, customer success tools, data warehouses, business intelligence systems, and custom destinations via webhook and API configurations.

**Warehouse-native Amplitude** enables analysis of data stored in customer data warehouses without requiring data movement, supporting major cloud data platforms while maintaining Amplitude's analytical capabilities.

**PII (Personally Identifiable Information) Integrations** provide secure handling of sensitive user data with appropriate privacy controls and compliance features.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** includes user provisioning, role-based access control, and organizational structure management. **Single Sign-On (SSO)** integration supports enterprise authentication systems including SAML and OAuth providers.

**Billing and Usage** management provides cost control and usage monitoring across all platform products, with detailed breakdowns by product area and user activity.

**Migration** tools and documentation support transitions from other analytics platforms, ensuring data continuity and minimal disruption during platform adoption.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The platform integrates with numerous **Partners** including technology vendors, consulting firms, and implementation specialists who extend Amplitude's capabilities and provide specialized services.

**Academy Content** provides comprehensive educational resources including certification programs, best practices documentation, and training materials for different user roles and experience levels.

**FAQ and Troubleshooting** resources support both technical implementation issues and analytical methodology questions, with platform-specific guidance for different products and use cases.

The documentation supports **Japanese Translation** for international users, indicating global platform availability and localization support.

**Get Started** resources provide onboarding guidance for new users, while **Instrumentation** documentation covers technical implementation across all supported platforms and SDKs.

The platform represents a comprehensive solution for digital product analytics, experimentation, and user experience optimization, with deep integrations across the customer data lifecycle from collection through activation. The modular architecture allows organizations to adopt individual products or implement the complete ecosystem based on their specific needs and maturity levels.
