Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools for understanding user behavior, conducting experiments, and managing data across their digital products. The platform consists of several interconnected products that work together to provide end-to-end analytics and optimization capabilities.

## Core Product Suite

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics platform, offering event tracking, user behavior analysis, and comprehensive reporting through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, Cohort Analysis, and User Journey mapping. The analytics engine supports advanced features like Personas for user segmentation, Compass for KPI monitoring, and specialized charts for engagement matrices, lifecycle analysis, and revenue LTV tracking.

**Amplitude Experiment** is the feature flagging and A/B testing platform that enables controlled feature rollouts and experimentation. It supports both remote and local evaluation methods, with comprehensive SDK coverage across client-side and server-side implementations. The platform includes advanced targeting capabilities, statistical analysis tools, and integration with the broader Amplitude ecosystem for seamless user identification and assignment tracking.

**Amplitude Session Replay** provides detailed session recordings and user interaction analysis, allowing teams to understand user behavior at a granular level through actual session playback and interaction heatmaps.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user engagement through targeted messaging, onboarding flows, and feedback collection mechanisms.

## Data Infrastructure and Customer Data Platform (CDP)

The platform includes a robust **Customer Data Platform** that manages data ingestion, transformation, and distribution across the ecosystem. Key components include:

**Source Catalog**: Pre-built integrations for data ingestion from various platforms, categorized by integration types and supporting real-time and batch data collection.

**Destination Catalog**: Extensive library of data export destinations, enabling organizations to sync Amplitude data with their existing marketing, analytics, and operational tools.

**Audiences**: Dynamic user segmentation capabilities that create actionable cohorts based on behavioral data, which can be synced to external platforms for targeted campaigns.

**Warehouse-native Amplitude**: Direct integration with data warehouses, allowing organizations to run Amplitude analytics on their existing data infrastructure without data movement.

## SDK and Integration Architecture

The platform provides comprehensive instrumentation through multiple SDK categories:

**Analytics SDKs**: Platform-specific SDKs for event tracking including Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine implementations. Each SDK supports both client-side and server-side tracking with features like automatic session management, offline queuing, and real-time event validation.

**Experiment SDKs**: Dedicated SDKs for feature flagging and experimentation, supporting both remote and local evaluation patterns. These include client-side SDKs for web and mobile platforms, and server-side SDKs for backend services.

**Ampli**: A code-generation tool that creates type-safe analytics implementations, ensuring data quality and consistency across development teams by generating strongly-typed tracking libraries from centrally defined tracking plans.

## API Ecosystem

The platform exposes comprehensive APIs for programmatic access:

**Analytics API**: RESTful endpoints for event ingestion, user management, and data export with endpoints like `/batch` for bulk event ingestion and `/export` for data extraction.

**Experiment APIs**: Management and evaluation APIs for feature flags, including flag configuration, user assignment, and results analysis.

**Guides and Surveys API**: Programmatic control over in-product messaging and survey deployment.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management**: Multi-organization support with role-based access control, team management, and project isolation capabilities.

**Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Enterprise authentication integration supporting SAML and OAuth protocols for seamless organizational access control.

**Billing and Usage**: Comprehensive usage tracking and billing management with event volume monitoring, plan management, and usage analytics.

## Key Nomenclature and Concepts

**Events**: Discrete user actions tracked within applications, forming the foundation of all analytics and experimentation.

**User Properties**: Attributes associated with users that persist across sessions and enable segmentation and targeting.

**Event Properties**: Contextual data associated with specific events, providing detailed information about user actions.

**Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments based on behavioral criteria, used for analysis and targeting across the platform.

**Variants**: Different experiences in experiments, assigned to users based on targeting criteria and statistical distribution requirements.

**Deployment Keys**: Authentication credentials that identify specific environments and determine available configurations for SDKs.

**Taxonomies**: Organizational structures for categorizing integrations and content, particularly used in source and destination catalogs with integration_category classifications.

## Content and Documentation Architecture

The platform includes extensive educational resources through **Academy Content** and comprehensive documentation covering implementation guides, troubleshooting resources, migration assistance, and partner integrations. The documentation supports multiple languages including Japanese translations and provides specialized content for different user roles from developers to business analysts.

**FAQ and Troubleshooting** sections provide comprehensive support resources, while **Migration** guides assist organizations transitioning from other analytics platforms.

The platform's **Partners** ecosystem includes certified integrations and professional services providers, extending the platform's capabilities through third-party expertise and specialized implementations.

This comprehensive architecture enables organizations to implement sophisticated analytics and experimentation programs while maintaining data quality, user privacy, and operational efficiency across their entire digital product portfolio.
