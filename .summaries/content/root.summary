- **Workflow**: End-to-end experiment lifecycle management
- **Under the Hood**: Technical implementation details and system architecture
- **Experiment Results**: Results analysis and statistical significance testing
- **Experiment Troubleshooting**: Debugging and optimization guidance

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** - Comprehensive data management and integration layer:
- **Sources**: Data ingestion from various platforms and systems
- **Audiences**: Dynamic user segmentation and audience management

- **Source Catalog**: Available data source integrations and configurations
- **Warehouse-native Amplitude**: Direct data warehouse integration capabilities

**Additional Products**:
- **Amplitude Session Replay**: User session recording and playback for qualitative analysis
- **Amplitude Guides and Surveys**: In-product messaging and user feedback collection

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Analytics Concepts:**
- **Events**: User actions tracked within applications (clicks, page views, purchases)
- **Properties**: Attributes associated with events (event properties) or users (user properties)
- **Segments**: Filtered groups of users or events based on specific criteria
- **Cohorts**: Time-based user groups for retention and lifecycle analysis
- **Funnels**: Sequential event flows representing user conversion paths
- **Amplitude ID**: Unique user identifier for cross-platform user tracking

**Experimentation Terminology:**
- **Feature Flags**: Boolean or multi-variant configuration controls for feature rollouts
- **Variants**: Different treatment versions within experiments
- **Bucketing**: User assignment mechanism for experiment participation
- **Mutex Groups**: Traffic allocation containers preventing experiment interference
- **Holdout Groups**: Control populations for measuring overall experiment program impact
- **Remote vs Local Evaluation**: Server-side vs client-side flag evaluation strategies

**Data Management:**
- **Taxonomies**: Organized classification systems for content and integrations
- **Mount Points**: Content organization structure using unique identifiers
- **Propagation**: Multi-site content distribution settings
- **Integration Categories**: Classification system for source and destination connectors

**Platform Infrastructure:**
- **Deployment Keys**: Environment-specific authentication for evaluation APIs
- **Management API Keys**: Administrative access tokens for configuration management
- **Navigation Injection**: Dynamic content categorization for documentation organization

## Ecosystem Integration and Broader Platform Context

The Amplitude platform operates as an integrated ecosystem where data flows seamlessly between products:

**Data Flow Architecture**: Events collected through Analytics SDKs automatically feed into the CDP for audience creation, which can then be used for experiment targeting in Amplitude Experiment, with results flowing back to Analytics for impact measurement.

**Multi-Product Integration**: Session Replay integrations provide qualitative context to quantitative Analytics insights, while Guides and Surveys enable direct user feedback collection based on behavioral segments identified through Analytics.

**Developer Ecosystem**: Comprehensive SDK support across platforms (iOS, Android, Browser, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal, Node.js, Python, Java, Go) with both Analytics and Experiment SDKs, plus the Ampli wrapper for type-safe event tracking.

**Enterprise Features**: Administrative capabilities including Single Sign-On, account management, billing controls, and PII handling integrations for compliance requirements.

**Partner Ecosystem**: Extensive integration catalog supporting data ingestion from marketing platforms, CRMs, databases, and data activation to advertising platforms, email tools, and business intelligence systems.

## API Specifications and Technical Implementation

**Analytics API Endpoints**:
- Event ingestion APIs for real-time data collection
- Query APIs for programmatic access to analytics results
- Export APIs for raw data extraction and warehouse integration

**Experiment API Structure**:
- **Evaluation API**: `/v1/vardata` for remote evaluation, `/v1/flags` for local evaluation configuration
- **Management API**: RESTful endpoints for experiment lifecycle management (`/api/1/experiments`, `/api/1/flags`, `/api/1/deployments`)
- **Authentication**: Deployment keys for evaluation, Bearer tokens for management operations
- **Rate Limiting**: 100 requests/second with cursor-based pagination

**Guides and Surveys API**: 
- Content management and delivery APIs for in-product messaging
- Response collection and analytics integration

**SDK Integration Patterns**:
- **Analytics SDKs**: Event tracking with automatic session management and user identification
- **Experiment SDKs**: Flag evaluation with automatic assignment event tracking
- **Framework Integrations**: Platform-specific implementations for React, Angular, and other frameworks
- **Ampli**: Code-generated type-safe tracking libraries with IDE integration

**Multi-Site Architecture**: Support for internationalization with English (`en`) and Japanese (`jp`) site variants, including localized content routing and region-specific data residency compliance through dedicated server endpoints.

The platform's documentation architecture uses a sophisticated content management system with mount-based organization, allowing for modular content structure while maintaining consistent navigation and user experience across the entire product ecosystem.
