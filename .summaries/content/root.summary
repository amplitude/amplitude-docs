Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform integrates analytics, experimentation, session replay, user engagement tools, and customer data management into a unified ecosystem.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform centers around **Amplitude Analytics** as the foundational analytics engine, providing diverse visualization and analysis capabilities through specialized chart types. Event Segmentation tracks user actions, Funnel Analysis optimizes conversions, Retention Analysis measures user engagement, and Cohort Analysis through Lifecycle charts examines user groups over time. Additional capabilities include User Journey mapping via Journeys charts, Revenue LTV analysis, Engagement Matrix for behavioral patterns, Impact Analysis for feature assessment, Stickiness analysis, User Sessions analysis, Personas for segmentation, Data Tables for raw data exploration, and Compass for metric monitoring.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers feature flagging and A/B testing with advanced statistical analysis, supporting experiment design, variant management, statistical significance testing, and results analysis through dedicated experiment results charts. The system includes sophisticated targeting capabilities and rollout management integrated with the broader ecosystem.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures user sessions for qualitative behavioral insights, while **Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product experience optimization through contextual guidance and feedback collection via modals, popovers, tooltips, banners, and checklists.

## Data Infrastructure and Customer Data Platform

The **Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation across the ecosystem. It encompasses comprehensive source and destination catalogs for third-party integrations, audience management capabilities, and data governance features. **Sources** handle data ingestion from various platforms, while **Destinations** enable data activation to downstream tools. The **Audience** functionality provides sophisticated user segmentation and targeting capabilities across products.

The platform supports warehouse-native implementations through **Warehouse-native Amplitude**, allowing organizations to maintain data in existing infrastructure while leveraging Amplitude's analytics capabilities.

## SDK and API Ecosystem

Amplitude provides extensive **Software Development Kits (SDKs)** across multiple platforms:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser SDK, Android SDK, iOS SDK, React Native SDK, Flutter SDK, Node.js SDK, Python SDK, Java SDK, Go SDK, Unity SDK, and Unreal SDK, covering web, mobile, backend, and gaming applications.

**Experiment SDKs** provide feature flagging and experimentation capabilities across the same platform ecosystem with consistent implementation patterns.

**Ampli** serves as a type-safe wrapper around Amplitude SDKs, providing compile-time validation and improved developer experience through code generation and schema enforcement.

## API Infrastructure

The platform exposes comprehensive programmatic access through multiple APIs:

**Analytics API** enables data ingestion, event tracking, and analytics data retrieval with endpoints for event submission, user property management, and query execution.

**Experiment APIs** provide programmatic control over feature flags, experiment configuration, and variant assignment with real-time flag evaluation and user targeting.

**Guides and Surveys API** allows programmatic management of in-product experiences, content delivery, and response collection.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** represent user actions or system occurrences tracked within applications, forming the analytics and experimentation foundation. **Properties** are attributes associated with events or users, enabling segmentation and analysis. **Cohorts** are user segments defined by shared characteristics or behaviors for targeting and analysis.

**Funnels** represent sequential user journeys through defined steps for conversion analysis. **Experiments** are controlled tests comparing product variations to measure impact on key metrics. **Feature Flags** are toggles controlling feature availability and behavior for gradual rollouts and experimentation. **Variants** are different versions of features or experiences tested within experiments.

**Targeting** refers to rules and criteria determining which users see specific features or experiments. **Instrumentation** is the process of implementing tracking code to capture user interactions and system events.

## Administrative and Management Features

**Account Management** provides organizational controls, user management, and access permissions across the platform. **Billing and Use** tracks platform usage, manages subscription limits, and provides cost optimization insights. **Single Sign-On (SSO)** enables enterprise authentication integration with identity providers.

The platform implements sophisticated **Permission Systems** with role-based access control, allowing organizations to manage user access across different products and features.

## Advanced Capabilities and Developer Resources

**Advanced Techniques** in experimentation include statistical methodologies, power analysis, sequential testing, and advanced targeting strategies. **Experiment Theory** covers statistical foundations, hypothesis testing, significance calculations, and experimental design best practices. **Under the Hood** documentation explains technical implementation details, algorithms, and architectural decisions.

**Migration** tools and documentation support transitions from other analytics platforms, ensuring data continuity and minimal disruption. The platform provides extensive **FAQ and Troubleshooting** resources, **Academy Content** for education and training, and **Partners** integration for third-party tools and services. **Legacy Charts** maintain backward compatibility for deprecated visualization types while encouraging migration to newer alternatives.

The platform supports multiple deployment models including cloud-hosted solutions and warehouse-native implementations, providing flexibility for organizations with varying data infrastructure requirements and preferences.
