## Amplitude Analytics and Experimentation Platform

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform designed for product teams to analyze user behavior, conduct feature experiments, manage customer data, and drive user engagement. The platform integrates multiple specialized products into a unified ecosystem for end-to-end product intelligence and optimization.

## Product Architecture and Component Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem consists of five core product areas that share data models and integrate seamlessly:

**Analytics Core** serves as the foundational behavioral analysis engine, featuring specialized chart types for different analytical use cases:
- Event Segmentation for granular user action analysis
- Funnel Analysis for conversion optimization
- Retention Analysis for engagement measurement
- User Sessions and Journeys for behavioral path analysis
- Revenue LTV for monetization insights
- Advanced cohort analysis through Compass, Lifecycle, Personas, and Stickiness charts
- Engagement Matrix and Impact Analysis for sophisticated behavioral modeling

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with native analytics integration, including statistical analysis frameworks, advanced targeting mechanisms, dedicated experiment chart types, and comprehensive workflow management for the complete experimentation lifecycle.

**Session Replay** captures and analyzes user session recordings to provide qualitative insights complementing quantitative analytics data.

**Guides and Surveys** enables in-product messaging and feedback collection for user engagement and research initiatives.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages comprehensive data operations including source/destination catalogs for integration, audience segmentation, data governance with PII management, and warehouse-native capabilities for existing data infrastructure.

## Technical Nomenclature and System Architecture

**Collections Structure** - Documentation follows a hierarchical organization with routing patterns like `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/{slug}` and `/feature-experiment/{category}/{slug}`, enabling systematic content discovery.

**Mount Points** - Collections utilize UUID-based mount identifiers to create cross-references and relationships between documentation sections across the platform.

**Navigation Injection** - Each collection injects specific navigation contexts (`nav_title`) including `analytics`, `experiment`, `data`, and `apis` for contextual browsing experiences.

**Blade Architecture** - Product-specific functionality and branding injection system with collections tagged for individual products like "Amplitude Experiment", "Amplitude Session Replay", and "Amplitude Guides and Surveys".

**Site Propagation** - Multi-language documentation support with English (`en`) as primary language and Japanese (`jp`) translations, featuring controlled propagation settings across collections.

**Preview Targets** - All collections support live preview functionality with automatic refresh capabilities for real-time documentation updates.

## SDK and API Implementation Framework

**Analytics SDK Ecosystem** provides comprehensive instrumentation across platforms:
- **Web Implementation**: Browser SDK with advanced autocapture and attribution capabilities
- **Mobile Platforms**: Native SDKs for iOS, Android, React Native, and Flutter
- **Server-Side Integration**: SDKs for Node.js, Python, Java, and Go
- **Gaming Platforms**: Specialized SDKs for Unity and Unreal Engine
- **Ampli Code Generation**: Type-safe tracking implementation generator that creates strongly-typed SDKs from data schemas

**Experiment SDKs** deliver dedicated feature flagging and experimentation capabilities with consistent experiment evaluation across all supported platforms.

**API Endpoints** expose RESTful interfaces for:
- Analytics data ingestion and querying (`/apis/analytics/`)
- Experiment configuration and evaluation (`/apis/experiment/`)
- Guides and Surveys management (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`)

## Enterprise and Administrative Capabilities

**Account Management** provides organization-level controls for user access, permissions, and resource allocation across the platform.

**Single Sign-On (SSO)** enables enterprise authentication integration for secure, centralized access management.

**Billing and Usage** offers consumption monitoring and billing management for enterprise deployments with usage-based pricing models.

**Data Governance** implements PII handling, compliance controls, and configurable data retention policies for regulatory compliance.

## Integration and Partner Ecosystem

**Source Catalog** contains pre-built integrations for data ingestion from various platforms and services, organized by integration type and data source category.

**Destination Catalog** provides data export and activation integrations for marketing automation, analytics platforms, and business intelligence tools.

**Partners Program** encompasses third-party integrations and professional services ecosystem for extended platform capabilities.

**Experiment Integrations** offer platform-specific integrations for feature flag delivery and experiment analysis across different technology stacks.

## Onboarding and Migration Support

**Get Started** workflows provide comprehensive onboarding experiences for new users and organizations with guided setup processes.

**Migration Guides** offer platform-specific assistance for users transitioning from other analytics or experimentation platforms, including data migration strategies.

**Academy Content** delivers educational resources and implementation best practices for analytics methodology and experimentation frameworks.

**FAQ and Troubleshooting** provides self-service support resources with platform-specific troubleshooting guides and common implementation patterns.

The Amplitude platform architecture emphasizes unified data models across products, enabling teams to adopt individual components while maintaining cross-product insights and analytical continuity. The modular design supports both standalone product usage and integrated workflows for comprehensive product intelligence operations.
