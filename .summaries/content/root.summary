## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event** - A discrete user action or system occurrence tracked in Amplitude
- **User/Device ID** - Unique identifier for tracking individual users across sessions
- **Session** - A period of continuous user activity
- **Funnel** - A sequence of events representing a conversion path
- **Retention** - Measurement of users returning to the product over time
- **Segmentation** - Breaking down metrics by user properties or behaviors
- **Cohort** - A group of users who share common characteristics
- **Experiment** - A controlled test comparing different variations of a feature
- **SDK (Software Development Kit)** - Client libraries for implementing Amplitude in applications
- **Ampli** - Code generation tool for type-safe analytics implementation
- **Source/Destination** - Integration points for importing/exporting data
- **CDP (Customer Data Platform)** - System for unifying customer data across sources
- **PII (Personally Identifiable Information)** - Sensitive user data requiring special handling

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude platform is designed as an integrated ecosystem where data flows between components:

1. **Data Collection Layer**:
   - SDKs capture events from various platforms
   - Sources bring in data from external systems
   - APIs enable programmatic data ingestion

2. **Data Processing Layer**:
   - Events are processed, enriched, and stored
   - User profiles are maintained and updated
   - Data is prepared for analysis

3. **Analysis Layer**:
   - Charts and visualizations provide insights
   - Session Replay offers visual context
   - Experiment results measure impact

4. **Action Layer**:
   - Audiences segment users for targeting
   - Destinations export data to other systems
   - Experiments implement variations based on insights

The platform supports a workflow where insights from analytics drive experiments, which generate more data for analysis, creating a continuous improvement cycle.

## API Endpoints and Implementation

### Analytics API

```
POST https://api.amplitude.com/2/httpapi
```
Used for sending events to Amplitude.

### Experiment API

```
GET https://experiment.amplitude.com/api/1/flags/{project_id}
```
Retrieves feature flag configurations.

### SDK Implementation Examples

**Browser SDK:**
```javascript
import * as amplitude from '@amplitude/analytics-browser';
amplitude.init('API_KEY');
amplitude.track('Event Name', { property: 'value' });
```

**iOS SDK:**
```swift
let amplitude = Amplitude(configuration: Configuration(apiKey: "API_KEY"))
amplitude.track(event: BaseEvent(eventType: "Event Name"))
```

**Android SDK:**
```kotlin
val amplitude = Amplitude(Configuration(apiKey = "API_KEY", context = applicationContext))
amplitude.track(BaseEvent(eventType = "Event Name"))
```

**Experiment SDK:**
```javascript
import { Experiment } from '@amplitude/experiment-js-client';
const experiment = Experiment.initialize('API_KEY');
const variant = await experiment.fetch('user-id');
const flagValue = experiment.evaluate('flag-key', 'default-value');
```

The Amplitude platform is designed to be flexible, allowing customers to implement only the components they need while maintaining the ability to expand to additional functionality as their analytics needs grow.
