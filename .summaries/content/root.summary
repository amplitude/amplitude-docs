Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, conduct A/B tests, and manage feature rollouts through an integrated suite of analytics and experimentation tools.

## Core Product Suite

**Amplitude Analytics** forms the platform's foundation, providing event tracking, user segmentation, and behavioral analysis through specialized chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, Cohort Analysis, and User Journey mapping. The analytics engine processes data in real-time and delivers insights into user engagement patterns, conversion funnels, and product performance metrics.

**Amplitude Experiment** handles feature flagging and A/B testing, enabling controlled feature rollouts and statistical experimentation. It operates in both remote evaluation (server-computed assignments) and local evaluation (client-side processing with real-time streaming) modes, with comprehensive SDK coverage across client-side and server-side implementations.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and reconstructs user sessions to provide visual insights into user interactions and identify friction points in the user experience.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** facilitates in-product messaging, user onboarding flows, and feedback collection through targeted surveys and contextual guides.

The **Customer Data Platform (CDP)** provides data ingestion, transformation, and routing capabilities through extensive source and destination catalogs, enabling organizations to centralize customer data and distribute it across their technology stack.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

The platform employs a hub-and-spoke architecture with Analytics at the center. Data flows from various sources through the CDP into Analytics for processing, segmentation, and audience creation. These audiences and insights then feed into Experiment for targeted feature rollouts and A/B testing.

**Ampli** serves as a code generation tool that creates type-safe tracking libraries, ensuring consistent event instrumentation across organizations and bridging product requirements with technical implementation.

**Agents** provide automated insights and anomaly detection, surfacing important behavioral trends and changes without requiring manual analysis.

The platform supports multi-site deployments with content localization capabilities, including dedicated Japanese translation and region-specific data residency options with EU data centers for GDPR compliance.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** represent discrete user actions tracked within applications, forming the analytical foundation across all platform features.

**Properties** are attributes associated with events or users that enable segmentation and targeting capabilities.

**Cohorts** are dynamic user segments based on behavioral criteria, usable across Analytics, Experiment, and other platform features.

**Variants** in experimentation represent different user experiences, containing configuration data and feature flags.

**Deployment Keys** authenticate SDK implementations and determine accessible project environments and feature flags.

**Exposure Tracking** automatically logs user encounters with experiment variants, enabling accurate statistical analysis with 24-hour deduplication.

**Flag Configurations** define targeting rules, allocation percentages, and variant assignments for feature flags.

**Taxonomies** provide organizational structure for integrations and content, particularly within source and destination catalogs.

## Technical Implementation

The platform offers extensive SDK coverage across programming languages and platforms:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, and specialized framework implementations.

**Experiment SDKs** mirror this coverage with both client-side and server-side implementations, supporting remote and local evaluation modes.

**API Coverage** encompasses Analytics APIs for event ingestion and querying, Experiment APIs for flag management and evaluation, and Guides and Surveys APIs for in-product messaging control.

Common SDK implementation patterns include:
- `initialize()` methods with Amplitude Analytics integration
- `track()` for event logging with automatic user context
- `fetch()` and `evaluate()` for experiment variant retrieval
- `start()` for local evaluation with flag streaming
- Automatic exposure tracking with built-in deduplication

## Integration Ecosystem

The platform integrates extensively with third-party tools through:

**Source Catalog** - ingests data from marketing tools, customer support platforms, payment processors, and business applications

**Destination Catalog** - routes processed data and audiences to advertising platforms, email marketing tools, data warehouses, and business intelligence systems

**Partner Integrations** - provides certified integrations with major technology vendors and consulting partners

**Warehouse-native Amplitude** - offers direct integration with cloud data warehouses for organizations preferring to maintain raw data in their own infrastructure

## Enterprise and Administrative Features

Administrative capabilities include comprehensive account management, billing and usage monitoring, single sign-on integration, and role-based access controls. The platform supports enterprise requirements through audit logging, data governance controls, and compliance features for regulated industries.

The platform's documentation architecture reflects a complete user journey from initial setup through advanced implementation, with dedicated sections for troubleshooting, migration guidance, and experimentation methodology foundations.
