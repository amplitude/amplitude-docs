Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform integrates multiple products including Analytics, Experiment (A/B testing), Session Replay, Customer Data Platform (CDP), and Guides & Surveys into a unified ecosystem for product intelligence and growth optimization.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform operates through an integrated data collection and analysis ecosystem built around several key components:

**Analytics Core** serves as the foundational product providing behavioral analytics through specialized chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Personas, Compass, Impact Analysis, Revenue LTV, Engagement Matrix, Stickiness, and Data Tables. Each chart type offers targeted analysis capabilities for different aspects of user behavior and business metrics.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced statistical analysis, supporting both client-side and server-side experimentation workflows. The product includes comprehensive experiment theory documentation, advanced statistical techniques, troubleshooting guides, and extensive SDK support for programmatic experiment management.

**Session Replay** captures and reconstructs user interactions across web and mobile applications, providing visual insights through session recordings and heatmaps to understand user engagement patterns and identify optimization opportunities.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages the complete data lifecycle through ingestion, transformation, and activation capabilities. It includes source and destination catalogs, audience management, and warehouse-native functionality for organizations requiring data residency control.

## SDK and Integration Ecosystem

The platform provides extensive SDK support across multiple programming languages and platforms with consistent API patterns:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal implementations. Each SDK follows platform-specific best practices while maintaining consistent initialization, event tracking, user identification, and configuration management patterns. SDKs are documented under route structures like `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/{slug}`.

**Experiment SDKs** offer dedicated experimentation capabilities with feature flag evaluation, variant assignment, and statistical analysis integration, documented under `/sdks/experiment-sdks/{slug}`.

**Ampli** provides a code-generation tool that creates type-safe analytics implementations based on tracking plans, ensuring data quality and consistency across development teams while reducing implementation errors.

## API Infrastructure

The platform exposes comprehensive APIs for programmatic access across all product areas:

**Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/{slug}`) provides endpoints for data ingestion, querying, and export capabilities, enabling custom integrations and automated reporting workflows.

**Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/{slug}`) enable programmatic experiment management, variant assignment, and results analysis for automated experimentation workflows.

**Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/{slug}`) supports in-product messaging and feedback collection workflows with targeting and personalization capabilities.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** represent user actions or system occurrences tracked within applications, forming the foundational data unit for all analytics analysis and serving as the basis for behavioral segmentation and funnel analysis.

**Properties** are key-value pairs attached to events providing contextual information about user actions, device characteristics, session details, and custom business metrics that enable detailed behavioral analysis.

**Cohorts** define user segments based on behavioral criteria, demographic attributes, or custom properties, enabling targeted analysis and experimentation with dynamic membership based on real-time user behavior.

**Funnels** track user progression through defined sequences of events, measuring conversion rates and identifying drop-off points in user journeys to optimize critical business processes.

**Retention** measures user return behavior over specified time periods, analyzing product stickiness and engagement patterns to understand long-term user value and product-market fit.

**Experiments** encompass A/B tests, feature flags, and multivariate tests with statistical significance testing, confidence interval analysis, and power calculations for reliable decision-making.

**Variants** represent different versions of features or experiences delivered to users within experiments, with traffic allocation and statistical analysis capabilities.

**Flags** control feature visibility and behavior modification without code deployments, enabling gradual rollouts, emergency shutoffs, and dynamic configuration management.

**Destinations** are external systems receiving data from Amplitude's CDP, including marketing automation tools, data warehouses, business intelligence platforms, and customer engagement systems.

**Sources** represent data ingestion points including SDKs, server-side implementations, third-party integrations, and data imports that feed behavioral and business data into the Amplitude platform.

## Data Management and Privacy

The platform implements comprehensive data governance and privacy controls:

**PII Management** (`/data/pii/{slug}`) provides tools for handling personally identifiable information with privacy controls, data masking, deletion capabilities, and compliance features for GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations.

**Data Tables** offer direct access to underlying event data with SQL-like querying capabilities for advanced analysis, custom reporting, and data exploration beyond standard chart types.

**Audiences** enable behavioral segmentation with real-time updates and cross-platform activation through destination integrations, supporting dynamic user targeting and personalization workflows.

**Warehouse-native Amplitude** allows organizations to run Amplitude analytics directly on their existing data warehouse infrastructure (Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks) while maintaining data residency requirements and existing governance policies.
