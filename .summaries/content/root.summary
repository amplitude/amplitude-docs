Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, run experiments, and optimize digital experiences through data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The platform operates through a multi-layered architecture centered around event tracking, user analytics, and experimentation. The core Analytics product provides behavioral analysis through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, Cohort Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Revenue LTV, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Personas, Data Tables, and Compass. These charts form the foundation for understanding user behavior patterns and measuring product performance.

Amplitude Experiment integrates seamlessly with the Analytics platform, leveraging user data for advanced targeting and cohort-based experimentation. The experimentation workflow includes hypothesis creation, variant configuration, user allocation, and statistical analysis using sequential testing methodologies. Session Replay provides visual context to analytics data by capturing user interactions, while Guides and Surveys enable direct user feedback collection and in-product messaging.

The Customer Data Platform serves as the data backbone, managing data ingestion through Sources, data activation through Destinations, audience creation and management, and warehouse-native capabilities for organizations using their own data infrastructure. The platform supports both real-time and batch data processing with comprehensive data governance features.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Collections**: Organized content groupings that define URL routing, templates, and navigation structure for different product areas and documentation sections.

**Mount Points**: Unique identifiers (UUIDs) that link collections to specific content repositories, enabling modular content management across the platform.

**Navigation Injection**: System for dynamically inserting content into specific navigation contexts (analytics, experiment, data, apis, etc.) to maintain consistent user experience across products.

**Blade Designation**: Product-specific labeling system (e.g., "Amplitude Experiment", "Amplitude Session Replay", "Amplitude Guides and Surveys") for clear product identification within the unified platform.

**Route Patterns**: URL structure definitions using slug-based routing for content organization, supporting hierarchical navigation and SEO optimization.

**Site Propagation**: Multi-language content management system supporting English ('en') and Japanese ('jp') localization with controlled content distribution.

**Preview Targets**: Live preview functionality enabling real-time content review with automatic refresh capabilities for documentation and configuration changes.

**Date Behavior**: Content visibility controls distinguishing between public (past) and private (future) content states for staged releases and content management.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The platform operates as a unified ecosystem where Analytics provides the foundational user behavior data that powers Experiment's targeting capabilities, Session Replay's contextual insights, and Guides and Surveys' audience segmentation. The CDP serves as the central data hub, ingesting data from various sources and distributing insights to destinations across the marketing and product stack.

Integration extends beyond Amplitude's native products through comprehensive API access, including Analytics APIs, Experiment APIs, and Guides and Surveys APIs. The platform supports extensive third-party integrations through Source and Destination catalogs, enabling data flow from customer touchpoints into Amplitude and activation of insights in downstream tools.

Partner integrations expand the ecosystem's capabilities, while PII (Personally Identifiable Information) integrations ensure compliance with data privacy regulations. The platform's warehouse-native approach allows organizations to maintain data sovereignty while leveraging Amplitude's analytical capabilities.

## API Endpoints and Implementation

The platform provides comprehensive SDK support across multiple programming languages and frameworks:

**Analytics SDKs**: Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine implementations with consistent initialization patterns and event tracking capabilities.

**Experiment SDKs**: Dedicated experimentation SDKs supporting both remote and local evaluation modes with automatic exposure tracking and variant assignment.

**Ampli**: Code-generation tool that creates type-safe analytics implementations, ensuring consistent event tracking across development teams and reducing implementation errors.

API endpoints follow RESTful conventions with routes structured as `/apis/{product}/{endpoint}` for programmatic access to platform functionality. The platform supports both real-time and batch API operations with comprehensive authentication and rate limiting.

## Administrative and Operational Framework

The platform includes robust administrative capabilities covering Account Management, Billing and Use monitoring, and Single Sign-On integration for enterprise deployments. Migration tools facilitate transitions from other analytics platforms, while comprehensive FAQ and Troubleshooting resources support implementation and ongoing operations.

The Academy Content system provides structured learning resources, while the multi-language support (including Japanese translation) ensures global accessibility. Legacy chart support maintains backward compatibility while new chart types continue to expand analytical capabilities.

Advanced techniques documentation covers sophisticated use cases, while under-the-hood explanations provide technical depth for implementation teams. The platform's workflow-driven approach ensures consistent processes across experimentation, data management, and analytical workflows.
