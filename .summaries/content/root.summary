Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive data-driven decision making across web and mobile applications.

## Core Product Architecture

Amplitude operates as an integrated analytics ecosystem consisting of four primary product areas:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational data collection and analysis platform, providing event tracking, user segmentation, and behavioral analytics through a comprehensive suite of charting and visualization tools.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities, enabling teams to safely deploy features, run controlled experiments, and measure impact on key metrics.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and reconstructs user interactions across applications, providing visual insights into user behavior through session recordings and heatmaps.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user engagement through targeted messaging, onboarding flows, and feedback collection mechanisms.

## Data Infrastructure and Customer Data Platform (CDP)

The platform operates on a robust Customer Data Platform that centralizes data collection, processing, and distribution. The CDP manages:

**Data Sources** - Ingestion from first-party applications, third-party tools, and external data warehouses through a comprehensive source catalog with pre-built integrations.

**Data Destinations** - Distribution of processed analytics data to downstream systems through an extensive destination catalog supporting marketing tools, data warehouses, and business intelligence platforms.

**Audiences** - Dynamic user segmentation based on behavioral patterns, enabling targeted campaigns and personalized experiences.

**Warehouse-native Amplitude** - Direct integration with cloud data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift) for organizations preferring to maintain data within their existing infrastructure.

## Analytics and Visualization Framework

Amplitude Analytics provides a comprehensive charting library organized into specialized analysis types:

**Behavioral Analysis Charts:**
- **Event Segmentation** - Core event analysis with property breakdowns and filtering
- **Funnel Analysis** - Conversion tracking through multi-step user journeys
- **Retention Analysis** - User return behavior and cohort analysis over time
- **User Sessions** - Session-based analytics and engagement patterns

**Advanced Analytics:**
- **Journeys** - Path analysis showing user navigation flows
- **Compass** - Automated insights and anomaly detection
- **Impact Analysis** - Statistical significance testing for feature releases
- **Experiment Results** - A/B test performance visualization integrated with Amplitude Experiment

**User Understanding:**
- **Personas** - Behavioral clustering and user archetype identification
- **Lifecycle** - User lifecycle stage tracking and progression analysis
- **Engagement Matrix** - Multi-dimensional engagement scoring
- **Stickiness** - Feature adoption and usage frequency analysis

**Revenue Analytics:**
- **Revenue LTV** - Customer lifetime value calculation and forecasting
- **Data Tables** - Flexible data exploration and custom metric calculation

## Software Development Kit (SDK) Ecosystem

Amplitude provides extensive SDK coverage across platforms and programming languages:

**Analytics SDKs:**
- **Browser SDK** - JavaScript implementation for web applications
- **Mobile SDKs** - Native iOS (Swift) and Android (Kotlin/Java) implementations
- **Cross-platform SDKs** - React Native, Flutter, Unity, and Unreal Engine support
- **Server-side SDKs** - Node.js, Python, Java, and Go for backend event tracking

**Experiment SDKs** - Dedicated feature flagging SDKs that integrate with analytics SDKs for seamless experimentation workflows.

**Ampli** - Type-safe, code-generated SDK wrapper that enforces tracking plan compliance and provides IDE autocomplete for event properties.

## API Infrastructure

The platform exposes comprehensive REST APIs for programmatic access:

**Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/`) - Event ingestion, user property management, and data export capabilities with endpoints for batch and real-time data submission.

**Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) - Feature flag management, experiment configuration, and results retrieval for automated experimentation workflows.

**Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) - Programmatic control of in-product messaging campaigns and survey deployment.

## Experimentation and Feature Management

Amplitude Experiment provides a complete experimentation platform with:

**Feature Flag Management** - Boolean flags, multivariate experiments, and gradual rollout capabilities with real-time configuration updates.

**Advanced Techniques** - Statistical methodologies including sequential testing, multi-armed bandits, and holdout groups for sophisticated experiment design.

**Experiment Theory** - Statistical foundations covering power analysis, sample size calculation, and significance testing methodologies.

**Under the Hood** - Technical implementation details for assignment mechanisms, bucketing algorithms, and data consistency guarantees.

**Workflow Integration** - End-to-end experiment lifecycle management from hypothesis formation through results analysis and feature graduation.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** - User actions tracked within applications, forming the foundation of all analytics
**Properties** - Attributes associated with events or users that enable segmentation and filtering
**Cohorts** - User groups defined by shared characteristics or behaviors
**Tracking Plan** - Structured schema defining events, properties, and data governance rules
**Amplitude ID** - Unique identifier assigned to users for cross-platform tracking
**Bucketing** - Algorithm for assigning users to experiment variants
**Holdout Groups** - Control populations excluded from experiments to measure overall platform impact

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** - Multi-organization support with role-based access control, team management, and project isolation.

**Single Sign-On (SSO)** - Enterprise authentication integration supporting SAML, OIDC, and directory services.

**Billing and Usage** - Consumption monitoring, plan management, and usage optimization tools for cost control.

**PII Management** - Comprehensive personally identifiable information handling with data masking, retention policies, and compliance controls for GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations.

## Integration and Partnership Ecosystem

The platform maintains extensive third-party integrations through:

**Source and Destination Catalogs** - Pre-built connectors organized by integration categories (marketing, data warehouses, customer success, etc.) with taxonomy-based organization.

**Partners Program** - Certified integration partners providing specialized implementations and consulting services.

**Migration Tools** - Utilities for transitioning from other analytics platforms with data mapping and historical data preservation.

The platform supports both English and Japanese localization, with comprehensive documentation, troubleshooting guides, and academy content for user education and onboarding across all product areas.
