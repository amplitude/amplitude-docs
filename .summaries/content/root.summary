Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and make data-driven decisions through behavioral analytics, feature experimentation, user engagement tools, and sophisticated data management capabilities.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem consists of four interconnected product pillars that work synergistically:

**Analytics Core** serves as the foundational layer, with Amplitude Analytics providing behavioral event tracking, user segmentation, and comprehensive visualization through specialized chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Revenue LTV, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, and Experiment Results. These charts represent different analytical lenses for examining user behavior patterns and product performance metrics.

**Experimentation Platform** builds upon the analytics foundation through Amplitude Experiment, which provides feature flagging, A/B testing, and multivariate experimentation with advanced statistical analysis. Web Experiment extends these capabilities to browser-based testing, while comprehensive documentation covers Experiment Theory, Advanced Techniques, Under the Hood technical implementation, and complete Workflow guidance for the experimentation lifecycle.

**Data Management** capabilities center around CDP (Customer Data Platform) functionality that orchestrates data ingestion, transformation, and activation. The platform manages extensive catalogs of Sources and Destinations for external system integration, while Audiences enable behavioral segmentation and cross-channel activation. Warehouse-native Amplitude provides direct integration with modern data warehouses.

**User Engagement** tools include Session Replay for capturing and analyzing user interaction recordings, plus Guides and Surveys for in-product user research and onboarding experiences.

**Developer Tools** provide the technical foundation through multi-platform SDKs, Ampli for type-safe analytics implementation with code generation, and comprehensive APIs for programmatic access to analytics data, experiment management, and platform administration.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Analytics Concepts:**
- **Events** - Discrete user actions tracked within applications (page views, clicks, purchases, custom behaviors)
- **Properties** - Attributes associated with events (event properties) or users (user properties) that provide contextual information
- **Segments** - Dynamically filtered subsets of users or events based on specific behavioral or demographic criteria
- **Cohorts** - Static or dynamic groups of users defined by shared characteristics, behaviors, or time-based criteria
- **Funnels** - Sequential step-by-step analysis of user progression through defined conversion paths
- **Retention** - Longitudinal analysis measuring user return behavior across specified time periods
- **LTV (Lifetime Value)** - Revenue attribution modeling and predictive analytics for user value

**Experimentation Terminology:**
- **Feature Flags** - Boolean or multivariate toggles controlling feature availability and behavior
- **Variants** - Different versions or configurations of features being tested in experiments
- **Allocation** - Percentage distribution of users assigned to control and treatment groups
- **Statistical Significance** - Confidence threshold for determining experiment result validity
- **Lift** - Percentage improvement or change in key performance metrics

**Data Management Framework:**
- **Sources** - Systems and applications that send behavioral data to Amplitude
- **Destinations** - External platforms and tools receiving processed data from Amplitude
- **Transformations** - Data processing rules and logic applied during ingestion and activation
- **Schemas** - Structured definitions specifying event formats, property types, and validation rules
- **Taxonomy** - Organized hierarchical classification system for events, properties, and user attributes

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Instrumentation** - Code implementation process for tracking events and user interactions
- **SDK (Software Development Kit)** - Platform-specific libraries enabling data collection and feature flag evaluation
- **API Endpoints** - RESTful interfaces providing programmatic access to platform functionality
- **Mount Points** - Content management system organizational structure for documentation hierarchy

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates into modern data and marketing technology stacks through multiple integration layers:

**Data Integration Architecture** provides extensive connectivity through Source Catalogs with pre-built connectors for tools like Segment, mParticle, Salesforce, and Shopify, while Destination Catalogs enable data activation across advertising platforms, CRMs, and marketing automation systems. Warehouse Connectors support direct integration with Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, and Databricks, complemented by real-time streaming capabilities for immediate data processing.

**Developer Ecosystem Support** includes comprehensive multi-platform SDKs covering web, mobile, server-side, and gaming environments. Ampli provides type-safe implementation with automated code generation, while REST APIs enable custom integrations and programmatic platform management. Webhook support facilitates real-time event streaming and notification systems.

**Enterprise Integration Features** encompass Single Sign-On (SSO) with enterprise identity providers, SCIM 2.0 for automated user provisioning, granular role-based access control, data governance tools including PII management and compliance features, plus multi-site support for global organizations with data residency requirements.

**Analytics Workflow Integration** supports Portfolio Management for multi-product organizations, cross-project analysis capabilities, behavioral cohorts that synchronize with marketing platforms, automated insights with anomaly detection, and custom dashboard creation with reporting automation.
