Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics platform that provides organizations with deep insights into user behavior through event tracking, experimentation, and data management capabilities. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Product Architecture and Relationships

The platform is structured around several core product areas that work together to provide end-to-end analytics capabilities:

**Analytics Core** serves as the foundation, offering 16+ specialized chart types organized into four use case categories: Know Your Users (Event Segmentation, User Sessions, Data Tables), Convert Your Users (Funnel Analysis, Journeys), Retain Your Users (Retention Analysis, Stickiness, Lifecycle, Engagement Matrix), and Monetize (Revenue LTV). Advanced analytics capabilities include Personas clustering, Compass behavioral threshold analysis, and Impact Analysis.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with dedicated experiment results visualization, advanced techniques documentation, experiment theory guidance, and comprehensive troubleshooting resources. The platform includes specialized workflow documentation and "under the hood" technical implementation details.

**Data Management** encompasses the Customer Data Platform (CDP) with source and destination catalogs, audience management, warehouse-native capabilities, and PII integration handling. The platform supports comprehensive data governance and privacy compliance.

**Developer Tools** include extensive SDK support across platforms (Android, iOS, Browser, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal, Node.js, Java, Python, Go), the Ampli type-safe analytics wrapper, and comprehensive API documentation for both Analytics and Experiment products.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events Module**: Core component for event selection and configuration, supporting default Amplitude events, wildcard search with glob operators, and custom event grouping with OR logic.

**Segmentation Module**: Enables user segment creation using user properties, behavioral cohorts, and filter operators (is, contains, starts with, set operators, glob match) with complex OR/AND clause logic.

**Behavioral Cohorts**: User groups defined by specific action sequences or property combinations that can be reused across charts and experiments.

**Array Operators**: Specialized filtering for array-type event properties including set operations and containment logic.

**Cart Analysis**: Advanced e-commerce feature for analyzing object arrays through property splitting with cross-property, parallel, item match, and collection match filtering.

**Query Time Sampling**: Performance optimization analyzing 10% random user samples with inverse sampling result extrapolation.

**Mount Points**: Technical identifiers (UUIDs) that link collection configurations to specific content repositories for documentation organization.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The platform operates as an integrated ecosystem where each component enhances the others:

**Cross-Product Data Flow**: Analytics events feed into Experiment for statistical analysis, Session Replay provides behavioral context for analytics insights, and Guides and Surveys collect qualitative data that complements quantitative analytics.

**Developer Integration**: SDKs provide consistent instrumentation across platforms, with Ampli ensuring type safety and proper event tracking. APIs enable custom integrations and automated workflows.

**Data Infrastructure**: The CDP centralizes data collection and distribution, while warehouse-native capabilities enable direct data warehouse analysis. Source and destination catalogs provide extensive third-party integrations.

**Administrative Framework**: Comprehensive admin tools cover account management, billing and usage monitoring, single sign-on integration, and role-based access control across all products.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Analytics API**: Provides programmatic access to chart data and dashboard management with endpoints under `/apis/analytics/`

**Experiment APIs**: Enable feature flag management and experiment configuration via `/apis/experiment/`

**Guides and Surveys API**: Supports survey deployment and response collection through `/apis/guides-and-surveys/`

**SDK Routes**: Platform-specific documentation accessible via `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/` for analytics SDKs and `/sdks/experiment-sdks/` for experiment implementations

**Chart-Specific Endpoints**: Individual chart types accessible via `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/` routes including funnel-analysis, retention-analysis, event-segmentation, and others

The platform includes comprehensive migration documentation, FAQ and troubleshooting resources, partner integrations, and multi-language support including Japanese localization. Academy content provides structured learning paths, while the partner ecosystem extends platform capabilities through certified integrations.
