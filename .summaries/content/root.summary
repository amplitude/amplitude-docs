Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables product teams to understand user behavior, optimize experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products spanning analytics, experimentation, customer data management, and user engagement tools.

## High-Level Product Overview

Amplitude's core offering centers around behavioral analytics with advanced chart types for understanding user journeys, retention patterns, and conversion funnels. The platform extends into feature experimentation through Amplitude Experiment for A/B testing and feature flagging, customer data platform capabilities for unified data management, and specialized tools like Session Replay for user experience analysis and Guides & Surveys for in-product engagement.

The platform serves both technical and non-technical users through comprehensive SDKs for developers, visual interfaces for analysts and product managers, and APIs for custom integrations. Multi-language support includes Japanese localization, indicating global enterprise adoption.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

**Analytics Foundation**: The analytics core provides event tracking, user segmentation, and behavioral analysis through specialized chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, and Revenue LTV. Legacy Charts maintain backward compatibility for existing implementations.

**Experimentation Layer**: Amplitude Experiment operates as both a standalone product and integrated analytics component, featuring server-side feature flags, client-side A/B testing, and Web Experimentation for visual editing without code changes. Advanced Techniques, Experiment Theory, and Under the Hood collections provide implementation guidance and statistical foundations.

**Data Infrastructure**: The Customer Data Platform (CDP) unifies data collection through Sources, data activation through Destinations, Audience creation and management, and Warehouse-native capabilities for existing data infrastructure integration. PII Integrations handle privacy-compliant data processing.

**Developer Ecosystem**: Comprehensive SDK coverage includes Analytics SDKs (Android, iOS, Browser, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Java, Python, Go, Unity, Unreal), Experiment SDKs for feature flagging, and Ampli for type-safe analytics implementation. APIs provide programmatic access to Analytics, Experiment, and Guides & Surveys functionality.

**User Experience Tools**: Session Replay captures user interactions for qualitative analysis, while Guides & Surveys enable in-product messaging, onboarding flows, and feedback collection directly within applications.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events**: User actions tracked within applications, forming the foundation for all analytics and experimentation analysis.

**Properties**: Attributes associated with events (event properties) or users (user properties) that enable segmentation and targeting.

**Cohorts/Audiences**: User segments defined by behavioral patterns, properties, or engagement criteria, used for analysis and experiment targeting.

**Experiments**: A/B tests or feature flags that modify user experiences, with variants representing different treatment conditions.

**Flags**: Feature toggles that control functionality rollout and can be dynamically adjusted without code deployments.

**Charts**: Specialized analytics visualizations optimized for specific analysis types (funnels, retention, segmentation, etc.).

**Instrumentation**: The process of implementing event tracking and SDK integration within applications.

**Amplitude ID**: Unique user identifier that enables cross-device and cross-session user tracking.

**Bucketing**: The process of assigning users to experiment variants based on targeting criteria and traffic allocation.

**Impressions**: Tracking events that record user exposure to experiments or feature flags for analysis and billing.

## Broader Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates extensively with the modern data and marketing technology stack through multiple integration patterns:

**Data Sources**: Native connectors for popular platforms through the Source Catalog, enabling data ingestion from existing tools and databases.

**Data Destinations**: The Destination Catalog provides activation pathways to marketing automation, advertising platforms, data warehouses, and business intelligence tools.

**Partner Ecosystem**: Strategic partnerships extend platform capabilities through pre-built integrations and joint solutions.

**Enterprise Infrastructure**: Single Sign-On (SSO) support, advanced account management, billing controls, and administrative features enable enterprise deployment and governance.

**Migration Support**: Dedicated migration tools and documentation facilitate transitions from other analytics platforms while preserving historical data and existing implementations.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Analytics API**: Programmatic access to event data, user properties, cohort definitions, and chart configurations at `/apis/analytics/{endpoint}`.

**Experiment APIs**: Feature flag evaluation, experiment configuration, and results analysis through `/apis/experiment/{endpoint}`.

**Guides & Surveys API**: In-product messaging and survey management via `/apis/guides-and-surveys/{endpoint}`.

**SDK Endpoints**: Platform-specific implementation paths like `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/{endpoint}` for instrumentation guidance and configuration.

**Web Experiment Script**: Dynamic JavaScript delivery from `cdn.amplitude.com` with CDN caching and anti-flicker capabilities for client-side experimentation.

The platform emphasizes developer experience through comprehensive documentation, troubleshooting guides, FAQ resources, and Academy Content for user education. Administrative features cover account management, billing oversight, and usage monitoring to support enterprise deployment and optimization.
