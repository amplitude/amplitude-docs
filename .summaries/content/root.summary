# Amplitude Product Suite

## Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and digital optimization platform that helps businesses understand user behavior, track product performance, and make data-driven decisions. The platform provides tools for collecting, analyzing, and activating user data to improve product experiences.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

The Amplitude platform consists of four integrated core products:

1. **Amplitude Analytics** - The flagship product for analyzing user behavior through various visualization tools including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Paths, Session Replay, and Behavioral Cohorts. Analytics provides both Dashboards for monitoring key metrics and Notebooks for collaborative analysis.

2. **Amplitude Experiment** - A feature experimentation and A/B testing platform supporting both client-side (Web Experiment) and server-side experimentation with impact analysis capabilities. Experiment integrates with Analytics to measure the effects of experiments on key metrics.

3. **Amplitude Data** - The data management and governance layer that handles data collection (Sources), integrations (Source Catalog and Destination Catalog), PII management, and includes a Customer Data Platform (CDP) for audience management and activation.

4. **Amplitude SDKs** - Platform-specific development kits for data collection across various environments including Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, and Ampli (Amplitude's type-safe wrapper SDK).

The platform architecture follows a logical flow:
- Data Collection Layer (SDKs and APIs)
- Data Processing Layer (validation and enrichment)
- Analysis Layer (Analytics tools)
- Activation Layer (Experiment and CDP)

Products are offered across different tiers: Plus (basic), Growth (advanced), and Enterprise (complete).

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### User and Event Tracking
- **Event**: A discrete user action tracked in the platform
- **User Property**: Attributes associated with individual users
- **Group Property**: Attributes associated with accounts or organizations
- **Session**: Collection of events grouped by time and user activity
- **Cohort**: Group of users sharing common characteristics or behaviors

### Analytics Concepts
- **Historical Count**: Tracking specific instances of user actions
- **Channel Classifiers**: Categorization of traffic sources
- **Attribution Models**: Methods for crediting marketing channels for conversions
- **Behavioral Offset**: Segmenting audiences based on behaviors across time periods

### Content Organization
- **Spaces**: Collaborative areas for organizing and sharing content
- **Personal Space/Workspace**: Individual user's area for saved analyses
- **Official Content**: Designated source-of-truth dashboards and charts
- **Templates**: Reusable dashboard configurations with customizable parameters

## Technical Integration

### Data Collection Methods
- **SDKs**: Client-side instrumentation for various platforms
- **Server-side APIs**: Identify API, HTTP API for server-side tracking
- **Integrations**: Segment and other third-party data sources
- **Group Identify API**: For creating and updating group properties

### Key API Endpoints
- **HTTP V2 API** (`api2.amplitude.com`): Primary endpoint for sending events
- **Identify API**: For updating user properties
- **Group Identify API**: For creating and updating group properties
- **Experiment APIs**: For feature flag and experiment management

### SDK Configuration Examples
```javascript
// JavaScript SDK with domain proxy
amplitude.init('API_KEY', null, {
    serverUrl: 'https://your-domain.com/amplitude/'
});
```

```java
// Android SDK with domain proxy
Amplitude.getInstance()
    .setServerUrl("https://your-domain.com/amplitude/");
```

### Warehouse-Native Integration
Amplitude supports direct data loading from data warehouses using the Data Warehouse Import feature via S3 or GCS buckets, eliminating the need for API keys.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates with the broader product ecosystem through:

1. **Data Sources**: Integrations with platforms like Segment, mParticle, and direct connections to data warehouses
2. **Data Destinations**: Export capabilities to BI tools, marketing platforms, and data warehouses
3. **Authentication Systems**: SSO integration with enterprise identity providers
4. **Development Workflows**: SDK integration with various development frameworks

The platform serves as a central hub for product data, connecting with both upstream data sources and downstream activation platforms to create a complete data lifecycle.

## Administration

Amplitude provides comprehensive tools for managing organizations including Single Sign-On for enterprise authentication, billing and usage tracking, and user permissions and access controls.

The documentation is multilingual, supporting both English and Japanese, with specialized collections for Japanese translations.
