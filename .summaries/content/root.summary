# Amplitude Analytics Platform

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics platform that provides product teams with tools to understand user behavior, run experiments, and optimize product experiences. The platform centers around event-based analytics, enabling organizations to track user interactions, analyze behavioral patterns, and make data-driven product decisions through a suite of integrated tools spanning analytics, experimentation, customer data management, and user engagement.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The platform operates through several interconnected product layers that work together to provide end-to-end analytics capabilities:

**Core Analytics Engine** serves as the foundation, built around event tracking and user behavior analysis. This includes the main Analytics product with specialized chart types (Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, Cohort Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Revenue LTV, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Data Tables, and Compass), each designed for specific analytical use cases from conversion optimization to user lifecycle management.

**Experimentation Platform (Amplitude Experiment)** integrates directly with the analytics engine, providing feature flagging, A/B testing, and advanced experimentation capabilities. The platform includes experiment theory, workflow management, advanced techniques, troubleshooting tools, and specialized experiment results charts that leverage the same underlying event data as the analytics platform.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation through source and destination catalogs, audience management, and warehouse-native capabilities. This layer ensures data consistency across all platform components while enabling data export to external systems.

**Specialized Products** extend the core platform:
- **Session Replay** provides qualitative insights to complement quantitative analytics
- **Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user engagement and feedback collection
- **Web Experiment** offers browser-based experimentation capabilities

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Events and Properties**: The fundamental data model centers on events (user actions) with associated event properties (action-specific attributes) and user properties (persistent user characteristics). Events are stored in the `$events` table with VARIANT data types supporting flexible schema evolution.

**User Identification System**: Multi-layered user tracking through `user_id` (business logic), `amplitude_id` (platform-specific), and merged user handling for identity resolution across devices and sessions.

**Charts and Analysis Types**: Specialized analytical interfaces including:
- **Event Segmentation**: Basic event counting and property analysis
- **Funnel Analysis**: Conversion flow optimization
- **Retention Analysis**: User return behavior measurement
- **Cohort Analysis**: User group behavior over time
- **Journeys**: User path analysis through product experiences
- **Lifecycle**: User engagement state transitions
- **Personas**: User clustering based on behavioral patterns

**Experimentation Terminology**:
- **Feature Flags**: Dynamic configuration management
- **Variants**: Different experiment experiences
- **Allocation**: User assignment to experiment groups
- **Statistical Significance**: Experiment result confidence measurement

**Data Infrastructure**:
- **Sources**: Data ingestion points from various platforms
- **Destinations**: Data export endpoints for activation
- **Audiences**: User segments for targeting and analysis
- **Warehouse-native**: Direct data warehouse integration capabilities

## SDK and API Ecosystem

The platform provides comprehensive instrumentation through multiple SDKs supporting various development environments:

**Analytics SDKs**: Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal SDKs enable event tracking across web, mobile, server-side, and gaming platforms. Each SDK follows consistent patterns for event tracking, user identification, and property management while accommodating platform-specific requirements.

**Experiment SDKs**: Dedicated SDKs for feature flag evaluation and experiment participation, designed to work alongside analytics SDKs for complete experimentation workflows.

**Ampli**: Code generation tool that creates type-safe tracking implementations based on defined tracking plans, ensuring data quality and consistency across development teams.

**API Access**: RESTful APIs for Analytics, Experiment, and Guides and Surveys enable programmatic access to platform capabilities, supporting custom integrations and automated workflows.

**Key API Endpoints**:
- `/apis/analytics/` - Event ingestion and data retrieval
- `/apis/experiment/` - Feature flag management and evaluation
- `/apis/guides-and-surveys/` - In-product engagement management

## Platform Integration and Data Flow

The platform operates on a unified data model where events flow from SDKs through the ingestion layer into the analytics engine, making data immediately available across all product components. This architecture ensures that experiment results, user segments, and analytical insights all operate on the same underlying event data.

**Data Processing**: 30-minute data loading cycles balance real-time access with query performance, while supporting both streaming and batch data processing patterns.

**Cross-Product Integration**: Experiments can be analyzed using standard analytics charts, audiences created in the CDP can be used for experiment targeting, and session replay data provides context for analytical insights.

**Enterprise Features**: Advanced capabilities including single sign-on, account management, billing controls, PII handling, partner integrations, and warehouse-native deployment options support enterprise-scale implementations.

**Geographic and Compliance**: Multi-region support with specific considerations for EU data handling, Japanese localization, and various compliance requirements for different markets and use cases.

The platform's modular architecture allows organizations to adopt individual components while maintaining the option to expand into the full suite, with consistent data models and user experiences across all products.
