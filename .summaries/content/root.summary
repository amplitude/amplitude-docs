Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment (feature flagging and A/B testing), Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Core Product Architecture

### Analytics Platform
The analytics foundation centers on event-based tracking with sophisticated chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Revenue LTV, and Data Tables. Charts can be organized into dashboards and support various visualization modes. The platform includes specialized analytics features like Compass for metric monitoring and legacy chart support for backward compatibility.

### Experimentation Suite (Amplitude Experiment)
The experimentation platform provides feature flagging, A/B testing, and advanced statistical analysis capabilities. It includes experiment theory documentation, advanced techniques, workflow management, troubleshooting resources, and "under the hood" technical details. The platform supports experiment results analysis through dedicated chart types and integrates with various third-party tools.

### Customer Data Platform
The CDP manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation through source and destination catalogs. It includes audience management, data governance features, warehouse-native capabilities, and PII (Personally Identifiable Information) handling integrations.

### Additional Products
- **Session Replay**: Provides qualitative user experience analysis through session recordings
- **Guides and Surveys**: Enables in-product user engagement and feedback collection
- **Web Experiment**: Specialized web-based experimentation capabilities

## SDK and API Ecosystem

### Analytics SDKs
The platform supports comprehensive instrumentation through multiple SDKs:
- **Mobile**: Android SDK, iOS SDK, Flutter SDK, React Native SDK
- **Web**: Browser SDK, JavaScript implementations
- **Server-side**: Node.js SDK, Python SDK, Java SDK, Go SDK
- **Gaming**: Unity SDK, Unreal SDK
- **Ampli**: Type-safe analytics wrapper for consistent implementation

### API Infrastructure
Multiple API endpoints serve different purposes:
- **Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/`): Core analytics data access
- **Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`): Feature flag and experiment management
- **Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`): In-product messaging control

### Experiment SDKs
Dedicated SDKs for feature flagging and experimentation (`/sdks/experiment-sdks/`) enable real-time feature delivery and experiment participation across platforms.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Collections**: Content organization system using YAML configuration files that define routing, templates, and navigation structure

**Mount Points**: UUID-based content mounting system that links collections to specific content hierarchies

**Navigation Injection**: System for associating content with navigation categories (analytics, experiment, data, apis, etc.)

**Blade Attribution**: Product-specific labeling system (e.g., "Amplitude Experiment", "Amplitude Session Replay", "Amplitude Guides and Surveys")

**Route Patterns**: URL structure definitions using slug-based routing with hierarchical organization

**Sites and Propagation**: Multi-site content management with language-specific routing (en/jp) and propagation controls

**Preview Targets**: Content preview system with permalink generation and refresh capabilities

**Date Behavior**: Content visibility controls with past/future publication states

## Content Management Architecture

### Hierarchical Organization
Content is organized through a sophisticated collection system with parent-child relationships. The `pages.yaml` collection serves as the root structure, while specialized collections handle specific product areas. Collections can have mounted content (via UUID references) or direct content management.

### Multi-language Support
The platform supports internationalization with English (`en`) and Japanese (`jp`) sites. The `japanese_translation.yaml` collection manages localized content with specific routing and navigation injection.

### Navigation System
Content is categorized into navigation groups:
- **get_started**: Onboarding and migration content
- **analytics/analytics_sdks**: Core analytics features and SDKs
- **experiment/experiment_sdks**: Experimentation tools and SDKs
- **data**: CDP, sources, destinations, and data management
- **apis**: API documentation and references
- **admin**: Account management, billing, SSO configuration
- **partners**: Third-party integrations and partnerships

### Content Lifecycle Management
Collections support revision control (mostly disabled), date-based publishing, preview functionality, and template-based rendering. The system includes specialized collections for troubleshooting, FAQs, and academy content.

## Integration Ecosystem

### Administrative Features
The platform includes comprehensive administrative capabilities through dedicated collections for account management (`/admin/account-management/`), billing and usage (`/admin/billing-use/`), and single sign-on configuration (`/admin/single-sign-on/`).

### Partner Ecosystem
A dedicated partners collection (`/partners/`) manages third-party integrations and marketplace relationships, supporting the broader ecosystem of tools and services that integrate with Amplitude.

### Migration and Onboarding
Specialized collections handle user onboarding (`get-started`), platform migration (`migration`), and educational content (`academy_content`), ensuring smooth user adoption and platform transitions.

The platform's architecture demonstrates a mature, enterprise-grade analytics and experimentation solution with comprehensive SDK support, flexible content management, and extensive integration capabilities across the modern data stack.
