Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, optimize conversion, and run feature experiments. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Core Product Architecture

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine with 15+ specialized chart types organized around four key use cases: knowing users (Event Segmentation, Data Tables, User Sessions), converting users (Funnel Analysis, Journeys), retaining users (Retention Analysis, Stickiness, Lifecycle), and advanced analytics (Personas, Impact Analysis, Compass). Each chart type routes to `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/{slug}` and supports comprehensive event analysis, user segmentation, and behavioral insights.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities through multiple collection routes including `/feature-experiment/{slug}`, with specialized sections for advanced techniques, experiment theory, workflow management, troubleshooting, and under-the-hood technical details. The platform includes dedicated experiment result analysis charts and integrates with the broader analytics ecosystem.

**Amplitude Session Replay** enables user session recording and analysis through the `/session-replay/{slug}` route, providing visual insights into user interactions and behavior patterns.

**Guides and Surveys** offers in-product messaging and feedback collection capabilities, accessible via `/guides-and-surveys/{section}/{slug}` with its own dedicated API endpoints.

## SDK and Integration Ecosystem

The platform provides extensive SDK coverage across multiple programming languages and frameworks:

**Analytics SDKs** include dedicated collections for Android, iOS, Browser (JavaScript), React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine, all routing through `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/{slug}`. Each SDK maintains platform-specific documentation and implementation guides.

**Experiment SDKs** provide feature flag and experimentation capabilities across platforms via `/sdks/experiment-sdks/{slug}`.

**Ampli** serves as a type-safe analytics wrapper accessible through `/sdks/ampli/{slug}`, providing strongly-typed event tracking across supported platforms.

**Framework Integrations** support popular development frameworks through `/sdks/frameworks/{slug}`.

## Data Management and Customer Data Platform

The **CDP (Customer Data Platform)** manages data flow through source and destination catalogs:

**Source Catalog** (`/data/source-catalog/{slug}`) provides pre-built integrations for data ingestion with taxonomy-based categorization through `integration_category`.

**Destination Catalog** (`/data/destination-catalog/{slug}`) offers data export and activation capabilities to downstream tools and platforms.

**Audiences** (`/data/audiences/{slug}`) enables behavioral segmentation and user cohort creation for targeted analysis and activation.

**Warehouse-native Amplitude** (`/data/warehouse-native/{slug}`) provides direct integration with data warehouses for analysis without data movement.

## API Infrastructure

The platform exposes comprehensive API access through multiple endpoints:

**Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/{slug}`) provides programmatic access to chart data and analytics functionality.

**Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/{slug}`) enable feature flag management and experiment configuration.

**Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/{slug}`) supports in-product messaging automation.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** (`/admin/account-management/{slug}`) provides user and organization administration capabilities.

**Billing and Use** (`/admin/billing-use/{slug}`) offers usage monitoring and billing management.

**Single Sign-on** (`/admin/single-sign-on/{slug}`) enables enterprise authentication integration.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Concepts

**Collections** represent content groupings with specific routing patterns, template configurations, and navigation injection. Most collections use the `default` template with `layout` layout and include preview targets for content management.

**Mount Points** (identified by UUIDs like `ba956cb4-9ae1-456a-b122-984b491048f6`) link collections to specific content repositories or data sources.

**Navigation Injection** (`inject.nav_title`) determines how content appears in site navigation, with values like `analytics`, `experiment`, `data`, `apis`, and `developers`.

**Site Propagation** controls multi-site content distribution, with English (`en`) and Japanese (`jp`) site support.

**Date Behavior** manages content visibility with `past: public` and `future: private` settings for scheduled publishing.

**Blade Injection** adds product-specific branding (e.g., "Amplitude Experiment", "Amplitude Session Replay") to relevant sections.

## Specialized Features and Tools

**Agents** (`/docs/agents/{slug}`) provides AI-powered analytics assistance and automated insights.

**Partners** (`/partners/{slug}`) showcases integration partnerships and third-party tool connections.

**Migration** (`/migration/{slug}`) offers guidance for transitioning from other analytics platforms.

**PII Integrations** (`/data/pii/{slug}`) handles personally identifiable information management and compliance.

**Legacy Charts** maintains backward compatibility for deprecated visualization types.

The platform supports multi-language documentation with dedicated Japanese translations (`sites: jp`) and comprehensive FAQ and troubleshooting resources. The content management system uses Statamic with YAML-based collection configuration, enabling flexible content organization and automated preview generation across all product areas.
