Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with advanced tools for product analytics, feature experimentation, customer data management, and user engagement optimization. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products designed to help companies understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven decision making.

## Core Product Architecture

The Amplitude ecosystem is built around several primary product areas that work together to provide end-to-end analytics and experimentation capabilities:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, offering sophisticated charting and analysis tools including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Cohort Analysis (Lifecycle), Revenue LTV, Stickiness analysis, Impact Analysis, Journeys mapping, Personas creation, Data Tables, Engagement Matrix, and Compass strategic planning tools. Each chart type is accessible through dedicated routes like `/analytics/charts/event-segmentation/` and `/analytics/charts/funnel-analysis/`.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides comprehensive A/B testing and feature flagging capabilities, encompassing experiment design, statistical analysis, advanced techniques, experiment theory, workflow management, troubleshooting, and results analysis. The platform includes both traditional experimentation tools and Experiment Results for analyzing tests run on external platforms.

**Amplitude CDP (Customer Data Platform)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation through source catalogs, destination catalogs, audiences, data tables, warehouse-native capabilities, and PII integrations. This creates a unified data foundation accessible via routes like `/data/source-catalog/` and `/data/destination-catalog/`.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user session recordings to provide qualitative insights into user behavior and experience optimization opportunities.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user engagement through targeted messaging, onboarding flows, and feedback collection mechanisms.

## SDK and Integration Ecosystem

The platform provides extensive instrumentation capabilities through multiple SDKs and integration points:

**Analytics SDKs** support all major platforms including Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine, with dedicated documentation routes like `/sdks/analytics/browser/` and `/sdks/analytics/android/`.

**Experiment SDKs** provide feature flagging and experimentation capabilities across development environments, accessible through `/sdks/experiment-sdks/`.

**Ampli** offers a code-generation tool for type-safe analytics implementation, ensuring consistent event tracking across applications via `/sdks/ampli/`.

**APIs** provide programmatic access to Analytics, Experiment, and Guides and Surveys functionality through RESTful endpoints documented under `/apis/analytics/`, `/apis/experiment/`, and `/apis/guides-and-surveys/`.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** are user actions tracked within applications, forming the foundation of all analytics analysis. Events can have properties that provide additional context and enable sophisticated segmentation.

**Cohorts** represent groups of users defined by shared characteristics or behaviors, used for targeted analysis and audience creation.

**Funnels** track multi-step user journeys to identify conversion bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.

**Retention** measures user return behavior over specified time periods, crucial for understanding product stickiness and long-term engagement.

**Segments** allow filtering of data based on user properties, event properties, or behavioral criteria to enable targeted analysis.

**Exposure Events** in experimentation define when users enter experiment variants, serving as the foundation for statistical analysis.

**Conversion Windows** specify time periods for measuring experiment outcomes and attribution.

**CUPED (Controlled-experiment Using Pre-Experiment Data)** is a statistical technique for reducing variance in experiment results by leveraging pre-experiment user behavior.

## Advanced Analytics Capabilities

The platform provides sophisticated statistical and analytical capabilities:

**Formula Metrics** enable custom calculations using functions like UNIQUES, TOTALS, PROPSUM, PROPAVG, CONVERSIONRATE, and REVENUETOTAL for tailored business metric creation.

**Sequential Testing** allows for continuous monitoring of experiment results with proper statistical controls to prevent false positives.

**Confidence Intervals** provide statistical ranges for metric performance across experiment variants.

**Behavioral Cohorts** group users based on actions taken, enabling dynamic audience creation and analysis.

**Cross-Platform Attribution** tracks user journeys across multiple touchpoints and devices.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

The platform includes comprehensive administrative capabilities through `/admin/` routes:

**Account Management** provides user provisioning, role management, and organizational controls.

**Single Sign-On** enables enterprise authentication integration for secure access management.

**Billing and Usage** monitoring helps organizations track consumption and optimize costs.

**Data Governance** tools ensure compliance with privacy regulations and data handling requirements.

## Content and Support Infrastructure

The platform maintains extensive educational and support resources:

**Academy Content** provides structured learning materials for platform mastery.

**FAQ and Troubleshooting** sections offer self-service support for common issues and questions.

**Migration** documentation assists organizations transitioning from other analytics platforms.

**Partners** integration guides facilitate connections with third-party tools and services.

**Multi-language Support** includes Japanese translations for international accessibility.

## Data Management and Privacy

The platform emphasizes robust data handling through:

**PII Integrations** that manage personally identifiable information with appropriate privacy controls.

**Warehouse-Native** capabilities that enable analysis directly within customer data warehouses.

**Source and Destination Catalogs** that facilitate data integration with hundreds of third-party tools and platforms.

**Taxonomy Management** through integration categories that organize and classify data sources and destinations.

The platform's architecture supports both real-time and batch data processing, with configurable retention policies, privacy controls, and data governance features that enable organizations to maintain compliance while gaining deep insights into user behavior and product performance.
