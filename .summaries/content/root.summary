# Amplitude Documentation Product Overview

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics platform that helps businesses understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth. The platform consists of several integrated products:

- **Analytics** - Core platform for tracking and analyzing user behavior through various chart types and visualizations
- **Experiment** - A/B testing and feature experimentation platform for measuring impact of product changes
- **CDP** (Customer Data Platform) - Data management and audience segmentation for personalized experiences
- **Session Replay** - Visual session recording and playback to understand user interactions
- **Data Management** - Tools for handling data sources, destinations, and PII management

Amplitude enables product teams to track user journeys, analyze behavioral patterns, run experiments, create targeted audiences, and integrate data across their tech stack to make data-driven product decisions.

## Product Relationships and Structure

The Amplitude platform consists of interconnected products that work together:

1. **Analytics Platform** (core offering)
   - Various chart types (Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis)
   - Data Tables for raw event exploration
   - User Sessions analysis
   - Compass for product analytics insights

2. **Implementation Layer**
   - Platform-specific SDKs (iOS, Android, Web, React Native, Flutter)
   - Ampli (type-safe wrapper for SDKs)
   - Instrumentation best practices

3. **Experimentation Framework**
   - Experiment SDKs for client-side implementation
   - Experiment APIs for server-side implementation
   - Statistical methodology and experiment design
   - Workflow guides for setting up and analyzing experiments

4. **Data Infrastructure**
   - Sources for data ingestion from various platforms
   - Destinations for exporting data to other tools
   - Audiences for user segmentation
   - PII management for data privacy compliance

5. **Administration and Governance**
   - Account management and user permissions
   - Billing and usage monitoring
   - Single Sign-On integration
   - Data governance controls

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event** - A discrete user action or system occurrence tracked in Amplitude (e.g., "Button Click", "Purchase Completed")
- **Property** - Metadata attached to events or users providing additional context (e.g., "price", "item_name")
- **User** - An individual using a product, identified by a User ID or Amplitude ID
- **Session** - A period of continuous user activity, defined by configurable timeout settings
- **Funnel** - A sequence of events representing a user journey or conversion path
- **Cohort** - A group of users who share common characteristics or behaviors
- **Segment** - A subset of users or events based on specific criteria for analysis
- **Experiment** - A controlled test comparing variations of a feature to measure impact
- **Variant** - A specific version of a feature in an experiment (e.g., control vs. treatment)
- **Source** - An origin point for data coming into Amplitude (e.g., mobile app, website)
- **Destination** - A system receiving data exported from Amplitude (e.g., data warehouse, marketing tool)
- **Audience** - A defined group of users for targeting or analysis based on behaviors or attributes
- **Taxonomy** - The organizational structure of events and properties for consistent tracking

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's products form an integrated ecosystem:

1. **Data Collection and Processing**
   - SDKs collect user behavior data from applications
   - Data flows through the CDP for processing and enrichment
   - Identity resolution connects user actions across devices and sessions
   - Taxonomy management ensures consistent data structure

2. **Analysis and Insights**
   - Analytics provides visualization and insights from the collected data
   - Charts and dashboards reveal patterns in user behavior
   - Behavioral cohorts identify valuable user segments
   - Session Replay provides visual context for quantitative data

3. **Action and Optimization**
   - Experiment uses analytics data for targeting and measurement
   - Audiences created in CDP can be activated in Experiment or exported to marketing tools
   - Insights from Analytics inform experimentation hypotheses
   - Results from experiments feed back into Analytics for ongoing monitoring

4. **External Integrations**
   - Source integrations bring data from third-party tools into Amplitude
   - Destination integrations export Amplitude data to external systems
   - Warehouse-native architecture supports direct data warehouse connections
   - APIs enable programmatic access to Amplitude functionality

## API Endpoints and Implementation Details

### SDK Implementation

**Web SDK Initialization:**
```javascript
amplitude.init('API_KEY', {
  logLevel: 3,
  defaultTracking: true,
  trackingOptions: {
    ipAddress: false
  }
});
```

**Event Tracking:**
```javascript
amplitude.track('Button Clicked', {
  buttonColor: 'blue',
  buttonText: 'Submit',
  pageLocation: 'checkout'
});
```

**User Identification:**
```javascript
amplitude.identify(new amplitude.Identify()
  .set('email', 'user@example.com')
  .set('plan_type', 'premium')
  .setOnce('initial_referrer', 'google'));
```

### Experiment Implementation

**Client-side Experiment:**
```javascript
// Fetch variant for a user
const variant = await experiment.fetch({
  user_id: 'user-123',
  flag_key: 'new-checkout-flow'
});

if (variant === 'treatment') {
  // Show new checkout flow
} else {
  // Show control checkout flow
}
```

**Server-side Experiment:**
```javascript
const experimentClient = ExperimentClient.initialize({
  apiKey: 'server-api-key',
  serverUrl: 'https://api.lab.amplitude.com'
});

const result = await experimentClient.evaluate('user-123', ['feature-flag-key']);
```
