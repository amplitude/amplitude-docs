Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven decision making. The platform consists of several interconnected products: Analytics for behavioral analysis, Experiment for feature flagging and A/B testing, Data for governance and instrumentation, Session Replay for user experience insights, and Guides & Surveys for in-product engagement.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

**Analytics Core**
Amplitude Analytics serves as the central hub, offering multiple chart types for behavioral analysis including Event Segmentation (trend analysis), Funnel Analysis (conversion tracking), Retention Analysis (user stickiness), User Sessions (engagement patterns), Journeys (path analysis), and specialized charts like Compass (KPI monitoring), Personas (user clustering), and Revenue LTV (monetization analysis). The platform supports real-time data processing with advanced segmentation capabilities, cohort analysis, and cross-project portfolio analysis.

**Experimentation Platform**
Amplitude Experiment provides feature flagging, A/B testing, and multivariate testing capabilities with both client-side and server-side evaluation. The platform includes advanced techniques like mutual exclusion groups, holdout groups, and statistical analysis with multiple testing corrections. Web Experiment offers specialized browser-based testing with anti-flicker technology and visual editors for non-technical users.

**Data Management Layer**
Amplitude Data functions as the governance backbone, providing tracking plan management, schema validation, code generation through Ampli, and data quality monitoring. The platform supports comprehensive data ingestion through SDKs (Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal, Node.js, Python, Java, Go), APIs, and third-party integrations.

**User Experience Tools**
Session Replay captures and reconstructs user sessions for qualitative analysis, while Guides & Surveys enables in-product messaging, onboarding flows, and feedback collection with targeting based on behavioral data and experiment participation.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Analytics Concepts**
- **Events**: Discrete user actions or system occurrences (e.g., "Button Clicked", "Page Viewed")
- **Properties**: Attributes describing events (event properties) or users (user properties)
- **Segments**: Filtered subsets of users or events based on specific criteria
- **Cohorts**: Groups of users sharing common characteristics or behaviors
- **Funnels**: Sequential event flows measuring conversion rates
- **Retention**: Measurement of user return behavior over time periods

**Experimentation Terminology**
- **Feature Flags**: Boolean toggles controlling feature visibility
- **Variants**: Different versions of features being tested
- **Allocation**: Percentage of users exposed to experiments
- **Mutual Exclusion**: Preventing user overlap between conflicting experiments
- **Holdout Groups**: Control populations excluded from all experiments
- **Statistical Significance**: Confidence level in experiment results

**Data Infrastructure Terms**
- **Tracking Plans**: Structured schemas defining events and properties
- **Ampli**: Type-safe code generation tool for consistent instrumentation
- **Sources**: Data input methods (SDKs, APIs, integrations)
- **Destinations**: External platforms receiving Amplitude data
- **Transformations**: Data modification rules applied at query time
- **Autocapture**: Automatic collection of user interactions

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)**
Amplitude functions as a behavioral CDP with real-time audience creation, cross-platform identity resolution, and activation through 300+ destination integrations. The platform supports both streaming and batch data synchronization with marketing tools, ad networks, and business intelligence platforms.

**Modern Data Stack Integration**
The platform integrates with cloud data warehouses (Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery) through bidirectional sync, supporting both data import and export. Warehouse-native Amplitude enables analysis of data stored in customer warehouses while maintaining Amplitude's analytics capabilities.

**Developer Ecosystem**
Comprehensive SDK coverage across web, mobile, server, and gaming platforms with consistent APIs and automatic updates. The platform provides REST APIs for analytics queries, user management, experiment configuration, and data ingestion with rate limiting and authentication.

**Enterprise Features**
Advanced capabilities include Single Sign-On (SSO) integration, role-based access controls, data governance through Data Access Control (DAC), audit logging, and compliance features for GDPR/CCPA requirements.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Analytics APIs**
- **Dashboard REST API**: `/api/2/` endpoints for querying chart data, managing dashboards, and accessing behavioral cohorts
- **Export API**: Bulk data export with `/export/` endpoints supporting various formats
- **User Profile API**: Individual user lookup and property management
- **Behavioral Cohorts API**: Programmatic cohort creation and management

**Experiment APIs**
- **Management API**: Experiment configuration, flag management, and results retrieval
- **Evaluation API**: Real-time feature flag evaluation for server-side implementations
- **Local Evaluation**: Client-side SDKs with cached flag configurations

**Data Ingestion**
- **HTTP V2 API**: Primary real-time event ingestion endpoint
- **Batch API**: Bulk event upload for historical data import
- **Identify API**: User property updates and identity management

**SDK Implementation Patterns**
Common initialization parameters include `apiKey`, `userId`, `deviceId`, tracking options for privacy compliance, and configuration for session management, batching behavior, and offline storage.

**Command Line Tools**
- **Ampli CLI**: `ampli pull`, `ampli push`, `ampli status` for tracking plan management
- **Data validation**: `ampli verify` for implementation verification

The platform emphasizes privacy-first design with configurable data retention, user deletion capabilities, IP address anonymization, and granular tracking controls. Enterprise deployments support custom domains, dedicated infrastructure, and advanced security configurations.
