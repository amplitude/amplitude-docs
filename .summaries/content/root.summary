Amplitude is a comprehensive behavioral analytics and experimentation platform that enables businesses to track user behavior, analyze product usage patterns, conduct A/B tests, and activate insights across their technology ecosystem. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP) with extensive integration capabilities.

## Core Product Architecture and Relationships

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational product, providing behavioral event tracking, user segmentation, and advanced analytics capabilities through multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Cohort Analysis, and Revenue LTV. The analytics engine processes user events through various SDKs and provides insights through specialized visualization tools.

**Amplitude Experiment** integrates with the analytics platform to provide feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities, leveraging behavioral data for experiment targeting and results analysis. The experiment platform includes advanced techniques, statistical theory components, and comprehensive result analysis tools.

**Session Replay** captures and analyzes user interaction recordings to provide qualitative insights that complement quantitative behavioral data from the analytics platform.

**Guides and Surveys** enables in-product messaging and user feedback collection, utilizing behavioral triggers and audience segmentation from the core analytics platform.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** orchestrates data flow between Amplitude and external systems through source and destination catalogs, audience management, and data transformation capabilities.

## Analytics Chart Types and Visualization Framework

The analytics platform provides specialized chart types for different analytical use cases:

**Event Segmentation** analyzes user actions and properties across segments with filtering and grouping capabilities. **Funnel Analysis** tracks conversion rates through multi-step user journeys with time-based analysis. **Retention Analysis** measures user return behavior over time periods with cohort-based segmentation. **User Sessions** provides session-based analytics including duration, depth, and engagement metrics.

**Lifecycle Analysis** categorizes users into New, Current, Resurrected, and Dormant segments based on activity patterns. **Stickiness Analysis** measures user engagement frequency and habit formation. **Personas** creates behavioral user segments based on event patterns and properties.

**Compass** provides automated insights and anomaly detection across key metrics. **Data Tables** offers raw event exploration with SQL-like filtering capabilities. **Journeys** visualizes user paths and behavioral flows between events.

**Impact Analysis** measures the effect of product changes on key metrics. **Engagement Matrix** correlates different user behaviors and feature usage patterns. **Revenue LTV** analyzes customer lifetime value and revenue attribution.

## SDK Architecture and Instrumentation

Amplitude provides comprehensive SDK coverage across platforms and languages:

**Client-Side SDKs** include Browser SDK (JavaScript/TypeScript), Android SDK (Java/Kotlin), iOS SDK (Swift/Objective-C), React Native SDK, Flutter SDK, Unity SDK, and Unreal SDK for game development.

**Server-Side SDKs** encompass Node.js SDK, Python SDK, Java SDK, and Go SDK for backend event tracking and user property management.

**Ampli** serves as a type-safe wrapper that generates strongly-typed tracking libraries from predefined event schemas, ensuring consistent instrumentation across platforms and reducing implementation errors.

All SDKs support core functionality including event tracking, user identification, user properties, group analytics, and offline event queuing with automatic retry mechanisms.

## API Ecosystem and Integration Framework

**Analytics APIs** provide programmatic access to event ingestion through the HTTP V2 API, user profile management via the Identify API, behavioral cohort exports through the Behavioral Cohorts API, and raw data access through various export APIs.

**Experiment APIs** enable feature flag evaluation, experiment assignment, and results retrieval for programmatic experiment management and custom integration scenarios.

**Guides and Surveys API** supports in-product messaging campaign management and survey response collection through RESTful endpoints.

All APIs utilize consistent authentication patterns, rate limiting, and error handling mechanisms with comprehensive documentation for integration scenarios.

## Data Management and Customer Data Platform

**Source Catalog** provides pre-built integrations for importing data from external platforms including marketing tools, customer support systems, payment processors, and other analytics platforms. Sources support both event streaming and batch data import patterns.

**Destination Catalog** enables data activation by exporting behavioral data, user segments, and analytics insights to over 100 third-party platforms including marketing automation tools, customer engagement platforms, advertising networks, and data warehouses.

**Audiences** functionality creates behavioral segments based on user actions and properties, supporting real-time and scheduled audience updates with cross-platform synchronization capabilities.

**Warehouse-Native Amplitude** allows direct analysis of data stored in cloud data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift) without data movement, providing analytics capabilities on existing data infrastructure.

## Experiment Platform and Statistical Framework

**Experiment Theory** encompasses statistical methodologies including hypothesis testing, statistical significance calculations, confidence intervals, and power analysis for reliable experiment results.

**Advanced Techniques** include sequential testing, multi-armed bandits, stratified sampling, and advanced statistical methods for complex experimentation scenarios.

**Experiment Results** analysis provides comprehensive metrics including conversion rates, statistical significance, confidence intervals, and segment-based analysis with automated insights and recommendations.

**Experiment SDKs** enable feature flag evaluation and experiment assignment across all supported platforms with consistent APIs and local evaluation capabilities for performance optimization.

**Under the Hood** documentation explains the technical implementation of experiment assignment, statistical calculations, and data processing pipelines.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** provides organization-level controls including user permissions, team management, project organization, and access control mechanisms.

**Single Sign-On (SSO)** supports enterprise authentication through SAML, OAuth, and other identity provider integrations for secure user access management.

**Billing and Use** tracking provides usage monitoring, plan management, and cost optimization tools for enterprise deployments.

**PII Integrations** ensure privacy compliance through data anonymization, pseudonymization, and secure handling of personally identifiable information across all platform components.
