Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with integrated tools for product analytics, feature experimentation, customer data management, and in-product user engagement. The platform serves as a unified ecosystem for understanding user behavior, optimizing product experiences, and driving business growth through data-driven decision making.

## Core Product Architecture

The Amplitude platform consists of several interconnected products that work together to provide end-to-end analytics and optimization capabilities:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational behavioral analytics product, offering specialized chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Compass, Personas, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, Revenue LTV, Data Tables, and Experiment Results. Each chart type provides dedicated analysis capabilities accessible through routes like `/analytics/charts/funnel-analysis/` and `/analytics/charts/retention-analysis/`.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities through `/feature-experiment/` routes, with specialized sections for Advanced Techniques (`/feature-experiment/advanced-techniques/`), Experiment Theory (`/feature-experiment/experiment-theory/`), Under the Hood (`/feature-experiment/under-the-hood/`), Workflow (`/feature-experiment/workflow/`), and Troubleshooting (`/feature-experiment/troubleshooting/`).

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user sessions for qualitative insights, accessible through `/session-replay/` routes with dedicated product branding.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user experiences through `/guides-and-surveys/` routes, providing contextual onboarding and feedback collection capabilities.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages comprehensive data operations through `/data/` routes, including Sources (`/data/sources/`), Audiences (`/data/audiences/`), Source Catalog (`/data/source-catalog/`), Destination Catalog (`/data/destination-catalog/`), and Warehouse-native Amplitude (`/data/warehouse-native/`).

## SDK and API Ecosystem

The platform provides extensive SDK support across multiple programming languages and platforms:

**Analytics SDKs** include dedicated implementations for Browser (`/sdks/analytics/browser/`), Android (`/sdks/analytics/android/`), iOS (`/sdks/analytics/ios/`), React Native (`/sdks/analytics/react-native/`), Flutter (`/sdks/analytics/flutter/`), Node.js (`/sdks/analytics/node/`), Python (`/sdks/analytics-sdks/python/`), Java (`/sdks/analytics/java/`), Go (`/sdks/analytics/go/`), Unity (`/sdks/analytics/unity/`), and Unreal (`/sdks/analytics/unreal/`).

**Experiment SDKs** are available through `/sdks/experiment-sdks/` routes for implementing feature flags and experiments across different platforms.

**Ampli** provides a code-generation tool accessible through `/sdks/ampli/` routes for type-safe analytics implementation.

**API Infrastructure** includes Analytics API (`/apis/analytics/`), Experiment APIs (`/apis/experiment/`), and Guides and Surveys API (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) for programmatic access to platform functionality.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Collections** represent the primary organizational structure for documentation, with each collection corresponding to a specific product area or feature set. Collections use YAML configuration files defining routing patterns, navigation injection, and content organization.

**Mount Points** are unique identifiers (UUIDs) that link collections to specific content repositories, enabling modular content management across the platform.

**Navigation Injection** uses the `inject.nav_title` property to organize content within the documentation hierarchy, with standardized values including `analytics`, `experiment`, `data`, `apis`, `analytics_sdks`, `experiment_sdks`, and `admin`.

**Blade Identification** uses the `inject.blade` property to specify product branding, with values like "Amplitude Experiment", "Amplitude Session Replay", and "Amplitude Guides and Surveys".

**Route Patterns** define URL structures using dynamic variables like `{slug}`, `{permalink}`, `{{section}}`, and `{parent_uri}` for flexible content routing.

**Date Behavior** controls content visibility with `past: public` and `future: private` settings for managing content publication schedules.

**Site Propagation** manages multi-language support through `sites` arrays (en, jp) and `propagate` boolean flags for content distribution across localized versions.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** (`/admin/account-management/`) provides organizational controls for user access, permissions, and team management.

**Billing and Use** (`/admin/billing-use/`) offers usage monitoring, quota management, and subscription administration capabilities.

**Single Sign-on** (`/admin/single-sign-on/`) enables enterprise authentication integration for secure organizational access.

**PII Integrations** (`/data/pii/`) provide privacy-compliant data handling mechanisms for personally identifiable information management.

**Migration** (`/migration/`) supports platform transitions, data migration workflows, and legacy system integration.

## Integration and Partnership Ecosystem

**Partners** (`/partners/`) documentation covers third-party integrations, marketplace partnerships, and ecosystem collaboration opportunities within the Amplitude platform.

**Source and Destination Catalogs** utilize taxonomy-based organization through `integration_category` classifications for comprehensive data pipeline management and third-party tool connectivity.

**Web Experiment** (`/web-experiment/`) provides specialized experimentation capabilities optimized for web-based implementations and browser environments.

**Legacy Charts** (`/analytics/charts/legacy-charts/`) maintain backward compatibility for deprecated visualization types while supporting migration to newer chart formats.

## Content Management and Localization

**Japanese Translation** (`/japanese_translation.yaml`) provides localized content through dedicated site configuration with `sites: [jp]` designation and specialized navigation injection for international markets.

**Academy Content** serves educational resources through dedicated collection management, providing structured learning paths and certification materials.

**FAQ and Troubleshooting** (`/faq/`) centralizes support documentation across all product areas, offering searchable solutions and common issue resolution.

**Sections** (`/sections.yaml`) provide top-level navigation structure with `route: '/{slug}'` patterns and table-of-contents management through `inject.hide_toc: true` configuration.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The platform architecture demonstrates a sophisticated content management system built around collection-based organization, where each product area maintains dedicated routing, navigation, and branding while integrating into a cohesive documentation ecosystem. The extensive SDK support across multiple programming languages and platforms, comprehensive API availability, and robust administrative features position Amplitude as an enterprise-grade analytics platform capable of supporting complex organizational requirements.

The modular architecture allows organizations to adopt individual components (Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, CDP) independently or as an integrated suite, with seamless data flow between products. The warehouse-native capabilities enable organizations to leverage existing data infrastructure while benefiting from Amplitude's analytics and experimentation capabilities, creating a flexible deployment model that adapts to diverse technical architectures and organizational needs.
