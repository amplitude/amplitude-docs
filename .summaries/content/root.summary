Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, manage data, run experiments, and monitor user sessions. The platform consists of four core products that work together to deliver end-to-end product intelligence capabilities.

## Core Product Suite

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational product for behavioral analytics, enabling organizations to track, measure, and analyze user interactions across digital properties. It provides insights into user journeys, conversion funnels, and product performance metrics through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Compass, Data Tables, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, Lifecycle, Personas, Stickiness, Revenue LTV, and Experiment Results.

**Amplitude Data** functions as the data management layer, handling data ingestion, transformation, and governance through Sources, Audiences, and warehouse-native capabilities. It includes comprehensive source and destination catalogs for third-party integrations, PII management, and CDP functionality.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities through advanced techniques, experiment theory, workflow management, and troubleshooting tools. It enables teams to safely deploy features, run controlled experiments, and make data-driven product decisions.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and reconstructs user sessions, providing visual insights into user behavior and helping identify usability issues and optimization opportunities.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** provides in-app messaging and feedback collection capabilities to engage users and gather insights directly within applications.

## SDK and API Architecture

The platform operates through extensive SDK coverage across multiple platforms and languages:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal implementations, providing comprehensive instrumentation capabilities across web, mobile, server-side, and gaming platforms.

**Experiment SDKs** offer dedicated experimentation functionality separate from analytics tracking.

**Ampli** provides a code-generation tool that creates type-safe analytics implementations based on tracking plans.

The **API layer** encompasses Analytics APIs, Experiment APIs, and Guides and Surveys APIs, enabling programmatic access to platform functionality, data exports, and administrative operations.

## Key Nomenclature and Concepts

The platform employs specific terminology around data collection and analysis:

- **Collections**: Organizational structures that group related documentation and functionality by product area
- **Mount Points**: Unique identifiers (UUIDs) that link collections to specific content repositories
- **Route Patterns**: URL structures that define how content is organized and accessed (e.g., `/analytics/charts/{slug}`, `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/{slug}`)
- **Navigation Injection**: System for categorizing content within the documentation hierarchy using `nav_title` parameters
- **Blade Identification**: Product-specific labeling (e.g., "Amplitude Experiment", "Amplitude Session Replay") for feature attribution
- **Site Propagation**: Multi-language support with English (`en`) and Japanese (`jp`) localization
- **Preview Targets**: Live preview functionality for documentation updates
- **Date Behavior**: Content visibility controls with past content public and future content private by default

## Product Integration Patterns

The documentation reveals several integration patterns:

**Hierarchical Organization**: Content is structured in parent-child relationships, with main product areas (Analytics, Data, Experiment, Session Replay) containing specialized sub-collections for charts, SDKs, APIs, and features.

**Cross-Product Functionality**: Experiment Results charts within Analytics demonstrate integration between Amplitude Experiment and Analytics products.

**Multi-Platform Support**: Comprehensive SDK coverage ensures consistent functionality across web, mobile, server-side, and gaming environments.

**Administrative Structure**: Dedicated collections for account management, billing, single sign-on, and general administration provide enterprise-grade operational capabilities.

## Documentation Infrastructure

The system utilizes a sophisticated content management approach with:

- **Template Standardization**: Consistent `default` templates with `layout` specifications across collections
- **Revision Control**: Disabled revisions (`revisions: false`) indicating a streamlined publishing workflow
- **Structured Navigation**: Hierarchical organization with root-level sections and nested subcategories
- **Internationalization**: Multi-site support with content propagation controls
- **Legacy Support**: Dedicated collections for legacy charts and migration documentation
- **Partner Ecosystem**: Dedicated partner documentation section for third-party integrations

## Ecosystem Positioning

Amplitude positions itself as a central hub in the modern data stack, with extensive integration capabilities through source and destination catalogs, warehouse-native functionality, and comprehensive API access. The platform enables bidirectional data flow, allowing organizations to enrich Amplitude data with external sources while exporting insights to downstream systems. The combination of quantitative analytics, qualitative session replay, controlled experimentation, and user engagement tools creates a complete product intelligence ecosystem.
