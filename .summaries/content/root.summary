# Amplitude Analytics Platform

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics platform that provides product intelligence through event tracking, experimentation, customer data management, and user engagement tools. The platform serves product teams, developers, and data analysts with integrated solutions for understanding user behavior, running experiments, and driving product growth.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem consists of four primary product areas that work together to provide end-to-end analytics capabilities:

**Analytics Core** forms the foundation with event tracking, user identification, and behavioral analysis. This includes the Analytics SDKs (Android, iOS, Browser, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Flutter, React Native, Unity, Unreal), the Analytics API, and the Ampli type-safe wrapper system. The analytics engine powers multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Personas, Compass, Stickiness, Revenue LTV, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, and Data Tables.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities, with dedicated Experiment SDKs, APIs, and specialized analytics through Experiment Results charts. The experimentation platform includes advanced statistical techniques, experiment theory documentation, and comprehensive troubleshooting resources.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation through Sources, Destinations, Audiences, and warehouse-native capabilities. The CDP includes extensive integration catalogs for both data sources and destinations, with specialized PII handling and partner integrations.

**Engagement Tools** encompass Session Replay for user experience analysis, and Guides and Surveys (with dedicated APIs) for in-product user engagement and feedback collection.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Event Tracking and Analytics:**
- **Events**: User actions tracked via `track()` (modern SDKs) or `logEvent()` (legacy SDKs) methods
- **Identify Operations**: User property management through `set`, `setOnce`, `unset`, `add`, `append`, `prepend` operations
- **Revenue Tracking**: Monetization analytics using Revenue objects with `productId`, `price`, `quantity` properties
- **Group Analytics**: Organization-level tracking via `groupIdentify()` and `setGroup()` operations
- **Autocapture**: Automated tracking of sessions, screen views, element interactions, and user frustration signals

**Experimentation:**
- **Feature Flags**: Dynamic configuration management for feature rollouts
- **A/B Testing**: Statistical experimentation with variant assignment and results analysis
- **Advanced Techniques**: Sophisticated experimental methodologies and statistical approaches
- **Experiment Theory**: Statistical foundations and best practices for experimentation

**Data Management:**
- **Sources**: Data ingestion points from various platforms and applications
- **Destinations**: Data activation endpoints for marketing, analytics, and operational tools
- **Audiences**: User segmentation and cohort management for targeted campaigns
- **Warehouse-native**: Direct data warehouse integration for enterprise analytics workflows

**Configuration and Infrastructure:**
- **ServerZone**: EU data residency configuration for GDPR compliance
- **Batching**: Event upload optimization through configurable thresholds and intervals
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible system for custom analytics implementations
- **COPPA Control**: Child privacy compliance mechanisms
- **TrackingOptions**: Granular data collection controls

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates with the broader analytics and marketing technology ecosystem through multiple integration points:

**Development Integration**: The platform supports modern development workflows through framework integrations (React, Angular, Vue.js), comprehensive SDK coverage across mobile and web platforms, and the Ampli code generation system that creates type-safe APIs from tracking plans defined in Amplitude Data.

**Enterprise Infrastructure**: Warehouse-native capabilities enable direct integration with Snowflake, BigQuery, and Redshift. The platform supports single sign-on (SSO), advanced account management, and billing controls for enterprise deployments.

**Marketing and Growth Stack**: The destination catalog includes integrations with major marketing platforms, CRMs, and operational tools. Audiences can be synced to advertising platforms, email marketing tools, and customer success platforms for activation.

**Partner Ecosystem**: Amplitude maintains partnerships with complementary analytics, experimentation, and customer data tools, enabling customers to build comprehensive product intelligence stacks.
