Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and customer data platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and activate customer data across their technology ecosystem. The platform consists of four core products: Analytics for behavioral analysis and insights, Experiment for feature flagging and A/B testing, Session Replay for user experience optimization, and CDP (Customer Data Platform) for data orchestration and activation.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem is built around several interconnected product areas that work together to provide end-to-end customer analytics and activation capabilities:

**Analytics** serves as the foundational behavioral analytics engine, offering multiple specialized chart types for different analytical use cases. Event Segmentation provides core event analysis and user behavior tracking, while Funnel Analysis enables conversion optimization through step-by-step user journey analysis. Retention Analysis measures user engagement over time, and Cohort analysis tracks user groups. Advanced visualization tools include Compass for metric monitoring, Journeys for path analysis, Personas for user clustering, Lifecycle for user state tracking, Stickiness for engagement measurement, Impact Analysis for feature impact assessment, Revenue LTV for monetization analysis, User Sessions for session-based insights, and Data Tables for flexible data exploration.

**Experiment** (Amplitude Experiment) provides comprehensive feature management and experimentation capabilities, including feature flagging, A/B testing, and advanced experimental design. The platform supports sophisticated experiment theory, advanced techniques for complex testing scenarios, and detailed experiment results analysis. It integrates closely with analytics data to provide statistically rigorous experimentation workflows.

**Session Replay** (Amplitude Session Replay) captures and analyzes actual user sessions, providing visual insights into user behavior, friction points, and optimization opportunities through recorded user interactions.

**CDP (Customer Data Platform)** orchestrates data collection, processing, and activation across the customer lifecycle. It includes Sources for data ingestion, Audiences for intelligent segmentation using behavioral and predictive cohorts, and Destinations for data activation across external platforms.

**Guides and Surveys** (Amplitude Guides and Surveys) enables in-product user engagement through targeted messaging, onboarding flows, and feedback collection.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events**: Discrete user actions tracked within products, forming the foundation of all behavioral analysis.

**Properties**: Attributes associated with events or users that provide context and enable segmentation.

**Cohorts**: User segments based on shared characteristics or behaviors, used for analysis and targeting.

**Behavioral Cohorts**: Segments created from actual user actions and engagement patterns.

**Predictive Cohorts**: Machine learning-generated segments identifying users likely to perform specific actions.

**Computations**: Derived metrics that transform raw event data into meaningful business insights.

**Feature Flags**: Configuration switches that control feature visibility and behavior in applications.

**Variants**: Different versions of features or experiences tested in experiments.

**Statistical Significance**: Confidence level that experiment results represent true differences rather than random variation.

**Lift**: Percentage improvement in conversion or key metrics from experiments.

**Instrumentation**: The process of implementing tracking code to capture user behavior data.

**Ampli**: Amplitude's type-safe analytics wrapper that ensures consistent event tracking across platforms.

**AutoML**: Automated machine learning capabilities for generating predictions without manual model development.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude operates as a comprehensive customer intelligence platform that integrates across the entire product development and marketing lifecycle. The platform connects behavioral analytics insights with practical business execution through its CDP capabilities, enabling closed-loop optimization where analytical discoveries directly drive customer experience improvements.

The ecosystem supports multi-site deployment with internationalization capabilities (including Japanese localization), extensive third-party integrations through source and destination catalogs, and partner ecosystem connectivity. The platform provides warehouse-native capabilities for organizations with existing data infrastructure, enabling analysis directly within customer data warehouses.

Administrative capabilities include comprehensive account management, billing and usage monitoring, single sign-on integration, and PII (Personally Identifiable Information) handling for privacy compliance. The platform supports enterprise-grade security and compliance requirements while maintaining ease of use for individual contributors.

## API Endpoints and Technical Integration

Amplitude provides extensive programmatic access through multiple API interfaces:

**Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/`) enables programmatic access to behavioral data, chart configurations, and analytical insights.

**Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) provide feature flag management, experiment configuration, and results retrieval capabilities.

**Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) enables programmatic control of in-product messaging and feedback collection.

**Profile API** and **Cohorts API** (within CDP) provide granular access to user profiles and audience segments for real-time personalization and targeting.

The platform supports comprehensive SDK coverage across all major development platforms including Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine. Each SDK provides platform-optimized event tracking, user identification, and feature flag evaluation capabilities.

**Ampli** serves as a code-generation tool that creates type-safe analytics implementations, ensuring consistent event tracking across platforms and reducing implementation errors.

The platform includes extensive troubleshooting resources, migration guides for transitioning from other analytics platforms, and comprehensive developer documentation to support implementation across diverse technical environments. Advanced users can leverage warehouse-native capabilities to perform Amplitude analysis directly within their existing data infrastructure, providing flexibility for organizations with complex data architectures.
