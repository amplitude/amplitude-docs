# Amplitude Analytics Platform

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools for tracking user behavior, analyzing product performance, and conducting feature experiments. The platform consists of multiple integrated products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Product Relationships and Architecture

### Core Analytics Platform
The **Analytics** product serves as the foundation, providing event tracking, user behavior analysis, and business intelligence through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, Cohort Analysis (Lifecycle), User Sessions, Journeys, Personas, Stickiness, Revenue LTV, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Data Tables, and Compass. These charts are organized under the unified analytics interface with specialized visualization capabilities for different analytical use cases.

### Experimentation Suite
**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities, integrating closely with the analytics platform for experiment result analysis. The experimentation suite includes advanced techniques, experiment theory, workflow management, troubleshooting tools, and "under the hood" technical documentation. Experiment results are analyzed through dedicated chart types within the analytics platform.

### User Experience Products
**Session Replay** captures and analyzes user session recordings for qualitative insights, while **Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user engagement through targeted messaging and feedback collection. **Web Experiment** provides browser-based experimentation capabilities for web applications.

### Data Infrastructure
The **Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and routing through source and destination catalogs. The platform supports warehouse-native implementations, audience management, and PII (Personally Identifiable Information) handling with dedicated integration patterns.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Analytics Terminology
- **Event Segmentation** - Analysis of user actions broken down by properties and segments
- **Funnel Analysis** - Conversion tracking through sequential user actions
- **Retention Analysis** - User return behavior measurement over time periods
- **Lifecycle/Cohort Analysis** - User engagement patterns across different lifecycle stages
- **Stickiness** - Frequency of user engagement within specific time windows
- **Revenue LTV** - Customer lifetime value and revenue attribution analysis
- **Personas** - User clustering and behavioral segmentation
- **Journeys** - User path analysis and navigation flow tracking
- **Compass** - Metric monitoring and alerting system
- **Impact Analysis** - Statistical significance testing for feature releases

### Experimentation Concepts
- **Feature Flags** - Dynamic configuration controls for feature rollouts
- **A/B Testing** - Statistical comparison of different product variants
- **Experiment Results** - Statistical analysis and visualization of experiment outcomes
- **Advanced Techniques** - Sophisticated experimentation methodologies
- **Workflow** - End-to-end experiment lifecycle management

### Data Management
- **Source Catalog** - Pre-built integrations for data ingestion from external systems
- **Destination Catalog** - Pre-built integrations for data export to external platforms
- **Audiences** - User segments created from behavioral data for activation
- **Data Tables** - Raw event data exploration and custom query capabilities
- **Warehouse-native** - Direct integration with customer data warehouses

### SDK and Implementation
- **Analytics SDKs** - Client libraries for event tracking across platforms (Android, iOS, Browser, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, Unreal)
- **Experiment SDKs** - Client libraries for feature flag evaluation and experiment participation
- **Ampli** - Code generation tool for type-safe event tracking implementation
- **Instrumentation** - Implementation guidance and best practices for event tracking

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

### Multi-Product Platform
The platform operates as an integrated suite where Analytics provides the foundational event tracking and analysis capabilities, Experiment leverages this data for statistical testing, Session Replay adds qualitative context, and Guides and Surveys enable direct user engagement. The CDP ensures data consistency and routing across all products.

### API Infrastructure
The platform exposes comprehensive APIs including:
- **Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/`) - Event ingestion and data export
- **Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) - Feature flag management and evaluation
- **Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) - Campaign management and response collection

### Administrative Features
Enterprise capabilities include **Account Management** for user and organization administration, **Single Sign-on** integration, **Billing and Use** monitoring, and comprehensive **FAQ and Troubleshooting** resources. The platform supports multi-site deployment with internationalization (Japanese translation available).

### Developer Ecosystem
**Partners** integration enables third-party tool connectivity, while the **SDK Catalog** provides comprehensive client library support across web, mobile, server-side, and gaming platforms. **Migration** tools facilitate transitions between different analytics platforms or SDK versions.

## API Endpoints and Implementation Patterns

### Route Structure
The platform uses hierarchical routing patterns:
- `/analytics/{slug}` - Core analytics features and charts
- `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/{slug}` - Specific chart type documentation
- `/feature-experiment/{slug}` - Experimentation features
- `/data/{slug}` - CDP and data management features
- `/sdks/{platform}/{slug}` - Platform-specific SDK documentation
- `/apis/{product}/{slug}` - API documentation by product
- `/admin/{slug}` - Administrative features

### SDK Integration Patterns
Each SDK collection follows consistent patterns with platform-specific routes:
- `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/{slug}` - Analytics SDK documentation
- `/sdks/experiment-sdks/{slug}` - Experiment SDK documentation
- `/sdks/ampli/{slug}` - Ampli code generation tool documentation

### Content Management
The platform uses a sophisticated content management system with:
- **Mount points** - Linking collections to specific content trees
- **Navigation injection** - Consistent navigation context across related content
- **Preview targets** - Content preview capabilities for documentation updates
- **Taxonomies** - Categorization system for integration catalogs
- **Multi-site support** - English and Japanese localization
- **Date behavior controls** - Content publication and visibility management

The platform serves as a comprehensive product analytics ecosystem enabling organizations to track user behavior, conduct experiments, analyze performance, and optimize user experiences through integrated data collection, analysis, and activation capabilities.
