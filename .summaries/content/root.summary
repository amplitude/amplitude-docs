Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize conversions, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Product Architecture and Relationships

**Core Analytics Platform**: The foundation centers around event tracking and user behavior analysis through 16+ specialized chart types organized into four primary use cases: Know Your Users (Event Segmentation, User Sessions, Data Tables), Convert Your Users (Funnel Analysis, Journeys, Experiment Results), Retain Your Users (Retention Analysis, Stickiness, Lifecycle), and Monetize (Revenue LTV). Advanced analytics include Personas clustering, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, and Compass for behavioral threshold identification.

**Experimentation Suite**: Amplitude Experiment provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced techniques, experiment theory, workflow management, and troubleshooting tools. The platform includes dedicated Experiment Results charts within Analytics and specialized APIs for experiment management.

**Session Intelligence**: Session Replay captures and analyzes user session recordings, while User Sessions charts provide session-based behavioral analysis within the Analytics platform.

**User Engagement Tools**: Guides and Surveys enables in-product messaging and feedback collection with dedicated APIs for programmatic management.

**Data Infrastructure**: The CDP handles data ingestion through source catalogs, data transformation, audience creation, and activation through destination catalogs. Warehouse-native Amplitude extends analytics capabilities directly to data warehouses.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events Module**: Core component for event selection supporting default Amplitude events (Top Global Events, Any Active Event, New User), wildcard search with glob operators, and custom event grouping with OR logic.

**Segmentation Module**: Handles user categorization with support for active users, new users, behavioral cohorts, and complex filtering using user properties with inline cohort creation via "+ Performed" functionality.

**Array Operators**: Comprehensive filtering system including basic operators (is, is not, contains, does not contain) and set operators (set is, set is not, set contains, set does not contain) for array data structures.

**Group-by Functionality**: Enables event categorization with automatic result pruning (100 values for single group-by, 500 for double group-by) and intelligent ordering by top activity.

**Cart Analysis**: E-commerce analytics using object arrays with property splitting, supporting cross-property and parallel filtering semantics for shopping cart behavior analysis.

**Ampli**: Type-safe analytics wrapper that generates strongly-typed tracking libraries for consistent event instrumentation across platforms.

**Behavioral Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments based on event performance and user properties that automatically update based on defined criteria.

**Feature Flags**: Dynamic configuration system enabling controlled feature rollouts and A/B testing through Amplitude Experiment.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The platform operates as an integrated ecosystem where data flows seamlessly between components:

**Data Layer**: Sources (SDK Catalog, Source Catalog) → CDP → Analytics/Experiment → Destinations (Destination Catalog). The platform supports 10+ SDKs including Android, iOS, Browser, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal.

**API Infrastructure**: Comprehensive API coverage including Analytics API (`/apis/analytics/`), Experiment APIs (`/apis/experiment/`), and Guides and Surveys API (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) enabling programmatic access to all platform capabilities.

**Cross-Product Features**: Experiment Results charts integrate A/B testing data into Analytics dashboards, Session Replay data enhances user journey analysis, and CDP audiences power both Analytics segmentation and Experiment targeting.

**Enterprise Administration**: Centralized account management (`/admin/account-management/`), billing and usage monitoring (`/admin/billing-use/`), and single sign-on integration (`/admin/single-sign-on/`) provide organizational control.

## Technical Implementation and API Endpoints

**Route Structure**: The platform uses hierarchical URL routing:
- Analytics: `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/{slug}`
- SDKs: `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/{slug}` and `/sdks/experiment-sdks/{slug}`
- APIs: `/apis/{product}/{slug}`
- Data: `/data/{feature}/{slug}`
- Experiment: `/feature-experiment/{feature}/{slug}`

**SDK Integration**: Platform-specific SDKs provide consistent event tracking with routes like `/sdks/analytics/android/`, `/sdks/analytics/ios/`, `/sdks/analytics/browser/` for client-side implementation and `/sdks/analytics/node/`, `/sdks/analytics/python/`, `/sdks/analytics/java/` for server-side tracking.

**Data Management**: The platform supports real-time data ingestion, event property management through the Identify API with `append()` and `set()` methods, and automated data governance through PII integrations (`/data/pii/`).

**Performance Optimization**: Query time sampling using 10% random user samples, intelligent caching by time interval (realtime, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly), and CSV export capabilities with row limits (10,000 for charts, 20,000 for Dashboard API calls).

**Multi-language Support**: International deployment capabilities with Japanese translation support and localized content management.

The platform's modular architecture enables organizations to start with basic analytics and progressively adopt advanced features like experimentation, session replay, and customer data platform capabilities as their analytical maturity grows.
