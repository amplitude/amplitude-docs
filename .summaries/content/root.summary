# Amplitude Analytics Platform

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics platform that enables organizations to track user behavior, analyze product usage, and optimize user experiences through data-driven insights. The platform provides a complete suite of analytics tools, experimentation capabilities, data management features, and developer SDKs designed to help product teams understand user journeys and make informed decisions across web, mobile, and server-side applications.

## Core Product Architecture and Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem operates through several interconnected product layers that work together to provide end-to-end analytics capabilities:

**Data Collection and Instrumentation Layer**: The foundation consists of Analytics SDKs across multiple platforms (Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal, Node.js, Python, Go, Java) that collect behavioral events and send them to Amplitude's HTTP V2 API. The Ampli code generation tool creates strongly-typed tracking libraries from centrally managed tracking plans, ensuring schema validation and implementation consistency across development teams.

**Analytics and Visualization Layer**: The core analytics engine processes collected data into multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Personas, Lifecycle, Revenue LTV, and specialized charts like Compass, Journeys, and Impact Analysis. Each chart type serves specific analytical needs with features like custom formulas, group-by filtering, conversion tracking, and behavioral clustering.

**Experimentation and Optimization Layer**: Amplitude Experiment provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities through client-side and server-side SDKs with remote and local evaluation modes. The platform supports sophisticated targeting including cohort-based targeting, account-level bucketing, and statistical testing with sequential methodology.

**Data Management and Governance Layer**: Amplitude Data serves as the central hub for tracking plan management, schema validation, and data quality monitoring. It includes derived properties, lookup tables, transformations, and the Observe feature for automatic event stream validation against tracking plans.

**Customer Data Platform Layer**: The CDP functionality includes a comprehensive Source Catalog with 70+ connectors for importing data from marketing platforms, attribution services, data warehouses, and other analytics tools. Destination streaming enables real-time behavioral data forwarding to external platforms.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Analytics Concepts**:
- **Events**: User actions or occurrences tracked in the system with associated properties
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes associated with individual users that update over time
- **Group Properties**: Account-level attributes for B2B analytics (requires Accounts add-on)
- **Device ID/User ID**: Primary identification mechanisms for cross-session user tracking
- **Session ID**: Identifier for user sessions with configurable timeout periods
- **Behavioral Cohorts**: Dynamic and static user groups based on behavior patterns

**Data Processing and Management**:
- **Tracking Plans**: Comprehensive schemas defining events, properties, and validation rules
- **Derived Properties**: Computed properties created retroactively using formulas (REGEXEXTRACT, SPLIT, CONCAT)
- **Lookup Tables**: CSV-based property enrichment with 100MB/1M row limits
- **Transformations**: Query-time data structure modifications without affecting raw data
- **Autocapture**: Automatic collection of user interactions (clicks, page views, form interactions)

**Technical Infrastructure**:
- **HTTP V2 API**: Primary event ingestion endpoint with batch processing capabilities
- **Amplitude ID**: Platform-generated unique identifier for users
- **API Key/Secret Key**: Project authentication credentials with self-service management
- **Server Zone**: Geographic data routing for EU/US data residency compliance
- **Monthly Tracked Users (MTU)**: Primary billing metric with quotas and overage fees

**Experimentation Terminology**:
- **Flag Key**: Unique identifier for feature flags within experiments
- **Variants**: Different treatments users can receive for a given flag
- **Deployment Key**: Authentication credential for experiment SDK initialization
- **Remote/Local Evaluation**: Two modes for flag evaluation (server-side vs client-side)
- **Exposure Tracking**: Monitoring when users are exposed to specific flag variants

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude operates as a central analytics hub within the modern data stack through multiple integration patterns:

**Identity Resolution and Cross-Platform Tracking**: The platform provides unified user identification across web, mobile, and server-side touchpoints through standardized device ID and user ID management. Portfolio Views enable cross-project analysis by merging up to 5 projects with user ID/device ID matching and the User Mapping API for identity aliasing.

**Marketing Technology Integration**: The Source Catalog includes extensive marketing platform integrations (Facebook Ads, Google Ads, HubSpot, Braze, Mailchimp) that import campaign metrics, email events, and attribution data. Mobile attribution platforms (AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch) provide real-time attribution through specialized APIs with 72-hour attribution windows.

**Data Warehouse and Enterprise Integration**: Sophisticated warehouse integrations support BigQuery, Snowflake, and Databricks with Change Data Capture capabilities, STRUCT/JSON handling, and enterprise authentication. File-based integrations through S3 and Google Cloud Storage enable batch data ingestion with multiple format support.

**Development and Deployment Ecosystem**: The platform integrates with modern development workflows through Git-like branching in Amplitude Data, Ampli CLI tools for code generation, and comprehensive SDK support across programming languages and frameworks. Session Replay and Guides & Surveys provide additional user experience optimization capabilities.
