# Amplitude Product Suite

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and data management platform that helps businesses understand user behavior, optimize experiences, and drive growth. The platform consists of several interconnected products and features:

1. **Analytics** - Core analytics capabilities for tracking user behavior and visualizing data through various charts and dashboards
2. **Experiment** - Feature experimentation and A/B testing platform
3. **CDP (Customer Data Platform)** - Data management and integration capabilities
4. **SDKs** - Client and server libraries for various platforms to instrument applications
5. **APIs** - Programmatic interfaces for data ingestion, retrieval, and management

Key use cases include user behavior analysis, funnel optimization, cohort analysis, feature experimentation, data integration, and personalization.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Event** - A user action or system occurrence tracked in Amplitude
2. **Event Property** - Metadata associated with an event
3. **User Property** - Attributes associated with a user
4. **Cohort** - A group of users who share common characteristics or behaviors
5. **Session** - A period of user engagement with an application
6. **Funnel** - A series of steps users take toward a conversion goal
7. **Retention** - Measurement of how many users return to an application over time
8. **Experiment** - A controlled test comparing different variations of a feature
9. **Source** - An origin point for data being imported into Amplitude
10. **Destination** - A target system where Amplitude data is exported
11. **Taxonomy** - The organizational structure of events and properties
12. **Instrumentation** - The process of implementing tracking in applications
13. **device_id** - Unique identifier for a device or browser
14. **user_id** - Unique identifier for a user, set by the client application
15. **amplitude_id** - Amplitude's internal user identifier

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude platform is designed as an integrated ecosystem:

1. **Data Collection Layer**
   - SDKs (Browser, Mobile, Server) capture user interactions
   - Sources integrate external data
   - APIs provide programmatic data ingestion

2. **Data Processing Layer**
   - Event processing and validation
   - Identity resolution
   - Data transformation

3. **Analytics Layer**
   - Charts and visualizations
   - Segmentation capabilities
   - User journey mapping

4. **Activation Layer**
   - Audience creation and management
   - Experiment configuration and analysis
   - Data export to destinations

5. **Management Layer**
   - Account administration
   - User permissions
   - Billing and usage tracking

Data flows from instrumented applications through SDKs or APIs into the Amplitude platform, where it's processed, analyzed, and can be exported to other systems through the destination catalog.

## API Endpoints and Usage

### Core API Endpoints

1. **HTTP V2 API** (Event Ingestion)
   - US: `https://api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`
   - EU: `https://api.eu.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`

2. **Identify API** (User Properties)
   - US: `https://api2.amplitude.com/identify`
   - EU: `https://api.eu.amplitude.com/identify`

3. **Export API** (Data Retrieval)
   - `https://amplitude.com/api/2/export`

4. **Dashboard REST API**
   - `https://amplitude.com/api/3/chart/[chart_id]/query`

5. **User Privacy API**
   - `https://amplitude.com/api/2/deletions/users`

6. **Experiment APIs**
   - Evaluation: `https://api.lab.amplitude.com/v1/vardata`
   - Management: `https://experiment.amplitude.com/api/1/experiments`

### SDK Implementation

Most SDKs follow a similar pattern for initialization and event tracking:

```javascript
// Browser SDK example
amplitude.init('API_KEY');
amplitude.track('Event Name', {
  property1: 'value1',
  property2: 'value2'
});
```

The Ampli SDK wrapper provides type-safe tracking with consistent event schemas across platforms.

### Command Line Usage

Some SDKs and tools support command line invocation:

```bash
# Example of using the Ampli CLI
npx @amplitude/ampli pull
npx @amplitude/ampli status
```
