Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment (A/B testing), Session Replay, CDP (Customer Data Platform), and supporting tools for data management and experimentation.

## Core Product Architecture

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, offering event-based tracking and analysis through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Pathfinder, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Compass, Data Tables, Personas, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, Revenue LTV, and Experiment Results. The platform supports both individual user analytics and B2B account-level reporting through group analytics capabilities.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing functionality with advanced statistical analysis, supporting both client-side and server-side experimentation. The platform includes experiment theory documentation, advanced techniques, workflow management, and comprehensive troubleshooting resources.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and replays user sessions to provide qualitative insights into user behavior, complementing the quantitative data from Analytics.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and routing through source and destination catalogs, audiences management, and warehouse-native capabilities.

## SDK and Integration Ecosystem

The platform supports extensive instrumentation through multiple SDKs:

**Analytics SDKs**: Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine SDKs, each with dedicated documentation and implementation guides accessible via routes like `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/{slug}`.

**Experiment SDKs**: Separate SDK collection for A/B testing implementation across various platforms, accessible via `/sdks/experiment-sdks/{slug}`.

**Ampli**: Type-safe analytics wrapper that generates strongly-typed tracking libraries, documented at `/sdks/ampli/{slug}`.

**Framework Integrations**: Support for popular development frameworks with specific integration guides at `/sdks/frameworks/{slug}`.

## API Infrastructure

The platform provides comprehensive API access through multiple endpoints:

**Analytics APIs**: Core analytics functionality accessible via `/apis/analytics/{slug}`
**Experiment APIs**: A/B testing and feature flag management at `/apis/experiment/{slug}`
**Guides and Surveys API**: In-app messaging and survey functionality at `/apis/guides-and-surveys/{slug}`

## Data Management and Sources

**Source Catalog**: Extensive collection of data sources with integration category taxonomies, accessible at `/data/source-catalog/{slug}`. This includes various data ingestion methods and third-party integrations.

**Destination Catalog**: Comprehensive destination integrations for data export and activation, organized by integration categories at `/data/destination-catalog/{slug}`.

**Audiences**: Customer segmentation and audience management tools at `/data/audiences/{slug}`.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Collections**: Content organization system using YAML configuration files that define routing, templates, and navigation structure
**Mount Points**: UUID-based content mounting system for organizing related documentation
**Navigation Injection**: System for injecting navigation context (`nav_title`) and product branding (`blade`) into content
**Sites and Propagation**: Multi-site content management with English (`en`) and Japanese (`jp`) site support
**Preview Targets**: Content preview system with URL generation and refresh capabilities
**Date Behavior**: Content visibility rules with `past: public` and `future: private` settings
**Taxonomies**: Content categorization system, particularly for integration catalogs

## Content Structure and Organization

The platform uses a hierarchical content structure with:
- **Root-level sections** accessible at `/{slug}`
- **Product-specific routes** like `/analytics/{slug}`, `/feature-experiment/{slug}`, `/session-replay/{slug}`
- **Chart-specific documentation** at `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/{slug}`
- **SDK documentation** organized by platform at `/sdks/{product}/{platform}/{slug}`

## Specialized Features

**Migration Tools**: Platform migration assistance and guides at `/migration/{slug}`
**Legacy Charts**: Backward compatibility documentation for older chart types
**Troubleshooting**: Comprehensive FAQ and troubleshooting resources at `/faq/{slug}` and product-specific troubleshooting sections
**Academy Content**: Educational resources and training materials
**Partners**: Partner ecosystem documentation and integrations at `/partners/{slug}`
**Agents**: Specialized agent-based functionality at `/docs/agents/{slug}`

## Multi-language Support

The platform supports internationalization with dedicated Japanese content at the root level for the `jp` site, with specialized navigation injection (`nav_title: japanese_content`) and helpful feedback hiding (`hide_helpful: true`).

## Web Experiment Platform

A specialized web experimentation tool accessible at `/web-experiment/{slug}` provides browser-based A/B testing capabilities separate from the main Experiment product.

The platform's architecture demonstrates a comprehensive approach to product analytics, experimentation, and customer data management, with extensive documentation, multiple integration points, and enterprise-grade administrative features. The routing structure and content organization reflect a mature product ecosystem designed to serve both technical implementers and business users across various use cases and organizational needs.
