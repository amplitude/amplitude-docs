Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with end-to-end product intelligence capabilities through four integrated core products: Analytics, Data, Experiment, and Session Replay, along with Guides and Surveys for in-product user engagement.

## Core Product Architecture

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational behavioral analytics engine, offering 15 distinct chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Compass, Data Tables, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, Lifecycle, Personas, Stickiness, Revenue LTV, and Experiment Results. This enables comprehensive user journey analysis and product performance measurement across digital touchpoints.

**Amplitude Data** functions as the centralized data management layer, orchestrating data integration, warehousing, and governance through Sources, Audiences, Destination Catalog, Source Catalog, PII Integrations, and Warehouse-native capabilities. It ensures bidirectional data flow between Amplitude and enterprise data infrastructure while maintaining data quality and governance standards.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities through a comprehensive framework encompassing Experiment Theory, Advanced Techniques, Under the Hood functionality, Workflow management, Experiment Results analysis, and Troubleshooting resources. This enables controlled feature deployment and data-driven product decision-making.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and reconstructs complete user sessions, providing visual behavioral insights that complement quantitative analytics with qualitative understanding of user interactions and usability patterns.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** replaces traditional popup systems with sophisticated in-product engagement tools designed to improve onboarding, feedback collection, retention, activation, and engagement metrics.

## Technical Integration Ecosystem

The platform provides extensive SDK coverage across development environments through three distinct integration pathways:

**Analytics SDKs** span 11 platforms (Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Java, Go, Python, Unity, Unreal) accessible via `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/{slug}` routing patterns.

**Experiment SDKs** offer dedicated experimentation capabilities across platforms through `/sdks/experiment-sdks/{slug}` endpoints.

**Ampli** provides type-safe analytics implementation with strongly-typed event tracking across platforms via `/sdks/ampli/{slug}`, ensuring code-level data quality and developer experience optimization.

**API Infrastructure** encompasses three primary API categories:
- Analytics API (`/apis/analytics/{slug}`)
- Experiment APIs (`/apis/experiment/{slug}`)
- Guides and Surveys API (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/{slug}`)

## Key Technical Nomenclature

**User Identification Architecture**: Implements a dual-identifier system using `user_id` for authenticated user tracking and `device_id` for device-level analytics, enhanced with `user_properties` for contextual user attributes.

**Event Data Model**: Distinguishes between event properties (describing specific user actions) and user properties (describing user characteristics), enabling granular behavioral segmentation and analysis.

**Collections Framework**: Organizes content through hierarchical collections with UUID-based mount points, enabling complex content relationships and structured documentation architecture. Collections use specific routing patterns with injection parameters for navigation context.

**Content Visibility Controls**: Implements date-based content management with `past: public` and `future: private` settings, controlling content publication states across development lifecycles.

**Navigation Injection System**: Uses `nav_title` injection to organize content within specific product contexts (analytics, data, experiment, apis) and implements blade-based product branding ("Amplitude Experiment", "Amplitude Session Replay", "Amplitude Guides and Surveys").

**Preview Infrastructure**: Provides content preview capabilities with refresh functionality for development and staging workflows, supporting iterative documentation development.

## Enterprise Integration Capabilities

**Data Warehouse Integration**: Enables warehouse-native Amplitude functionality with bidirectional data synchronization between Amplitude and enterprise data infrastructure, supporting modern data stack architectures.

**Third-party Ecosystem**: The Partners collection (`/partners/{slug}`) indicates extensive integration capabilities with external platforms and services.

**Internationalization Support**: Provides multi-site architecture with English (`en`) and Japanese (`jp`) variants, including dedicated Japanese translation collections for global enterprise deployment.

**Migration Framework**: Dedicated migration resources (`/migration/{slug}`) facilitate platform adoption with structured data transition workflows and best practices.

## Administrative and Governance Features

**Account Management** (`/admin/account-management/{slug}`) provides comprehensive user and organization administration with role-based access controls.

**Enterprise Authentication** (`/admin/single-sign-on/{slug}`) enables SSO integration with enterprise identity providers.

**Usage Monitoring** (`/admin/billing-use/{slug}`) offers real-time usage tracking and billing management with cost optimization insights.

**Educational Infrastructure**: Academy content provides structured learning paths and certification programs for platform adoption and advanced usage patterns.

**Support Architecture**: Comprehensive FAQ and troubleshooting documentation (`/faq/{slug}`) spans all product areas with searchable knowledge base functionality.

## Product Ecosystem Positioning

Amplitude positions itself as a complete product intelligence platform that bridges the gap between traditional web analytics and modern product analytics. The integrated architecture enables organizations to progress from basic event tracking through advanced experimentation and user experience optimization, supported by enterprise-grade data governance and extensive developer tooling. The platform's warehouse-native capabilities and comprehensive API ecosystem enable integration with modern data stacks while maintaining specialized product analytics capabilities that complement broader business intelligence infrastructure.
