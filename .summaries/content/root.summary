Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of several interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Core Product Architecture

The Amplitude ecosystem is built around several key products that work together to provide end-to-end user analytics and optimization:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, offering various chart types for data visualization including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Compass, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Revenue LTV, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Data Tables, and Experiment Results. Each chart type provides specialized insights into different aspects of user behavior and product performance.

**Amplitude Experiment** is the feature flagging and A/B testing platform that enables teams to run controlled experiments with advanced techniques, experiment theory, workflow management, and comprehensive result analysis. It includes specialized troubleshooting tools and integrates deeply with the analytics platform.

**Amplitude Session Replay** provides detailed user session recordings and analysis capabilities to understand user interactions at a granular level.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** offers in-product user experience tools for onboarding, engagement, and feedback collection through contextual guides and targeted surveys.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and distribution through source and destination catalogs, audience management, and warehouse-native capabilities.

## Product Relationships and Integration

The products are tightly integrated through shared data infrastructure and cross-product functionality. Analytics serves as the central hub where data from all other products converges for analysis. Experiment results are visualized through specialized Analytics charts, while Session Replay data can be analyzed alongside traditional analytics metrics. The CDP ensures consistent data flow between all products and external systems.

The platform supports multi-site deployment with English and Japanese localization, indicating global enterprise capabilities. Content propagation and revision control systems ensure consistency across different product areas and locales.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Collections** represent organized content groupings within the documentation system, each with specific routing patterns, navigation injection, and structural hierarchies.

**Mount Points** (identified by UUIDs) create content relationships and hierarchical structures between different documentation sections.

**Navigation Injection** (`nav_title`) determines how content appears in the platform's navigation system with categories like `analytics`, `experiment`, `data`, `apis`, `developers`, etc.

**Blade Designation** identifies specific product areas (e.g., "Amplitude Experiment", "Amplitude Session Replay", "Amplitude Guides and Surveys") for product-specific branding and functionality.

**Route Patterns** define URL structures using variables like `{slug}`, `{parent_uri}`, and `{permalink}` for dynamic content organization.

**Date Behavior** controls content visibility with past content being public and future content remaining private until publication.

**Sites and Propagation** manage multi-locale content distribution with English (`en`) and Japanese (`jp`) site variants.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The platform integrates with external systems through comprehensive API offerings including Analytics APIs, Experiment APIs, and Guides and Surveys APIs. SDK support spans multiple platforms and languages including Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine, enabling implementation across web, mobile, and gaming applications.

The **Ampli** code generation tool provides type-safe analytics implementation across different programming languages and platforms. Partner integrations and destination catalogs enable data sharing with external tools and platforms.

Administrative features include account management, billing and usage tracking, single sign-on integration, and PII (Personally Identifiable Information) handling capabilities for enterprise compliance requirements.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

The platform exposes REST APIs for programmatic access to analytics data, experiment configuration, and guides/surveys management. SDK implementations provide methods for event tracking, experiment evaluation, and in-product experience delivery.

Route patterns indicate API endpoint structures:
- `/apis/analytics/{slug}` for Analytics API documentation
- `/apis/experiment/{slug}` for Experiment API documentation  
- `/apis/guides-and-surveys/{slug}` for Guides and Surveys API documentation
- `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/{slug}` for platform-specific SDK documentation
- `/sdks/experiment-sdks/{slug}` for experiment SDK documentation

The documentation system supports preview functionality, content mounting for hierarchical organization, and taxonomy-based categorization for integration catalogs. Legacy chart support ensures backward compatibility while new chart types provide enhanced analytical capabilities.
