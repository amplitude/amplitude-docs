Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive data-driven decision making. The platform consists of multiple integrated products including Analytics, Experiment (feature flagging and A/B testing), Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Core Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The platform operates through several interconnected product areas that share common infrastructure and data models:

**Analytics** serves as the foundational layer, providing event tracking, user behavior analysis, and visualization capabilities through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, Journeys, Personas, Lifecycle, and specialized charts like Compass and Impact Analysis. These charts enable different analytical perspectives on user behavior patterns.

**Amplitude Experiment** integrates with the analytics infrastructure to provide feature flagging, A/B testing, and experimentation capabilities. It includes advanced techniques, experiment theory, workflow management, and comprehensive results analysis that leverages the underlying analytics engine.

**Session Replay** captures and analyzes user interaction recordings, providing qualitative insights that complement quantitative analytics data.

**Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user engagement and feedback collection, with data flowing back into the analytics platform for comprehensive user experience analysis.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and distribution through source and destination catalogs, audiences, and warehouse-native capabilities.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events**: Discrete user actions tracked within applications, forming the fundamental data unit for all analytics and experimentation.

**Properties**: Attributes associated with events or users that enable segmentation and detailed analysis.

**Cohorts**: User segments defined by specific behavioral criteria or characteristics, used across analytics and experimentation workflows.

**Funnels**: Sequential event analysis showing conversion rates between defined steps in user workflows.

**Retention**: Analysis of user return behavior over specified time periods.

**Journeys**: User path analysis showing navigation patterns and conversion flows through applications.

**Experiments**: A/B tests and feature flag implementations managed through Amplitude Experiment.

**Flags**: Feature toggles that control functionality exposure to different user segments.

**Variants**: Different versions of features or experiences tested within experiments.

**Conversion Windows**: Time-based parameters defining valid periods for event sequence completion.

**Segmentation**: Process of dividing users or events into meaningful groups for analysis.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The platform operates as a unified ecosystem where data flows seamlessly between components. Analytics SDKs (available for Android, iOS, Browser, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal) provide consistent data collection across platforms. The Ampli wrapper ensures type-safe event tracking with code generation capabilities.

APIs enable programmatic access to analytics data, experiment management, and guides/surveys functionality. The platform supports extensive integrations through source and destination catalogs, enabling data flow to and from external systems including data warehouses, marketing tools, and business intelligence platforms.

Administrative capabilities include account management, billing and usage tracking, single sign-on integration, and comprehensive user permission management. The platform supports multi-site deployments with localization capabilities including Japanese language support.

## Technical Implementation and Access Patterns

The platform provides multiple access methods including web-based interfaces for interactive analysis, REST APIs for programmatic access, and SDK integrations for data collection. Specific API endpoints support analytics data retrieval (`/apis/analytics/`), experiment management (`/apis/experiment/`), and guides/surveys operations (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`).

Chart-specific routes enable direct access to different analytical views (e.g., `/analytics/charts/funnel-analysis/`, `/analytics/charts/retention-analysis/`, `/analytics/charts/journeys/`). Experiment workflows are accessible through `/feature-experiment/` routes with specialized paths for advanced techniques, theory, troubleshooting, and workflow management.

The platform includes comprehensive migration support for users transitioning from other analytics platforms, with dedicated documentation and tooling to facilitate data and workflow migration. Partner integrations extend functionality through third-party connections and specialized use cases.
