# Amplitude Analytics and Experimentation Platform

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools for product analytics, feature experimentation, user engagement, and data management. The platform consists of several integrated products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Core Product Architecture and Relationships

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational product, providing event tracking, user behavior analysis, and advanced analytics capabilities through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Cohort Analysis, and specialized charts like Compass, Journeys, and Revenue LTV. The analytics platform supports both real-time and historical data analysis with advanced segmentation and behavioral cohort creation.

**Amplitude Experiment** integrates tightly with Analytics to provide feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities. It operates through two evaluation modes: Remote Evaluation (server-side processing) and Local Evaluation (client-side processing with cached configurations). The Experiment platform includes sophisticated targeting through cohort-based segmentation and supports both client-side and server-side implementations.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and reconstructs user sessions for qualitative analysis, complementing the quantitative insights from Analytics. **Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user engagement and feedback collection.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and distribution through source and destination catalogs, with warehouse-native capabilities for organizations using cloud data warehouses.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Event Tracking Fundamentals:**
- `event_type`: The name/category of tracked user actions
- `event_properties`: Custom attributes specific to individual events
- `user_properties`: Persistent attributes associated with users
- `group_properties`: Properties for account-level analysis (requires Accounts add-on)
- `amplitude_id`: Amplitude's internal user identifier
- `user_id`: Customer-defined user identifier
- `device_id`: Device-specific identifier for cross-session tracking
- `session_id`: Session boundary tracking identifier
- `insert_id`: Event deduplication identifier

**Experimentation Concepts:**
- **Deployment Key**: Authentication credential for experiment environment access
- **Flag Key**: Unique identifier for individual feature flags
- **Variants**: Different versions/values returned by feature flags
- **ExperimentUser**: User object containing identification and targeting properties
- **Exposure Tracking**: Recording when users encounter experiment variants
- **Remote vs Local Evaluation**: Server-side vs client-side flag evaluation modes
- **Evaluation Proxy**: Bridge component enabling local evaluation on unsupported platforms

**Analytics Terminology:**
- **Behavioral Cohorts**: User segments based on event patterns and properties
- **Audiences**: Targetable user groups for activation and personalization
- **Personas**: User archetypes based on behavioral patterns
- **Lifecycle Analysis**: User progression through engagement stages
- **Stickiness**: Frequency-based user engagement measurement

**Data Management:**
- **Taxonomy**: Schema management for events and properties (Enterprise feature)
- **Lookup Tables**: CSV-based property augmentation for events
- **Source Catalog**: Pre-built integrations for data ingestion
- **Destination Catalog**: Pre-built integrations for data activation
- **Warehouse-native**: Direct analysis of data in customer data warehouses

## SDK and Integration Ecosystem

**Analytics SDKs** provide comprehensive event tracking across platforms:
- Client-side: Browser SDK, Android SDK, iOS SDK, React Native SDK, Flutter SDK, Unity SDK, Unreal SDK
- Server-side: Node.js SDK, Python SDK, Java SDK, Go SDK
- **Ampli**: Type-safe wrapper providing compile-time validation and IDE autocomplete

**Experiment SDKs** enable feature flagging across the same platform coverage:
- Evaluation modes: `fetch()` for remote evaluation, `start()`/`evaluate()` for local evaluation
- Integration methods: `initializeWithAmplitudeAnalytics()` for seamless Analytics integration
- Configuration options: Server zones (EU data residency), polling intervals, timeout/retry settings
