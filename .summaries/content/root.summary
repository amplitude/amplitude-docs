## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Events**: User actions or system occurrences tracked in the platform
- **Properties**: Contextual metadata associated with events
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes associated with users across sessions
- **Sessions**: Periods of continuous user activity
- **Cohorts**: Groups of users sharing common attributes or behaviors
- **Funnels**: Sequential series of events tracking user progression
- **Retention**: Measurement of continued user engagement over time
- **Journeys**: Visualizations of user paths through a product
- **Experiments**: Controlled tests measuring the impact of product changes
- **SDKs**: Libraries for implementing Amplitude in applications
- **Instrumentation**: The process of implementing tracking in applications
- **Taxonomy**: Structured organization of events and properties
- **Integration**: Connection between Amplitude and other tools or platforms

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude ecosystem functions as an integrated suite with the following connections:

1. **Data Flow Architecture**:
   - SDKs collect data from applications
   - Data is processed through Amplitude's pipeline
   - Processed data becomes available in analytics tools
   - Data can be exported to external destinations

2. **Analytics and Experimentation Connection**:
   - Experiments leverage analytics data for impact measurement
   - Experiment results appear in analytics visualizations
   - User cohorts from analytics can be targeted in experiments

3. **Data Management Integration**:
   - Data sources feed into the analytics platform
   - Audiences created in analytics can be exported to destinations
   - CDP capabilities connect user data across touchpoints

4. **Session Replay and Analytics Synergy**:
   - Session recordings provide visual context for analytics data
   - Analytics events can be used to locate relevant session recordings
   - Heatmaps offer aggregate visual insights on user behavior

5. **Administration Layer**:
   - Controls access across all products
   - Manages billing and usage for the entire platform
   - Configures organization-wide settings

## Implementation Details and API Endpoints

### SDK Implementation Examples

```javascript
// Browser SDK
import * as amplitude from '@amplitude/analytics-browser';
amplitude.init('API_KEY');
amplitude.track('Button Clicked');

// iOS SDK
let amplitude = Amplitude(configuration: Configuration(apiKey: "API_KEY"))
amplitude.track(event: BaseEvent(eventType: "Button Clicked"))

// Android SDK
val amplitude = Amplitude(Configuration(apiKey = "API_KEY", context = applicationContext))
amplitude.track(BaseEvent("Button Clicked"))
```

### Ampli SDK (Type-safe wrapper)

```typescript
// Initialize Ampli
ampli.load({ client: { apiKey: 'API_KEY' } });

// Track events with type safety
ampli.buttonClicked({ buttonName: 'Submit' });
```

### Experiment SDK

```javascript
// Initialize Experiment
import { Experiment } from '@amplitude/experiment-js-client';
const experiment = Experiment.initialize({ apiKey: 'DEPLOYMENT_KEY' });

// Fetch variants
const variants = await experiment.fetch({ user_id: 'user-id' });
const variant = variants['feature-flag-key'];
```

### Session Replay Implementation

```javascript
// Browser SDK Plugin
import { sessionReplayPlugin } from '@amplitude/plugin-session-replay-browser';
amplitude.init('API_KEY', { plugins: [sessionReplayPlugin()] });
```

### API Endpoints

The platform exposes several API endpoints:

- Analytics API: `/api/2/httpapi` for event ingestion
- Experiment API: `/api/2/exposure` for tracking experiment exposures
- User Profile API: `/api/2/identify` for updating user properties
- Export API: `/api/2/export` for exporting raw data
- Audiences API: `/api/2/audiences` for managing user segments

The platform also supports integration with third-party tools through dedicated APIs and SDKs, including data warehouse integrations, marketing platforms, and customer engagement tools.
