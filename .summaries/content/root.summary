Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides product teams with tools for user behavior analysis, feature experimentation, and in-product user engagement. The platform consists of several interconnected products that work together to deliver insights and optimize user experiences across web and mobile applications.

## Core Product Architecture

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational data collection and analysis platform, providing event tracking, user segmentation, and behavioral analytics through a comprehensive charting system. The analytics engine supports multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Stickiness, Lifecycle, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, Revenue LTV, and Experiment Results charts.

**Amplitude Experiment** is the feature flagging and A/B testing platform that enables controlled feature rollouts and statistical experimentation. It includes advanced techniques for experiment design, comprehensive experiment theory documentation, workflow management, troubleshooting guides, and "under the hood" technical implementation details.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and replays user sessions to provide qualitative insights into user behavior and identify friction points in the user experience.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** delivers in-product user engagement through contextual guides, feedback collection surveys, and resource centers for user onboarding and support.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and routing through source and destination catalogs, audience management, and warehouse-native capabilities.

## SDK and Integration Ecosystem

The platform provides extensive SDK support across multiple programming languages and platforms:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser SDK (`/sdks/analytics/browser/`), Android SDK (`/sdks/analytics/android/`), iOS SDK (`/sdks/analytics/ios/`), React Native SDK (`/sdks/analytics/react-native/`), Flutter SDK (`/sdks/analytics/flutter/`), Node.js SDK (`/sdks/analytics/node/`), Python SDK (`/sdks/analytics-sdks/python/`), Java SDK (`/sdks/analytics/java/`), Go SDK (`/sdks/analytics/go/`), Unity SDK (`/sdks/analytics/unity/`), and Unreal SDK (`/sdks/analytics/unreal/`).

**Experiment SDKs** provide feature flagging capabilities across platforms through dedicated experiment SDK implementations (`/sdks/experiment-sdks/`).

**Ampli** is a code generation tool that creates type-safe analytics implementations, ensuring consistent event tracking across development teams (`/sdks/ampli/`).

## API Infrastructure

The platform exposes functionality through multiple API endpoints:

**Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/`) provides programmatic access to event data, user properties, and analytics queries.

**Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) enable feature flag management, experiment configuration, and result retrieval.

**Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) supports programmatic management of in-product experiences.

## Data Management and Integration

**Source Catalog** (`/data/source-catalog/`) provides pre-built integrations for data ingestion from various platforms, categorized by integration types through taxonomies.

**Destination Catalog** (`/data/destination-catalog/`) offers data export capabilities to external systems, also organized through integration category taxonomies.

**Audiences** (`/data/audiences/`) enables user segmentation and cohort management for targeted analysis and experimentation.

**PII Integrations** (`/data/pii/`) handle personally identifiable information with appropriate privacy controls.

**Warehouse-native Amplitude** (`/data/warehouse-native/`) provides direct integration with data warehouses for analysis without data movement.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** (`/admin/account-management/`) covers user provisioning, role management, and organizational settings.

**Single Sign-on** (`/admin/single-sign-on/`) provides enterprise authentication integration.

**Billing and Use** (`/admin/billing-use/`) manages subscription plans, usage tracking, and cost optimization.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** are user actions tracked within applications, forming the foundation of all analytics.

**Properties** are attributes associated with events or users that enable segmentation and analysis.

**Cohorts** are user segments based on behavioral or demographic criteria.

**Funnels** track user progression through defined sequences of events.

**Retention** measures user return behavior over time periods.

**Experiments** are controlled tests comparing different user experiences.

**Feature Flags** enable dynamic feature toggling without code deployments.

**Amplitude Agents** (`/docs/agents/`) appear to be automated analysis tools or AI-powered insights capabilities.

## Content Organization and Localization

The platform supports multi-site deployment with English (`en`) and Japanese (`jp`) localization. Japanese content is managed through dedicated translation collections (`japanese_translation`) with specialized routing and navigation injection.

**Academy Content** provides educational resources and best practices for platform usage.

**FAQ and Troubleshooting** sections offer comprehensive support documentation.

**Migration** guides assist users transitioning from other analytics platforms.

**Partners** documentation covers third-party integrations and ecosystem relationships.

## Navigation and Information Architecture

The platform uses a hierarchical navigation system with injected navigation titles including:
- `analytics` for core analytics features
- `experiment` for experimentation tools
- `data` for data management capabilities
- `apis` for API documentation
- `developers` for SDK and technical implementation
- `admin` for administrative functions
- `get_started` for onboarding content

The documentation architecture supports both structured hierarchical content and flat organizational patterns, with preview targets for content management and date-based publication controls for managing content visibility.

This comprehensive platform serves product teams, growth marketers, data analysts, and developers who need to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and make data-driven decisions about feature development and user engagement strategies.
