# Amplitude Product Documentation Overview

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform designed to help teams understand user behavior, make data-driven decisions, and optimize digital experiences. The platform offers a suite of integrated products that work together to provide end-to-end analytics and experimentation capabilities.

Key features include behavioral analytics, user segmentation, funnel analysis, retention tracking, feature flagging, A/B testing, customer data management, session recording, and in-app messaging. Amplitude enables product teams to track user interactions, analyze patterns, test hypotheses, and deliver personalized experiences based on data-driven insights.

Primary use cases include product optimization, user experience improvement, feature experimentation, conversion rate optimization, retention analysis, and personalized engagement strategies.

## Product and Feature Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem consists of several interconnected products:

### Analytics
- Core analytics platform for tracking and analyzing user behavior
- Includes visualization tools like Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis
- Provides user journey mapping and cohort creation capabilities
- Supports behavioral analytics across web and mobile platforms

### Experiment
- Feature flag and A/B testing platform for controlled experimentation
- Enables teams to test hypotheses and measure impact
- Integrates with Analytics for results measurement
- Supports both client-side and server-side implementation
- Includes targeting capabilities for specific user segments

### CDP (Customer Data Platform)
- Data management solution for unifying customer data
- Connects data sources and destinations
- Manages audience definitions and segmentation
- Handles PII (Personally Identifiable Information) compliance

### Session Replay
- Visual recording of user sessions for qualitative analysis
- Complements quantitative analytics with visual context
- Helps identify usability issues and user friction points

### Guides and Surveys
- In-app messaging and feedback collection tools
- Enables targeted communication based on user behavior
- Collects qualitative feedback to complement analytics data

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: A discrete user action or system occurrence tracked in Amplitude (e.g., button click, page view)
- **User Properties**: Attributes associated with users for segmentation (e.g., demographics, subscription status)
- **Cohort**: A defined group of users meeting specific criteria based on behavior or properties
- **Variant**: A specific version of a feature in an experiment
- **Flag**: A feature toggle that controls access to functionality
- **Experiment**: A controlled test comparing different variants of a feature
- **Deployment**: An environment configuration (e.g., production, staging, development)
- **Bucketing**: The process of assigning users to experiment variants
- **Exposure**: When a user encounters a feature flag or experiment
- **SDK**: Software Development Kit for implementing Amplitude in applications
- **API**: Application Programming Interface for programmatic interaction with Amplitude
- **Mutex Group**: A group of flags where only one can be active at a time
- **Holdout Group**: Users excluded from experiments for baseline comparison

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's products form an integrated ecosystem that supports the full analytics and experimentation lifecycle:

1. **Data Collection**: SDKs for various platforms (Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal, Node.js, Python, Java, Go) capture user behavior and send it to Amplitude.

2. **Data Processing**: The CDP organizes, structures, and routes data to appropriate destinations, ensuring data quality and compliance.

3. **Analysis**: The Analytics platform processes data into meaningful visualizations and insights through charts, dashboards, and reports.

4. **Experimentation**: The Experiment platform uses insights from Analytics to form hypotheses, then tests them through feature flags and A/B tests.

5. **Engagement**: Guides and Surveys interact with users based on their behavior and segment membership.

6. **Optimization**: Session Replay provides qualitative context for the quantitative data, helping teams understand the "why" behind the numbers.

The platform supports both client-side and server-side implementations, with options for local or remote evaluation of experiments. Data can flow bidirectionally between Amplitude and other tools in a company's tech stack through the extensive integration catalog.

## API Endpoints and Implementation

### Analytics API
- Supports querying analytics data and managing users
- Enables programmatic access to charts, cohorts, and user data

### Experiment Management API
