Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of several interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

**Analytics Core** serves as the foundation, offering multiple chart types for behavioral analysis: Event Segmentation for user action analysis, Funnel Analysis for conversion tracking, Retention Analysis for user stickiness measurement, User Sessions for engagement patterns, Journeys for path analysis, Lifecycle for user state transitions, Personas for behavioral clustering, Compass for metric monitoring, Impact Analysis for feature assessment, Revenue LTV for monetization insights, Engagement Matrix for activity correlation, Stickiness for usage frequency, and Data Tables for raw data exploration.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced statistical methods, experiment theory foundations, and comprehensive results analysis. The platform supports sophisticated targeting, multi-armed bandit optimization, and integration with the analytics ecosystem for holistic performance measurement.

**Session Replay** captures and analyzes user interactions to provide qualitative insights complementing quantitative analytics data, enabling teams to understand the "why" behind user behaviors identified in charts and funnels.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation through Sources (data collection), Destinations (data distribution), Audiences (user segmentation), and warehouse-native capabilities for organizations using modern data stacks.

**Guides and Surveys** delivers in-product user experiences through contextual guidance, feedback collection, and onboarding flows, with tight integration to analytics for measuring experience effectiveness.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** - User actions tracked within applications, forming the foundation of all analytics and serving as triggers for experiments and guides

**Properties** - Attributes associated with events or users that enable segmentation and personalization across all platform features

**Cohorts/Audiences** - User segments defined by behavioral criteria, usable across analytics charts, experiment targeting, and guide delivery

**Flags** - Feature toggles in Amplitude Experiment that control feature visibility and experiment participation

**Variants** - Different versions of features or experiences served through experiments, with performance measured via analytics integration

**Ampli** - Type-safe SDK wrapper that ensures consistent event tracking across platforms and teams through code generation

**Taxonomies** - Standardized event and property naming conventions that maintain data quality across the platform

**Microscope** - Session replay analysis tool for qualitative user behavior investigation

**Warehouse-native** - Architecture pattern enabling analytics directly on customer data warehouses without data movement

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The platform operates as a unified ecosystem where analytics data informs experiment design, experiment results drive product decisions measured through continued analytics, and user experiences delivered via Guides and Surveys are optimized based on behavioral insights. The CDP ensures consistent data flow between all components while maintaining data governance and privacy compliance.

Integration extends beyond Amplitude's native products through extensive partner ecosystems including data sources (marketing platforms, customer support tools, payment processors), destinations (marketing automation, data warehouses, business intelligence tools), and development frameworks. The platform supports both cloud and on-premises deployments with enterprise-grade security and compliance certifications.
