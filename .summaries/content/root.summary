Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with behavioral analytics, data management, experimentation capabilities, and session replay functionality. The platform consists of four core products working together to deliver end-to-end product intelligence across web, mobile, and server environments.

## Core Product Architecture

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational behavioral analytics engine, featuring 17+ specialized chart types organized around four strategic use cases: knowing users (Event Segmentation, User Sessions, Data Tables), converting users (Funnel Analysis, Journeys, Experiment Results), retaining users (Retention Analysis, Lifecycle, Stickiness), and monetizing users (Revenue LTV, Personas, Engagement Matrix, Compass). The platform processes both real-time and batched events with sophisticated filtering capabilities using glob operators, array operators, and behavioral cohorts.

**Amplitude Data** functions as the central data management and governance layer, providing schema management, data warehouse integration, tracking plan management through Amplitude Data, and comprehensive source/destination catalog management. The platform supports over 100 destination integrations across event streaming, cohort sync, data warehouse, and specialized platforms.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers feature flagging and experimentation capabilities with advanced techniques, experiment theory, workflow management, and results analysis. The product integrates deeply with the analytics foundation to measure experiment impact through specialized charts and statistical analysis.

**Amplitude Session Replay** provides session recording and replay functionality across web, mobile, and React Native platforms, featuring heatmaps (click maps, selector maps, scroll maps), privacy controls with three masking levels, and multi-platform support through plugin architecture.

## Technical Implementation Framework

**SDK Ecosystem**: The platform provides comprehensive SDK coverage including Browser SDK 2.x (current flagship), Browser SDK 1.x and JavaScript SDK (maintenance mode), Marketing Analytics SDK, and platform-specific SDKs for Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal, Node.js, Python, Java, and Go. The Ampli code generation wrapper creates strongly-typed TypeScript/JavaScript APIs from tracking plans.

**API Infrastructure**: RESTful APIs support data ingestion through HTTP V2 API, configuration management, programmatic access to analytics data, experiment management, and session replay metadata. Key endpoints include Analytics API, Experiment APIs, and Guides and Surveys API.

**Data Architecture**: The platform implements sophisticated identity resolution combining Device ID, User ID, and Amplitude ID for unified user profiles across anonymous sessions, multiple devices, and authenticated states. Revenue tracking uses `logRevenueV2()` with receipt verification, while session management employs configurable timeout intervals (5min mobile, 30min web default).

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Core Tracking Concepts**:
- **Events/User Properties**: Fundamental data model where events represent user actions and properties provide contextual metadata
- **Behavioral Cohorts**: Advanced user segments based on specific behavioral patterns and event sequences
- **Session Management**: Unix timestamp-based session IDs with configurable timeout thresholds and out-of-session event handling
- **Identity Resolution**: Multi-identifier system using Amplitude ID, Device ID, and User ID for cross-platform user tracking

**Configuration Parameters**:
- **flushQueueSize/flushIntervalMillis**: Batch processing controls for event transmission optimization
- **serverZone**: Data residency configuration (US/EU) for GDPR compliance
- **trackingOptions**: Selective field tracking controls for privacy management
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible framework supporting EnrichmentPlugin and DestinationPlugin types

**Advanced Analytics Concepts**:
- **Query Time Sampling**: 10% random user samples with up-sampling for performance optimization
- **Cart Analysis**: Object array analysis for e-commerce requiring property splitting setup
- **Autocapture**: Automated tracking of page views, form interactions, file downloads, and element interactions

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

**Data Pipeline Integration**: The platform integrates with enterprise data warehouses (Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery) through standardized schemas, supports bidirectional data flow, and handles timezone differences between UTC exports and project timezone displays. The Export API provides programmatic access with server_upload_time-based filtering.

**Third-Party Platform Ecosystem**: Native integrations include iTunes Connect/Google Play for receipt verification, Segment cloud-mode connections, Google Tag Manager, and comprehensive destination catalog covering marketing automation (Braze, Customer.io), advertising platforms (Facebook Ads, Google Ads), and customer success tools.

**Development Workflow**: Amplitude CLI provides tracking plan management through `ampli pull` and `ampli status` commands, while the platform supports TypeScript/JavaScript with ES6+ compatibility, CJS module packaging, and Content Security Policy compliance for enterprise environments.

## API Endpoints and CLI Commands

**Core SDK Methods**:
```javascript
amplitude.init(API_KEY, options)
amplitude.track(eventType, eventProperties)
amplitude.identify(identifyEvent)
amplitude.flush()
ampli.load(options)
ampli.track.eventName(properties)
```

**CLI Operations**:
```bash
ampli pull [--path ./src/ampli]
ampli status [--is-latest]
npm install @amplitude/analytics-browser
```

**Configuration Endpoints**:
- **Session Replay**: `getSessionReplayProperties()`, `start()`/`stop()`, `setSessionId()`/`setDeviceId()`
- **Revenue Tracking**: `logRevenueV2()` with properties `$revenue`, `$price`, `$quantity`
- **Identity Management**: `setMinTimeBetweenSessionsMillis()`, `setOptOut()`

**Administrative Functions**:
- **Account Management**: User provisioning, role-based access control, billing management
- **Single Sign-On**: SAML/OAuth integration for enterprise authentication
- **Data Governance**: PII handling, data retention policies, DSAR API compliance

The platform represents a comprehensive product intelligence solution enabling organizations to understand user behavior, optimize experiences, and drive business growth through data-driven decision making across the entire user lifecycle.
