# Amplitude Analytics Platform

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools for product analytics, feature experimentation, customer data management, and user engagement optimization. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products designed to support the complete product development and optimization lifecycle.

## Product Architecture and Core Components

### Analytics Foundation
The **Analytics** product serves as the platform's core, providing event-based tracking and analysis capabilities. It encompasses multiple specialized chart types including **Event Segmentation** for behavioral analysis, **Funnel Analysis** for conversion tracking, **Retention Analysis** for user engagement measurement, **User Sessions** for session-based insights, **Revenue LTV** for monetization analysis, and **Cohort Analysis** through the **Lifecycle** charts. Advanced visualization tools include **Compass** for metric monitoring, **Journeys** for user path analysis, **Personas** for user segmentation, **Stickiness** for engagement measurement, and **Impact Analysis** for feature impact assessment.

### Experimentation Platform
**Amplitude Experiment** provides a complete A/B testing and feature flag management solution, encompassing **Experiment Theory** for statistical foundations, **Advanced Techniques** for sophisticated testing methodologies, **Workflow** management for experiment lifecycle, and **Under the Hood** technical implementation details. The platform includes specialized **Experiment Results** analytics and comprehensive **Experiment Troubleshooting** resources.

### Customer Data Platform
The **CDP (Customer Data Platform)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation through **Sources** for data collection, **Destination Catalog** for data distribution, **Audiences** for user segmentation, and **Warehouse-native Amplitude** for direct data warehouse integration. The platform includes **PII Integrations** for privacy-compliant data handling.

### Engagement Tools
**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user engagement through targeted messaging and feedback collection. **Session Replay** provides detailed user interaction recordings for qualitative analysis and debugging.

### Specialized Analytics
**Web Experiment** offers web-specific experimentation capabilities, while **Agents** provides AI-powered analytics assistance for automated insights and recommendations.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Core Analytics Concepts
- **Events**: User actions tracked within applications, forming the foundation of all analytics
- **Properties**: Attributes associated with events or users that enable segmentation and analysis
- **Cohorts**: User groups defined by shared characteristics or behaviors
- **Funnels**: Sequential event flows used to measure conversion rates
- **Segments**: Filtered subsets of users or events based on specific criteria
- **Attribution**: Methods for crediting user actions to marketing campaigns or product features

### Experimentation Terminology
- **Feature Flags**: Boolean toggles that control feature availability
- **Variants**: Different versions of features tested in experiments
- **Statistical Significance**: Confidence level that observed differences are not due to chance
- **Lift**: Percentage improvement of a variant over the control group
- **Allocation**: Distribution of users across experiment variants

### Data Management
- **Schema**: Structure defining event and property specifications
- **Taxonomy**: Organized classification system for events and properties
- **Governance**: Policies and procedures for data quality and compliance
- **Transformations**: Data processing rules applied during ingestion
- **Identity Resolution**: Process of linking user actions across devices and sessions

### Platform Infrastructure
- **SDKs**: Software Development Kits for implementing tracking across platforms
- **APIs**: Application Programming Interfaces for programmatic access
- **Integrations**: Pre-built connections to third-party tools and platforms
- **Destinations**: External systems receiving processed data from Amplitude
