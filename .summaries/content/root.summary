Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and make data-driven decisions through integrated analytics, experimentation, and customer data management capabilities.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform centers around an event-based analytics engine with four primary product modules:

**Analytics** serves as the foundational layer, processing user events and behaviors through specialized chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, and Revenue LTV charts. Each chart type addresses specific analytical questions about user behavior patterns and business performance.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with controlled rollouts, statistical analysis, sequential testing methodologies, and comprehensive results interpretation. The platform includes advanced experimentation techniques, workflow management, and troubleshooting tools for reliable hypothesis testing.

**Session Replay** captures and reconstructs user sessions to identify friction points and optimization opportunities through visual analysis of actual user interactions.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages unified data orchestration including ingestion, transformation, and activation across customer touchpoints, with audience management, source/destination catalogs, and warehouse-native capabilities.

## Key Terminology and Concepts

**Events** represent discrete user actions that form the analytical foundation, enhanced by **Properties** that provide contextual attributes for both events and users.

**Cohorts/Audiences** define user groups based on shared characteristics or behaviors, enabling targeted analysis and activation campaigns.

**Funnels** measure conversion through multi-step user journeys, while **Retention** analysis tracks user return patterns over time to measure product engagement.

**Amplitude IDs** provide unique user identification across platforms and sessions, ensuring consistent user tracking.

**Feature Flags** control feature availability and experiment variant assignment, with **Exposure Events** indicating when users encounter specific experiment conditions.

**Ampli** represents Amplitude's type-safe analytics wrapper that generates strongly-typed event tracking libraries from centralized tracking plans.

**Sequential Testing** enables continuous experiment monitoring with statistical rigor and controlled error rates.

## SDK and Implementation Ecosystem

The platform provides comprehensive instrumentation through platform-specific SDKs:

**Analytics SDKs** support Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine environments for event tracking and user identification.

**Experiment SDKs** handle feature flag evaluation and variant assignment across multiple platforms with consistent APIs.

**Ampli** generates type-safe tracking implementations from centrally managed tracking plans, ensuring data quality and developer experience consistency.

## API Structure and Endpoints

The platform exposes APIs through organized namespaces:

**Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/`) handles event ingestion, user property updates, and data export operations.

**Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) manage feature flag configuration, variant assignment, and exposure tracking.

**Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) controls in-product messaging and survey management.

URL routing follows consistent patterns with product-specific prefixes (`/analytics/`, `/feature-experiment/`, `/data/`, `/sdks/`) for logical organization.

## Data Flow and Integration Architecture

The CDP orchestrates data movement through:

**Sources** catalog various data ingestion points from external platforms and tools, organized by integration categories and taxonomies.

**Destinations** enable data activation to marketing tools, data warehouses, and downstream systems through the destination catalog.

**Warehouse-native Amplitude** provides direct data warehouse integration for analysis without data movement requirements.

**PII Management** includes specialized handling patterns for personally identifiable information with dedicated integration workflows.

## Platform Administration

Administrative capabilities encompass:

**Account Management** with user provisioning, permissions, and organizational structure controls.

**Single Sign-on** integration for enterprise authentication systems.

**Billing and Usage** monitoring for cost management and resource optimization.

**Migration Tools** supporting platform transitions and data migration scenarios.

The platform supports multi-site deployment with internationalization capabilities, including Japanese language support, comprehensive FAQ resources, troubleshooting documentation, and partner ecosystem integrations for extended functionality.

## Analytical Capabilities

Amplitude's chart types enable diverse analytical approaches optimized for specific business questions, supporting both real-time and historical analysis with flexible segmentation and comparative capabilities across complete user journeys. The platform facilitates conversion optimization, user behavior analysis, and business performance measurement through its integrated analytical framework.
