Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables product teams to understand user behavior, optimize experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple integrated products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a robust data management layer, all designed to provide end-to-end visibility into the customer journey.

## Core Product Architecture

The Amplitude ecosystem is built around several interconnected products that share a common data foundation:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the core behavioral analytics engine, offering multiple chart types for deep user behavior analysis including Event Segmentation (trend analysis and user action breakdowns), Funnel Analysis (conversion optimization with step-by-step dropoff analysis), Retention Analysis (cohort-based user return patterns), User Sessions (session-level behavior analysis), Journeys (user path visualization), Lifecycle (user state transitions), Stickiness (usage frequency analysis), Personas (behavioral user segmentation), Compass (KPI monitoring with statistical significance testing), Revenue LTV (customer lifetime value analysis), Impact Analysis (feature impact measurement), Engagement Matrix (feature adoption vs. retention), Data Tables (flexible data exploration), and Experiment Results (A/B test performance analysis).

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced statistical methods, supporting local and remote evaluation modes, multi-armed bandit optimization, sequential testing, and sophisticated targeting rules based on user properties and behavioral cohorts.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and reconstructs user sessions for qualitative analysis, enabling teams to understand the "why" behind quantitative metrics through visual session playback and user interaction analysis.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user research and onboarding through targeted surveys, NPS collection, and user feedback mechanisms integrated directly into the product experience.

## Data Management and Instrumentation

The platform's data layer is managed through a comprehensive Customer Data Platform (CDP) that handles data ingestion, transformation, and distribution across the analytics ecosystem.

**SDK Ecosystem** supports comprehensive instrumentation across platforms including Browser SDK (JavaScript/TypeScript with autocapture capabilities), Mobile SDKs (Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Unity), Server-side SDKs (Node.js, Python, Java, Go), and Framework Integrations for popular development environments.

**Ampli Developer Tools** provide type-safe code generation from tracking plans, enabling teams to implement analytics with compile-time validation and reducing instrumentation errors through auto-generated wrapper functions for each defined event.

**Data Sources and Destinations** facilitate ecosystem integration through the Source Catalog (ingesting data from third-party platforms) and Destination Catalog (streaming events to downstream tools with 60-second p95 latency), supporting real-time data synchronization and comprehensive data activation workflows.

## Advanced Analytics and Experimentation Features

**Statistical Analysis Capabilities** include automatic statistical significance testing, confidence intervals, sample size calculations, sequential testing for early experiment termination, and multi-armed bandit optimization for dynamic traffic allocation.

**Segmentation and Targeting** enables sophisticated user classification through behavioral cohorts, property-based segments, predictive audiences, and real-time user state evaluation for personalization and experimentation.

**Data Transformation and Enrichment** supports retroactive data modification through transformations, custom event creation using logical operators, derived properties with formula-based calculations (REGEXEXTRACT, SPLIT, CURRENCY_CONVERT functions), and lookup table integration for external data enrichment.

## Enterprise Features and Governance

**Data Governance** includes comprehensive tracking plan management with Git-like branching workflows, schema validation with real-time monitoring, Data Access Control (DAC) with property classification and group-based permissions, and AI-powered data quality recommendations.

**Administrative Controls** provide organization-level management through Single Sign-On (SSO) integration, role-based access controls (Admin/Manager/Member/Viewer), billing and usage monitoring, account management workflows, and cross-project portfolio analysis supporting up to 5 projects.

**Privacy and Compliance** features include complete user data deletion for GDPR/CCPA compliance through the User Privacy API, PII detection and handling, configurable data retention policies with Time-to-Live (TTL) settings, and comprehensive audit logging.

## API Infrastructure and Integration Points

**Core APIs** include:
- **HTTP V2 API**: Real-time event ingestion with user_agent field for bot filtering
- **Batch Event Upload API**: Historical data import supporting 500K events per device ID daily
- **Analytics API**: Programmatic access to chart data and analysis results
- **Experiment APIs**: Feature flag evaluation and experiment management
- **Guides and Surveys API**: In-product experience management
- **Taxonomy API**: CRUD operations for event and property definitions
- **User Privacy API**: Complete user data deletion capabilities

**Command Line Tools** include:
- `ampli pull`: Downloads tracking plans and generates type-safe code
- `ampli status --is-merged`: Checks branch merge status for CI/CD integration

**Warehouse Integration** supports native connections to Snowflake, Databricks, and Amazon S3 with Mirror Sync strategies, Change Data Capture (CDC) for real-time synchronization, and Profiles for customer profile data joining using incremental modeling.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** represent user actions or system occurrences that are tracked and analyzed, forming the fundamental unit of measurement in Amplitude's behavioral analytics model.

**Properties** are attributes associated with events or users that provide context and enable segmentation, including event properties (action-specific data) and user properties (persistent user characteristics).

**Cohorts** are dynamic user segments based on behavioral criteria or property values, automatically updating as users meet or no longer meet the defined conditions.

**Tracking Plans** serve as the schema definition and governance layer, specifying which events and properties should be collected, their data types, and validation rules.

**Transformations** enable retroactive data modification and enrichment, allowing teams to clean, standardize, and enhance historical data without requiring re-instrumentation.

**Amplitude IDs** are persistent user identifiers that enable cross-platform user journey tracking and attribution across devices and sessions.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude functions as a central hub in the modern data stack, integrating with various categories of tools:

**Data Infrastructure** connections include data warehouses (Snowflake, Databricks, BigQuery), customer data platforms, and ETL/ELT tools for comprehensive data pipeline management.

**Product Development** integrations span feature flag platforms, A/B testing tools, product management software, and development frameworks to enable data-driven product decisions.

**Marketing and Growth** ecosystem connections include advertising platforms, email marketing tools, push notification services, and attribution platforms for comprehensive growth analytics.

**Customer Success** integrations encompass support platforms, onboarding tools, and customer health scoring systems to optimize the entire customer lifecycle.

The platform serves organizations ranging from startups to enterprises, providing scalable analytics infrastructure that grows with business needs while maintaining data quality, governance, and performance standards across the entire customer analytics lifecycle.
