Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user engagement platform that enables product, growth, and marketing teams to create contextual, interactive experiences directly within their applications. The platform serves as an alternative to traditional popups, focusing on user onboarding, feedback collection, and improving retention, activation, and engagement metrics.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of three primary components working together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** are interactive, multi-step experiences that help users navigate product features and complete tasks. They support five distinct form factors: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual bubbles), Pin (anchored markers), Tooltip (hover information), Banner (persistent notifications), and Checklist (task completion tracking). Guides utilize behavioral triggers, strike detection, and rate-limiting mechanisms to ensure optimal user experience.

**Surveys** focus on feedback collection through four specialized block types: Rating (Stars, NPS, Emoji, Rating labels), Long answer, Short answer, and List (multiple choice). Surveys support conditional logic for dynamic response branching and can be deployed using a subset of guide form factors (modal, popover, pin).

**Resource Center** functions as an intelligent help widget that integrates with the Guides and Surveys SDK, providing search functionality, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. It features an Autopilot system using semantic search algorithms to automatically generate article recommendations by analyzing page content and surfacing relevant materials from content repositories.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Guides and Surveys integrates deeply with the broader Amplitude ecosystem:

- **Amplitude Analytics**: Full event tracking integration with comprehensive analytics schema including Guide Viewed, Guide Completed, Guide Dismissed, Survey Submitted, Survey Abandoned, and Survey Completed events
- **Amplitude Experiment**: Native A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys with variant tracking
- **Amplitude CDP**: User segmentation and targeting capabilities leveraging Amplitude's customer data platform
- **Third-party Analytics**: Support for Segment, Google Tag Manager, and other analytics providers

## Key Features and Capabilities

**Themes System** provides extensive customization through Brand controls and Component editor sections, allowing modification of colors, typography, form controls, cards, widget dimensions, and animations. **Localization** support enables multi-language content delivery through SDK locale configuration, AI-powered translation capabilities, and XLIFF file workflow support.

**Targeting and Personalization** includes sophisticated user segmentation, trigger conditions (element appearance/clicks, time delays, rage clicks, user confusion, event tracking), session properties, page targeting with URL matching patterns, and priority levels. The **Personalize with Variables** functionality dynamically inserts client-side user properties into content with fallback values.

**Throttling Configuration** controls guide/survey appearance rates through configurable limits and time periods (day/week/month/session), with separate settings for guides versus surveys to optimize user experience.

## Technical Implementation

**Multi-Platform SDK Support** spans:
- **Web**: `@amplitude/engagement-browser` with methods like `engagement.init()`, `engagement.boot()`, `engagement.forwardEvent()`, `engagement.setThemeMode()`, and `engagement.gs.show()`
- **iOS**: AmplitudeEngagement with Swift Package Manager/CocoaPods, using `accessibilityIdentifier` and `amplitudeView` modifier for element targeting
- **Android**: amplitude-engagement-android with Jetpack Compose support, utilizing `.amplitudeView` modifier and `contentDescription`/tag selectors
- **React Native**: `@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native` for cross-platform mobile development

**Mobile SDKs** support screen tracking, theme management, and preview mode configuration with custom URL schemes. Both platforms provide element targeting through platform-specific approaches for precise guide and survey placement.

## Content Management and Organization

**Content Management** features include template systems for reusable starting points, tags for organizing guides and surveys, and bulk operations for efficient management. **Testing and Preview** capabilities allow verification of trigger, limit, and throttle conditions before launch, with troubleshooting tools and live testing using cohort targeting.

The **Website Scraper** functionality enables automatic content extraction from documentation repositories using URL extraction methods, CSV/XML sitemap upload, advanced filtering with URL path inclusion/exclusion, and content selector overrides for targeting specific page elements.

## Access Control and Infrastructure

A comprehensive **Role-Based Permission System** provides five access levels (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) with specific capabilities for viewing, editing, publishing guides/surveys, and running experiments. This system overrides base Amplitude user roles for granular access control.

**Proxy Configuration** through AWS CloudFront enables unified distribution with specific origins (cdn.amplitude.com for static assets, gs.amplitude.com for API requests) and critical `/sdk/*` path patterns for API routing. **Custom CSS** styling capabilities provide extensive customization options for form factors and survey elements, currently available as a beta feature for web SDK.
