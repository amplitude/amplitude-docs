Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables product teams to understand user behavior, optimize experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of four core products integrated through a unified Customer Data Platform (CDP) and supported by extensive SDK and API ecosystems.

## Core Product Architecture

**Amplitude Analytics** forms the analytical foundation with specialized chart types for behavioral analysis:
- **Event Segmentation** for action-based analysis
- **Funnel Analysis** for conversion tracking
- **Retention Analysis** for user return behavior
- **User Sessions** for interaction grouping
- **Journeys** for user path mapping
- **Stickiness** for engagement frequency
- **Lifecycle** for user stage categorization
- **Personas** for user segmentation
- **Compass** for metric monitoring
- **Data Tables** for raw data exploration
- **Engagement Matrix** for feature adoption
- **Impact Analysis** for change measurement
- **Revenue LTV** for monetization analysis
- **Experiment Results** for A/B test outcomes

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with statistical rigor, supporting both client-side and server-side experimentation through advanced workflow management and comprehensive troubleshooting.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures user sessions for qualitative behavioral insights, providing visual context to complement quantitative analytics data.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** delivers in-product user engagement through contextual guides, feedback surveys, and resource centers for improved onboarding and direct user insight collection.

## Customer Data Platform (CDP)

The CDP serves as central data infrastructure managing ingestion, transformation, and activation:
- **Sources** collect data from multiple touchpoints
- **Audiences** enable user segmentation and targeting
- **Destination Catalog** provides extensive third-party integrations
- **Source Catalog** supports multiple data input methods
- **Warehouse-native Amplitude** enables direct data warehouse integration
- **PII Integrations** ensure privacy-compliant data handling

## SDK Ecosystem and Instrumentation

Amplitude provides platform-specific SDKs with consistent API patterns:

**Analytics SDKs** span Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal platforms, each optimized for their respective environments.

**Experiment SDKs** deliver feature flagging and experimentation across the same platform ecosystem for consistent A/B testing and feature management.

**Ampli** generates type-safe, strongly-typed tracking libraries from Amplitude's Data taxonomy, ensuring consistent and error-free event instrumentation across teams and platforms.

## API Infrastructure

The platform exposes comprehensive programmatic access through:
- **Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/`) for data querying and analysis
- **Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) for feature flag and experiment management
- **Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) for in-product experience management

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** represent user actions or system occurrences tracked with properties and user context. **User Properties** describe user attributes while **Event Properties** provide action-specific context.

**Cohorts** define user segments based on behavioral criteria. **Funnels** track user progression through defined sequences. **Retention** measures user return behavior over time.

**Feature Flags** control feature visibility and behavior. **Experiments** compare different user experiences through statistical testing with **Variants** representing different experiment treatments.

**Sessions** group related user activities within time boundaries. **Journeys** map user application paths. **Lifecycle** stages categorize users by engagement patterns.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The platform integrates through consistent route structures:
- `/analytics/` for core analytics features
- `/sdks/` for SDK documentation and resources
- `/apis/` for API references
- `/data/` for CDP and data management
- `/feature-experiment/` for experimentation capabilities
- `/admin/` for administrative functions

**Account Management** provides organizational controls, user permissions, and access management. **Single Sign-on** enables enterprise authentication integration. **Billing and Use** tracks platform usage and manages subscriptions.

## Partnership and Integration Ecosystem

The **Partners** program includes technology integrations, consulting services, and solution providers. The **Destination Catalog** and **Source Catalog** feature extensive third-party integrations categorized by function including analytics, marketing, and data warehouses.

## Developer Resources and Enterprise Features

**Get Started** guides provide onboarding paths for different user types. **Migration** resources assist with platform transitions and data imports. **FAQ and Troubleshooting** sections provide comprehensive support documentation. **Academy Content** offers educational resources for platform mastery.

The platform includes **Japanese Translation** capabilities indicating international market support with localized content and interfaces.

## Technical Implementation

The platform uses mount points for hierarchical content organization with navigation injection for consistent user experience across product areas. Preview targets enable content review workflows while date behaviors control content visibility based on publication status.

This comprehensive platform enables organizations to implement complete product analytics and experimentation workflows from data collection through analysis to optimization, supported by extensive developer tools and enterprise-grade administrative capabilities.
