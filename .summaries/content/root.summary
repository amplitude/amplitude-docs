# Amplitude Digital Analytics and Experimentation Platform

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables businesses to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products: Analytics (behavioral analytics), Experiment (A/B testing and feature flags), Session Replay (user interaction capture), Guides and Surveys (in-product engagement), and a Customer Data Platform (CDP) for data management and activation.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational product, providing event-based behavioral analytics through specialized chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, Lifecycle charts, Journeys, User Sessions, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Stickiness, Impact Analysis, Revenue LTV, and Engagement Matrix. Each chart type addresses specific analytical use cases, from basic event counting to complex user journey mapping and revenue attribution.

**Amplitude Experiment** integrates with Analytics to provide feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced statistical analysis. Experiments can be analyzed using Analytics charts, creating a unified workflow from hypothesis to statistical validation.

**Session Replay** complements Analytics by providing visual context to quantitative insights, allowing teams to see actual user interactions that drive the metrics measured in Analytics charts.

**Guides and Surveys** leverages Analytics data for targeting and uses the same event tracking infrastructure to measure engagement and effectiveness.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** orchestrates data flow across all products, managing ingestion, transformation, and activation through source and destination catalogs, audience management, and warehouse-native capabilities.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events and Properties**: Events represent discrete user actions tracked with structured data. Event properties provide contextual information about the action, while user properties describe persistent user characteristics that span sessions.

**User Identification System**: Implements a three-tier identification approach using device IDs for anonymous tracking, Amplitude IDs for cross-device user reconciliation, and user IDs for authenticated user identification.

**Sessions**: Time-bounded periods of user activity with configurable timeout periods (typically 5 minutes for mobile platforms, 30 minutes for web applications).

**Behavioral Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments based on shared behaviors or characteristics, enabling advanced targeting and comparative analysis across user groups.

**Autocapture**: Automated event tracking functionality that captures page views, clicks, form interactions, and other standard user behaviors without manual instrumentation.

**API Keys**: Project-specific identifiers that route events to correct Amplitude projects and control data access permissions across the platform.

**Tracking Plans**: Schema definitions within Amplitude Data that specify event structures, property types, validation rules, and governance policies for consistent data collection.

**Ampli**: Code generation tool that creates type-safe analytics implementations from Amplitude Data tracking plans, ensuring schema compliance and reducing implementation errors.

## SDK and Integration Ecosystem

The platform supports comprehensive data collection through multiple SDK implementations optimized for different development environments:

**Analytics SDKs**: Browser SDK, Android SDK, iOS SDK, React Native SDK, Flutter SDK, Node.js SDK, Python SDK, Java SDK, Go SDK, Unity SDK, and Unreal SDK, each providing platform-specific optimizations and feature sets.

**Experiment SDKs**: Feature flagging capabilities across all major platforms with consistent APIs for flag evaluation, experiment assignment, and exposure tracking.

**Storage and Privacy Options**: Configurable storage mechanisms including cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage, and cookieless implementations to accommodate various privacy requirements and technical constraints.

## API Endpoints and Integration Points

**Analytics APIs**:
- HTTP API v2: Event ingestion with deduplication capabilities (`/2/httpapi`)
- Identify API: User property updates and user profile management
- Dashboard REST API: Programmatic dashboard creation and management
- Export API: Bulk data extraction and analysis
- Behavioral Cohorts API: Segment creation and management
- Batch API: High-volume event processing

**Experiment APIs**:
- Feature flag evaluation endpoints for real-time flag resolution
- Experiment configuration management for test setup and modification
- Results retrieval APIs for statistical analysis and reporting

**Guides and Surveys API**:
- Campaign management and targeting configuration
- Response collection and analysis endpoints
- External system integration capabilities

## Command Line Interfaces

**Ampli CLI**:
- `ampli pull`: Downloads tracking plans from Amplitude Data and generates type-safe code libraries
- `ampli status`: Validates implementation compliance with defined tracking plans and identifies schema violations

## Data Management and Compliance Architecture

The platform implements comprehensive data governance with support for data residency requirements through US and EU server zones. GDPR and CCPA compliance features include PII management, data retention controls, user deletion capabilities, and privacy-focused configuration options.

**Attribution Models**: Support for first-touch, multi-touch, and custom attribution methodologies enabling sophisticated marketing campaign analysis and revenue attribution.

**Agent-Based Architecture**: Enables custom data processing, transformation workflows, and real-time data routing for advanced use cases.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management**: User provisioning, role-based access control (RBAC), and organization-level settings management with granular permission controls.

**Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Enterprise authentication integration supporting SAML and OAuth providers for centralized identity management.

**Billing and Usage Monitoring**: Real-time visibility into event volumes, user counts, feature utilization, and quota management across the platform.

## Broader Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates with extensive third-party platforms through its destination catalog, supports warehouse-native architectures for data teams using tools like dbt, and provides partner integrations for extended functionality. The platform's CDP capabilities enable data activation across marketing, product, and analytics tools while maintaining data consistency and governance.

The platform supports migration paths between SDK versions and maintains legacy chart compatibility for backward compatibility. Migration documentation covers API changes, configuration updates, and best practices for version transitions, ensuring smooth platform evolution without data loss or service interruption.
