# Amplitude Product Ontology and Summary

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with integrated tools for understanding user behavior, optimizing product experiences, and making data-driven decisions. The platform operates as a unified ecosystem of four core products built on event-based analytics infrastructure.

## Core Product Architecture

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational behavioral analytics engine, providing sophisticated event tracking, user segmentation, and analysis capabilities through multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Data Tables, and specialized charts like Stickiness, Lifecycle, and Revenue LTV. The platform supports both individual user-level and account-level reporting with advanced features for cohort analysis, anomaly detection, and collaborative analytics workflows.

**Amplitude Data** functions as the data governance and management layer, providing tracking plan creation, schema validation, data quality controls, and warehouse-native capabilities. It includes the Ampli code generation system that creates strongly-typed SDKs from tracking plans, ensuring implementation consistency and reducing errors through compile-time validation.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers comprehensive A/B testing and feature flagging capabilities with sophisticated targeting, statistical analysis, and traffic management features. The platform supports both traditional A/B tests and multi-armed bandit experiments, with advanced features like mutual exclusion groups, holdout groups, and sequential testing methodologies.

**Amplitude CDP (Customer Data Platform)** transforms user behavioral data into actionable insights through AI-powered segmentation, predictive analytics, and automated campaign targeting. It includes Audiences (now Activation) for personalization, real-time cohort syncing, and integration with external marketing platforms.

## Key Product Relationships and Integration Points

The products operate as an integrated ecosystem where data flows seamlessly between components. Analytics serves as the foundational data layer that feeds into Experiment for hypothesis-driven testing, while Data ensures proper governance and taxonomy across all products. The CDP leverages insights from Analytics to deliver targeted user experiences and captures additional behavioral data that enriches the overall dataset.

**Cross-Product Data Flow:**
- Event data collected through Analytics SDKs feeds into all other products
- Behavioral cohorts created in Analytics can be used for targeting in Experiment and activation in CDP
- Experiment results are analyzed using Analytics charts and statistical frameworks
- Data governance rules defined in Amplitude Data apply across all products

**Shared Infrastructure:**
- Unified authentication system across all products
- Common event schema and user identification framework
- Consistent API patterns and SDK implementations
- Integrated billing and usage tracking across the platform

## Comprehensive SDK and Integration Ecosystem

Amplitude provides extensive SDK coverage across 15+ platforms and languages:

**Client-Side SDKs:** Browser (JavaScript/TypeScript), Android (Kotlin/Java), iOS (Swift/Objective-C), React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal Engine
**Server-Side SDKs:** Node.js, Python, Java/JRE, Go, PHP, Ruby
**Specialized Tools:** Ampli CLI for code generation, Session Replay SDKs, Experiment SDKs

Each SDK implements consistent patterns for event tracking (`track()`), user identification (`identify()`), revenue tracking (`revenue()`), and group management (`setGroup()`), while providing platform-specific optimizations and compliance features.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Core Data Model:**
- **Events** - User actions tracked with properties and timestamps
- **User Properties** - Persistent attributes associated with users
- **Event Properties** - Contextual data attached to specific events
- **Amplitude ID** - Platform-generated unique identifier for cross-device tracking
- **Device ID** - Platform-specific identifiers (IDFV, UUID, advertising IDs)
- **Session ID** - Temporary identifier grouping related user activities

**Analytics Concepts:**
- **Behavioral Cohorts** - Dynamic user segments based on shared behaviors
- **MTU (Monthly Tracked Users)** - Primary billing metric for unique users per month
- **Funnel Analysis** - Sequential conversion tracking through defined user paths
- **Retention Analysis** - Measurement of user return behavior over time
- **Event Segmentation** - Primary analysis method for understanding user behavior patterns

**Experimentation Framework:**
- **Feature Flags** - Configuration-driven feature toggles for controlled rollouts
- **Variants** - Different versions of features being tested in experiments
- **Bucketing** - Consistent user assignment to experiment variants
- **Exposure Events** - Tracking when users encounter experiment variants
- **Statistical Significance** - Confidence levels in experiment results using T-tests or sequential testing

**Data Management:**
- **Tracking Plans** - Centralized schema definitions for events and properties
- **Transformations** - Query-time data modifications without affecting raw data
- **Derived Properties** - Formula-based property creation for data enrichment
- **Data Classification** - PII, sensitive, and revenue property categorization

## Advanced Analytics and Statistical Capabilities

The platform incorporates sophisticated analytical methodologies including:

**Statistical Analysis:** Welch's T-test implementation, CUPED variance reduction, Bonferroni correction for multiple hypothesis testing, sequential testing for continuous monitoring, and sample ratio mismatch detection.

**Machine Learning Features:** Prophet-based anomaly detection, AutoML clustering for Personas, predictive cohorts using transformer-based sequence models, and recommendation engines with hourly retraining cycles.

**Advanced Segmentation:** Cross-property analysis, behavioral clustering, predictive modeling, and real-time audience synchronization to external platforms.

- HTTP V2 API (`/2/httpapi`) - Primary event ingestion endpoint
- Batch Event Upload API - Bulk data processing with 20MB limits
- Identify API (`/identify`) - User property management
- Attribution API (`/attribution`) - Mobile attribution event processing

**Data Access APIs:**
- Export API (`/api/2/export`) - Bulk event data extraction
- Dashboard REST API - Structured access to analytics insights
- User Profile API - Individual user profile retrieval
- Behavioral Cohorts API - Segment export/import capabilities

**Management APIs:**
