Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with behavioral analytics, feature experimentation, customer data management, and user engagement tools. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products designed to support data-driven decision making across the entire customer lifecycle.

## Core Product Architecture

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, offering sophisticated behavioral analysis through multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Cohort Analysis, and Revenue LTV tracking. The analytics platform supports real-time event tracking, user journey mapping, and advanced segmentation capabilities.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced statistical analysis, supporting both client-side and server-side experimentation workflows. The platform includes experiment theory documentation, advanced techniques, troubleshooting guides, and comprehensive results analysis tools.

**Amplitude CDP (Customer Data Platform)** enables unified customer data management through extensive source and destination integrations, audience building, and data governance capabilities including PII management and warehouse-native implementations.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user session recordings to provide qualitative insights complementing quantitative behavioral data.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** facilitates in-product user engagement through guided experiences and feedback collection mechanisms.

## Chart Types and Analytics Capabilities

The platform offers specialized chart types for different analytical use cases:

**Event Segmentation** (`/analytics/charts/event-segmentation/`) provides fundamental event analysis with property breakdowns, filtering, and comparative analysis across user segments.

**Funnel Analysis** (`/analytics/charts/funnel-analysis/`) tracks conversion rates through multi-step user journeys, identifying drop-off points and optimization opportunities.

**Retention Analysis** (`/analytics/charts/retention-analysis/`) measures user return behavior over time, supporting cohort-based retention tracking and churn analysis.

**User Sessions** (`/analytics/charts/user-sessions/`) analyzes session-based metrics including session duration, depth, and engagement patterns.

**Journeys** (`/analytics/charts/journeys/`) maps complete user pathways through products, revealing common navigation patterns and user flow optimization opportunities.

**Personas** (`/analytics/charts/personas/`) creates behavioral user segments based on event patterns and property combinations.

**Compass** (`/analytics/charts/compass/`) provides strategic metric tracking and goal monitoring capabilities.

**Lifecycle** (`/analytics/charts/lifecycle/`) tracks user progression through defined lifecycle stages from acquisition to retention.

**Stickiness** (`/analytics/charts/stickiness/`) measures user engagement frequency and product adoption depth.

**Revenue LTV** (`/analytics/charts/revenue-ltv/`) calculates customer lifetime value and revenue attribution across user segments.

**Impact Analysis** (`/analytics/charts/impact-analysis/`) quantifies the business impact of product changes and feature releases.

**Engagement Matrix** (`/analytics/charts/engagement-matrix/`) visualizes user engagement patterns across multiple dimensions.

**Data Tables** (`/analytics/charts/data-tables/`) provides raw data exploration and custom metric calculation capabilities.

**Experiment Results** (`/analytics/charts/experiment-results/`) analyzes A/B test performance with statistical significance testing and confidence intervals.

## SDK and Integration Ecosystem

Amplitude provides comprehensive SDK coverage across platforms and programming languages:

**Client-Side SDKs** include Browser SDK (`/sdks/analytics/browser/`), Android SDK (`/sdks/analytics/android/`), iOS SDK (`/sdks/analytics/ios/`), React Native SDK (`/sdks/analytics/react-native/`), Flutter SDK (`/sdks/analytics/flutter/`), Unity SDK (`/sdks/analytics/unity/`), and Unreal SDK (`/sdks/analytics/unreal/`).

**Server-Side SDKs** support Node.js (`/sdks/analytics/node/`), Python (`/sdks/analytics-sdks/python/`), Java (`/sdks/analytics/java/`), and Go (`/sdks/analytics/go/`) for backend event tracking and data processing.

**Ampli** (`/sdks/ampli/`) provides type-safe analytics implementation with code generation and schema validation across multiple programming languages.

**Experiment SDKs** (`/sdks/experiment-sdks/`) enable feature flag evaluation and experiment assignment across client and server environments.

## API Infrastructure

The platform exposes comprehensive APIs for programmatic access:

**Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/`) enables event ingestion, user property management, and data export capabilities.

**Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) support feature flag management, experiment configuration, and results retrieval.

**Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) facilitates programmatic management of in-product experiences and feedback collection.

## Data Management and Integration

**Source Catalog** (`/data/source-catalog/`) provides 60+ integrations for data ingestion from marketing platforms, attribution providers, customer data platforms, data warehouses, and business applications.

**Destination Catalog** (`/data/destination-catalog/`) enables data activation through integrations with marketing automation, personalization engines, and business intelligence tools.

**Audiences** (`/data/audiences/`) supports behavioral cohort creation and export for targeted marketing and personalization campaigns.

**Warehouse-native Amplitude** (`/data/warehouse-native/`) enables analytics directly on existing data warehouse infrastructure without data movement.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** (`/admin/account-management/`) provides user provisioning, role-based access control, and organizational hierarchy management.

**Single Sign-on** (`/admin/single-sign-on/`) supports SAML and OAuth integration with enterprise identity providers.

**Billing and Use** (`/admin/billing-use/`) offers usage monitoring, quota management, and billing administration capabilities.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** represent discrete user actions or system occurrences tracked within Amplitude, containing properties that provide contextual information.

**User Properties** are attributes associated with individual users that persist across sessions and events.

**Cohorts** are user segments defined by behavioral patterns, demographic characteristics, or custom criteria.

**Feature Flags** enable controlled feature rollouts and experimentation through dynamic configuration management.

**Attribution Windows** define time periods for associating user actions with marketing touchpoints or experimental treatments.

**Behavioral Cohorts** represent user segments created based on specific event patterns and engagement behaviors.

**Mirror Sync vs Append Only** describes data synchronization strategies where Mirror Sync replicates exact source state while Append Only continuously adds new records.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The platform operates as an integrated ecosystem where analytics data informs experimentation decisions, experiment results drive product iterations, and customer data flows seamlessly between components. Session Replay provides qualitative context for quantitative analytics insights, while Guides and Surveys enable direct user feedback collection within the product experience.

Route patterns follow consistent structures: `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/`, `/sdks/{platform}/{language}/`, `/apis/{product}/`, `/data/{capability}/`, and `/admin/{function}/`, providing logical organization across the comprehensive product suite.

The platform supports multi-site deployment with English (`en`) and Japanese (`jp`) localization, enterprise-grade security controls, and flexible deployment options including cloud-hosted and warehouse-native implementations.
