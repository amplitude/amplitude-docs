# Amplitude Digital Analytics and Experimentation Platform

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides product analytics, feature experimentation, customer data management, and user engagement tools. The platform serves product teams, developers, marketers, and data analysts with integrated solutions for understanding user behavior, running experiments, and optimizing digital experiences.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem consists of four core product areas that work together through shared data infrastructure:

**Analytics Core** - The foundational product analytics platform featuring multiple chart types (Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Personas, Stickiness, Compass, Data Tables, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, Revenue LTV) and legacy chart support. Analytics integrates with all other products through shared event data and user identification.

**Amplitude Experiment** - Feature flagging and A/B testing platform with advanced statistical analysis, including experiment theory, workflow management, results analysis, troubleshooting tools, and "under the hood" technical implementation details. Experiment leverages Analytics data for user segmentation and measurement.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** - Data infrastructure including sources, destinations, audiences, warehouse-native capabilities, and PII management. The CDP serves as the data backbone connecting all products and external systems.

**Amplitude Session Replay** - User session recording and analysis tool that captures user interactions for qualitative analysis, complementing quantitative analytics data.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** - User engagement platform for in-product messaging, onboarding flows, and feedback collection.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Collections** - Content organization structure using YAML configuration files that define routing (`route`), navigation injection (`inject.nav_title`), mounting relationships (`mount`), site propagation (`sites`, `propagate`), and content structure (`structure.root`).

**SDKs (Software Development Kits)** - Client libraries for data collection across platforms including Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine. Each SDK collection uses standardized routing patterns like `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/{slug}`.

**APIs** - RESTful interfaces for Analytics, Experiment, and Guides and Surveys with dedicated endpoint documentation under `/apis/{product}/{slug}` routing.

**Ampli** - Code generation tool that creates type-safe tracking libraries from Amplitude Data tracking plans, available across multiple programming languages and platforms.

**Mounting System** - Content management architecture using unique identifiers (UUIDs) to link collections, enabling content reuse and hierarchical organization.

**Navigation Injection** - Systematic content categorization using `nav_title` values like `analytics`, `experiment`, `data`, `apis`, `analytics_sdks`, `experiment_sdks` for consistent site navigation.

**Blade System** - Product branding mechanism that applies specific product context (e.g., "Amplitude Experiment", "Amplitude Session Replay", "Amplitude Guides and Surveys") to content sections.

## Content Management and Routing Architecture

The platform uses a sophisticated content management system with hierarchical routing:

**Root-Level Sections** (`/`) - Primary product areas and getting started content

**Product-Specific Routes** - Dedicated paths for each product area:
- Analytics: `/analytics/{slug}` and `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/{slug}`
- Experiment: `/feature-experiment/{slug}` with specialized paths for theory, workflow, advanced techniques, and troubleshooting
- Data/CDP: `/data/{slug}` with specialized paths for sources, audiences, destinations, and warehouse-native features
- APIs: `/apis/{product}/{slug}`
- SDKs: `/sdks/{product}/{platform}/{slug}`

**Administrative Content** - Account management (`/admin/account-management/{slug}`), billing (`/admin/billing-use/{slug}`), and single sign-on (`/admin/single-sign-on/{slug}`)

**Support Infrastructure** - FAQ and troubleshooting (`/faq/{slug}`), migration guides (`/migration/{slug}`), and partner documentation (`/partners/{slug}`)

## API Endpoints and Technical Integration

**Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/{slug}`) - RESTful endpoints for event ingestion, user properties, cohort management, and data export

**Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/{slug}`) - Feature flag management, experiment configuration, variant assignment, and results retrieval

**Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/{slug}`) - In-product messaging, survey creation, response collection, and targeting management

**SDK Integration Patterns** - Standardized initialization, event tracking, user identification, and configuration across all client libraries with platform-specific implementation details

## Broader Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates with the broader marketing and product technology stack through:

**Source Catalog** - Pre-built integrations for data ingestion from various platforms, organized by integration categories and accessible via `/data/source-catalog/{slug}`

**Destination Catalog** - Data export integrations to external systems, marketing tools, and data warehouses via `/data/destination-catalog/{slug}`

**Partner Ecosystem** - Third-party integrations and certified partner solutions documented under `/partners/{slug}`

**Warehouse-Native Architecture** - Direct integration with cloud data warehouses, enabling analysis without data movement

**PII Management** - Privacy-compliant data handling with specialized integrations for sensitive data processing

The platform supports multi-language documentation (English and Japanese), comprehensive troubleshooting resources, migration tooling for platform transitions, and extensive educational content through Academy materials. The architecture emphasizes developer experience through comprehensive SDK documentation, API references, and integration guides while providing business users with detailed feature documentation and best practices.
