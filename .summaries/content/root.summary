# Amplitude Product Suite Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that helps organizations understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive business growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of several interconnected products and features designed to collect, analyze, and act on user interaction data.

## Core Products and Features

### Analytics and Visualization
- **Charts**: A comprehensive suite of visualization tools for analyzing user behavior, including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, and specialized charts like Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, and Compass.
- **Journeys**: Path analysis tools (Pathfinder and Journey Map) that visualize how users navigate through products, showing conversion patterns and user behavior flows.
- **Data Tables**: Multi-dimensional analysis feature for comparing metrics across different dimensions, with specialized capabilities for marketing attribution and session analysis.

### Data Management
- **Data**: A comprehensive data governance platform for defining, tracking, verifying, and improving analytics data quality, including tracking plans, validation, and transformation capabilities.
- **Ampli**: Type-safe SDK wrappers generated from tracking plans to reduce implementation errors.
- **Session Replay**: Captures user sessions for visual playback and analysis.

### Experimentation
- **Experiment**: A platform for designing, running, and analyzing A/B tests with statistical rigor, including:
  - Statistical analysis using Welch's T-test methodology
  - Experiment design tools like Duration Estimator
  - Support for A/B Testing and Multi-Armed Bandit experiments

### User Segmentation and Management
- **Audiences**: Tools for creating and analyzing behavioral cohorts based on user actions.
- **Personas**: Clusters users based on similar behaviors for targeted analysis.
- **User Profile API**: Accesses user properties and recommendations.

### APIs and Integration
- **API Suite**: Comprehensive set of APIs for programmatic interaction with the platform:
  - Event Ingestion APIs (HTTP V2, Batch Upload)
  - Data Retrieval APIs (Dashboard REST, Export)
  - Data Management APIs (Taxonomy, Lookup Table)
  - Privacy and Compliance APIs (User Privacy, CCPA DSAR)

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Data Structure
- **Events**: User actions tracked in Amplitude (limited to 2000 event types per project)
- **Properties**:
  - **Event Properties**: Attributes of specific events
  - **User Properties**: Attributes of users that persist across events
  - **Group Properties**: Attributes of organizational groups

### Identity Management
- **User ID**: Custom identifier for logged-in users
- **Device ID**: Identifier for devices (IDFV on iOS by default)
- **Amplitude ID**: Amplitude's internal user identifier

### Analysis Concepts
- **Sessions**: Series of user events grouped by time proximity (default 30-minute timeout)
- **Cohorts**: Groups of users defined by behavioral criteria
- **Attribution Models**: Methods for distributing credit across marketing touchpoints
- **Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE)**: Smallest meaningful change an experiment aims to detect

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude platform is designed as an integrated ecosystem where data flows between products:

1. **Data Collection Layer**:
   - SDKs for various platforms (JavaScript, iOS, Android, etc.)
   - HTTP APIs for real-time and batch data ingestion
   - Third-party integrations (Segment, etc.)

2. **Data Management Layer**:
   - Tracking Plans define events and properties
   - Data validation ensures quality
   - Transformations modify data retroactively

3. **Analytics Layer**:
   - Charts visualize user behavior
   - Segmentation identifies user groups
   - Journeys map user paths

4. **Experimentation Layer**:
   - Experiment design and targeting
   - Statistical analysis of results
   - Feature flagging capabilities

5. **Integration Layer**:
   - Event streaming to external tools
   - Cohort synchronization with marketing platforms
   - Data warehouse connections

## Technical Implementation

### API Endpoints
- Event Ingestion: `https://api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`
- Batch Upload: `https://api2.amplitude.com/batch`
- Export API: `https://amplitude.com/api/2/export`
- Dashboard REST API: `https://amplitude.com/api/2/events/segmentation`

### SDK Implementation
```javascript
// JavaScript SDK initialization
amplitude.getInstance().init("API_KEY", null, {
  flushIntervalMillis: 1000,
  eventUploadThreshold: 30
});

// Tracking an event
amplitude.getInstance().logEvent("Event Name", {
  property1: "value1",
  property2: "value2"
});
```

### Ampli CLI Commands
- `ampli pull`: Pull tracking plan changes
- `ampli status`: Check status of local tracking plan

The Amplitude platform offers various subscription tiers including Free, Plus, Growth, and Enterprise plans, with advanced features like Behavioral Cohorts, Pathfinder, and Data Tables available in higher tiers.
