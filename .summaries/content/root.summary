Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform integrates analytics, experimentation, session replay, user engagement tools, and customer data management into a unified ecosystem.

## Core Product Architecture and Relationships

**Amplitude Analytics** forms the platform's foundation, providing behavioral analysis through multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Stickiness, Lifecycle, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Revenue LTV, and Experiment Results. These visualization tools enable comprehensive user behavior analysis through cohort segmentation, conversion tracking, and user journey mapping.

**Amplitude Experiment** integrates directly with the analytics engine to deliver feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities. It encompasses advanced experimentation techniques, statistical analysis, workflow management, and both client-side and server-side implementation options with real-time results visualization.

**Session Replay** captures granular user interactions to provide qualitative context for quantitative analytics data, helping teams understand the underlying reasons for behaviors identified through charts and funnels.

**Guides and Surveys** leverages analytics data for targeted in-product user experience optimization, delivering contextual guidance, collecting user feedback, and providing help resources based on user behavior patterns.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** orchestrates data flow across the ecosystem through source and destination catalogs, audience management, transformation pipelines, and warehouse-native capabilities for organizations preferring to maintain data in their own infrastructure.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Events** represent tracked user actions and form the fundamental data unit across all platform capabilities. Events contain properties that provide contextual metadata about user interactions and system states.

**Cohorts** define user segments based on shared characteristics or behaviors, enabling targeted experimentation, personalized experiences, and comparative analysis across user groups.

**Funnels** measure user progression through sequential event flows, calculating conversion rates and identifying optimization opportunities at each step.

**Retention** quantifies user return behavior over specified time periods, typically measuring the percentage of users who perform target actions within defined windows.

**Amplitude IDs** serve as persistent unique user identifiers that maintain continuity across sessions, devices, and platforms for accurate cross-platform user tracking.

**Feature Flags** control application feature visibility and behavior, enabling gradual rollouts, experimentation, and instant feature toggling without requiring code deployments.

**Variants** represent different feature or experience versions within experiments, allowing simultaneous testing of multiple approaches with statistical comparison.

**Statistical Significance** indicates confidence levels that observed differences between experiment variants exceed random variation thresholds.

## SDK and API Infrastructure

The platform provides extensive SDK coverage across development environments:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal implementations. Each SDK handles event tracking, user identification, and configuration management with platform-specific performance optimizations.

**Experiment SDKs** deliver feature flag evaluation and experiment assignment across the same platform coverage, supporting local evaluation for reduced latency and improved performance.

**Ampli** generates type-safe analytics code based on tracking plans, ensuring data consistency and quality across development teams while reducing implementation errors.

**API Infrastructure** includes:
- Analytics API (`/api/2/httpapi`) for server-side event ingestion
- Export API (`/api/1/export`) for data extraction
- Experiment API (`/sdk/vardata`) for feature flag evaluation
- Guides and Surveys API for experience management

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates with hundreds of third-party platforms through comprehensive **Source** and **Destination Catalogs**, enabling data collection from diverse sources and activation across marketing, product, and analytics tools. The platform supports real-time streaming, batch processing, and warehouse-native architectures.

**Data Management** capabilities encompass PII handling, governance frameworks, audience creation and syndication, and warehouse-native deployment options for organizations requiring data residency control.

**Administrative Infrastructure** includes account management, billing and usage monitoring, SSO integration, granular user permissions, and organizational configuration management.

**Migration Tools** facilitate platform transitions with data mapping utilities, implementation guidance, and best practice documentation for organizations moving from competing analytics platforms.

The platform serves multiple organizational roles: product managers analyzing user behavior patterns, engineers implementing tracking and experimentation infrastructure, data analysts creating insights and reports, marketers optimizing campaigns and user experiences, and executives monitoring business metrics and growth indicators.

**Educational Resources** include Academy training content, certification programs, comprehensive FAQ documentation, and troubleshooting guides to support implementation and operational success.

Amplitude's documentation architecture reflects its enterprise-grade positioning, requiring comprehensive technical implementation guidance spanning initial instrumentation through advanced experimentation workflows and data activation strategies across complex organizational technology stacks.
