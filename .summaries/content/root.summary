Amplitude is a comprehensive behavioral analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with deep insights into user behavior, product performance, and feature effectiveness. The platform consists of four core products: Analytics for behavioral insights, Experiment for feature flagging and A/B testing, Session Replay for user experience analysis, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP) for unified data management.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The platform operates through an interconnected ecosystem where **Analytics** serves as the foundational layer, processing behavioral events through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Personas, Stickiness, Revenue LTV, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, and Data Tables. Each chart type provides specialized analytical capabilities, from basic event tracking to complex user journey mapping and revenue attribution.

**Amplitude Experiment** integrates deeply with the analytics layer, providing feature flagging, A/B testing, and experimentation capabilities. It includes advanced techniques, experiment theory, workflow management, and comprehensive result analysis through dedicated experiment results charts. The platform supports both client-side and server-side experimentation with sophisticated targeting and statistical analysis.

**Session Replay** captures and analyzes user interactions, providing visual insights into user behavior patterns that complement the quantitative data from analytics charts.

The **Customer Data Platform (CDP)** unifies data ingestion through extensive source and destination catalogs, audience management, and warehouse-native capabilities, supporting over 60 integrations across marketing, attribution, engagement, and data storage platforms.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Events and Properties**: The fundamental data structure where events represent user actions and properties provide contextual metadata. Events follow naming conventions with platform-specific prefixes like "[HubSpot]" or "[Braze]" for source identification.

**User Identity Resolution**: The process of connecting user interactions across devices and platforms using various identifiers including user_id, device_id, amplitudeDeviceId, and customerUserId for unified user journey tracking.

**Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments based on behavioral criteria that can be created in Analytics and exported to external platforms for activation in marketing campaigns and personalization engines.

**Feature Flags and Variants**: Experiment configuration elements where flags control feature visibility and variants define different user experiences within experiments, supporting both boolean flags and multi-variant testing.

**Attribution Windows**: Time-based parameters (typically 72 hours) used for connecting advertising touchpoints with conversion events, particularly important for mobile attribution tracking.

**Change Data Capture (CDC)**: Real-time data synchronization methodology that captures database changes as they occur, primarily used in warehouse integrations like Snowflake.

**Advertising ID Matching**: Identity resolution using device identifiers (IDFA for iOS, ADID for Android) to connect attribution events with behavioral data.

## Analytics Chart Ecosystem

The analytics platform provides specialized chart types for different analytical use cases:

**Event Segmentation** serves as the primary tool for measuring event volumes, user counts, and property analysis with advanced segmentation capabilities.

**Funnel Analysis** tracks user progression through defined sequences, measuring conversion rates and identifying drop-off points in user journeys.

**Retention Analysis** measures user return behavior over time, supporting cohort-based retention tracking and churn analysis.

**User Sessions** analyzes session-based metrics including session duration, events per session, and session-based user behavior patterns.

**Journeys** provides comprehensive user path analysis, showing how users navigate through products and identifying common behavioral patterns.

**Revenue LTV** focuses on monetization analytics, tracking revenue attribution, lifetime value calculations, and subscription metrics.

**Personas** enables behavioral segmentation based on user actions and properties, creating dynamic user classifications for targeted analysis.

## Experimentation and Feature Management

**Amplitude Experiment** provides comprehensive A/B testing and feature flagging capabilities through multiple components:

**Workflow Management** covers the complete experimentation lifecycle from hypothesis formation through result analysis and implementation decisions.

**Advanced Techniques** include sophisticated targeting, statistical methodologies, and complex experiment designs like multi-armed bandits and sequential testing.

**Experiment Theory** encompasses statistical foundations, power analysis, significance testing, and experimental design principles.

**Under the Hood** details the technical implementation of experiment assignment, bucketing algorithms, and data collection methodologies.

## SDK and API Architecture

The platform supports extensive instrumentation through multiple SDK categories:

**Analytics SDKs** include platform-specific implementations for Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal, each optimized for their respective environments.

**Experiment SDKs** provide feature flagging and experiment assignment capabilities across the same platform spectrum, enabling consistent experimentation across all user touchpoints.

**Ampli** serves as a type-safe wrapper that provides strongly-typed event tracking, ensuring data quality and consistency across implementations.

**API Endpoints** include:
- Analytics API for event ingestion and data export
- Experiment APIs for flag management and assignment
- Attribution API for mobile attribution data processing
- Guides and Surveys API for in-product messaging

## Data Integration and CDP Capabilities

The **Source Catalog** encompasses over 60 integrations across multiple categories:

**Marketing Attribution** platforms (AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch, Singular) integrate via the Attribution API with advertising ID matching and attribution window processing.

**Data Warehouses** (Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks) support sophisticated ETL operations including Change Data Capture, Mirror Sync, and Timestamp-based imports.

**Marketing Automation** platforms (HubSpot, Mailchimp, Braze, SendGrid) stream engagement events with platform-specific prefixes and real-time webhook delivery.

**Cloud Storage** integrations (Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage) provide file-based ingestion supporting JSON, CSV, and Parquet formats.

The **Destination Catalog** enables data activation by exporting behavioral data, cohorts, and insights to external platforms for marketing activation, personalization, and business intelligence.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** provides organization-level controls, user permissions, and access management across all platform features.

**Single Sign-On** supports enterprise authentication requirements with SAML and OAuth integration capabilities.

**Billing and Use** tracking provides usage monitoring, plan management, and cost optimization tools for enterprise deployments.

## Additional Product Capabilities

**Guides and Surveys** enables in-product messaging, user onboarding flows, and feedback collection with API-driven content management.

**Session Replay** captures user interactions for qualitative analysis, providing visual context to complement quantitative behavioral data.

**Partners** ecosystem extends platform capabilities through certified integrations and specialized implementation services.

The platform operates with regional compliance support including EU data residency for GDPR requirements, comprehensive data governance controls, and enterprise-grade security features. Route structures follow RESTful patterns with platform-specific endpoints like `/analytics/{slug}`, `/feature-experiment/{slug}`, and `/sdks/{platform}/{slug}` for organized documentation and API access.
