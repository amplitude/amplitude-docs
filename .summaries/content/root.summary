# Amplitude Documentation Platform

## Product Overview

The Amplitude Documentation Platform is a comprehensive content management system designed to organize and deliver product documentation for Amplitude's suite of products. The platform covers analytics, experimentation, data management, and developer tools through a structured collection-based architecture.

Key features of the platform include:
- Organized documentation collections representing different product areas
- Support for multiple content types (guides, references, SDK docs, troubleshooting)
- Multi-product coverage across Analytics, Experiment, Data, and Session Replay
- Extensive SDK documentation for multiple platforms and languages
- API reference documentation for various Amplitude services
- Chart-specific guidance for analytics visualization
- Educational resources and implementation guides
- Multilingual support with primary focus on English and Japanese
- Administrative and account management documentation

## Product Relationships and Structure

The documentation is organized into several major product areas that reflect Amplitude's product ecosystem:

### Analytics Platform
The core analytics functionality is documented in `analytics.yaml`, with specialized collections for different chart types and visualization tools:
- Event segmentation, funnel analysis, and retention analysis
- Data visualization tools like Compass and data tables
- User behavior analysis including user sessions, journeys, and lifecycle

### Experiment Platform
Amplitude's experimentation capabilities are documented across multiple collections:
- Core experimentation features (`experiment.yaml`)
- Implementation guides for various platforms (`experiment-sdks.yaml`)
- API documentation (`experiment-apis.yaml`)
- Theoretical foundations (`experiment-theory.yaml`)
- Advanced topics and workflows (`under-the-hood.yaml`, `workflow.yaml`)
- Troubleshooting resources (`experiment_troubleshooting.yaml`)

### Data Management
Data-related documentation covers:
- Data sources configuration (`sources.yaml`, `source-catalog.yaml`)
- Data destinations (`destination-catalog.yaml`)
- Audience management (`audiences.yaml`)
- PII handling (`pii_integrations.yaml`)
- Customer Data Platform functionality (`cdp.yaml`)

### Developer Resources
Extensive SDK documentation spans multiple platforms:
- Web: Browser SDK (`browser_sdk.yaml`)
- Mobile: iOS (`ios_sdk.yaml`), Android (`android_sdk.yaml`)
- Cross-platform: React Native (`react_native_sdk.yaml`), Flutter (`flutter_sdk.yaml`)
- Server-side: Node.js (`node_js_sdk.yaml`), Python (`python_sdk.yaml`), Java (`java_sdk.yaml`), Go (`go_sdk.yaml`)
- Game engines: Unity (`unity_sdk.yaml`), Unreal (`unreal_sdk.yaml`)

Additional developer resources include:
- Ampli toolkit documentation (`ampli.yaml`)
- API references (`api.yaml`, `apis.yaml`)
- Instrumentation guides (`instrumentation.yaml`)

### Additional Products
- Session Replay functionality (`session-replay.yaml`)
- Guides and Surveys features (`guides_and_surveys.yaml`, `guides_and_surveys_api.yaml`)

### Administrative Content
- Account management (`account-management.yaml`)
- Billing information (`billing-use.yaml`)
- Single sign-on configuration (`single-sign-on.yaml`)

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

The documentation platform uses several key concepts:

**Collections**: Content groupings organized by product area, feature, or content type. Each collection is defined in a YAML file that specifies its properties and behavior.

**Mount Points**: References to specific entry points that serve as the root for a collection's content structure.

**Routes**: URL patterns defining how content is accessed, following patterns like:
- `/analytics/{slug}` for analytics documentation
- `/feature-experiment/{slug}` for experiment documentation
- `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/{slug}` for SDK documentation
- `/apis/{product}/{slug}` for API documentation
- `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/{slug}` for chart-specific documentation

**Date Behavior**: Rules determining content visibility based on publication dates:
```yaml
date_behavior:
  past: public
  future: private
```

**Preview Targets**: Configuration for content preview functionality:
```yaml
preview_targets:
  - label: Entry
    url: '{permalink}'
    refresh: true
```

**Nav Title Injection**: Custom navigation labels applied to content sections:
```yaml
inject:
  nav_title: analytics
```

**Structure Root**: Boolean setting that determines if a collection appears at the root level of navigation.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The documentation platform integrates with Amplitude's broader product ecosystem in several ways:

1. **Analytics Integration**: Documentation covers the full analytics workflow from data collection to visualization and analysis.

2. **Experiment Integration**: Comprehensive documentation for A/B testing and feature flag capabilities, including implementation guides and theoretical foundations.

3. **Data Platform Integration**: Documentation for the data infrastructure that powers Amplitude's products, including sources, destinations, and management tools.

4. **Developer Tools Integration**: SDK documentation across multiple platforms supports implementation in various technical environments.

5. **Cross-Product Features**: Documentation for features that span multiple products, such as account management and single sign-on.

The platform uses a consistent URL structure to organize content by product area, with specialized routing patterns for different content types:
- Product documentation: `/[product]/{slug}`
- SDK documentation: `/sdks/[product]/[platform]/{slug}`
- API documentation: `/apis/[product]/{slug}`
- Chart documentation: `/analytics/charts/[chart-type]/{slug}`

This structure reflects the relationships between Amplitude's products and provides a coherent navigation experience for users seeking information about specific features or implementation approaches.
