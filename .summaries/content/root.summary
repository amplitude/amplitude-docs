Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products that span analytics, experimentation, customer data management, and user engagement.

## Core Product Architecture

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, offering sophisticated event tracking and behavioral analysis through multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, Revenue LTV, and Experiment Results. Each chart type provides specialized analytical capabilities for different aspects of user behavior analysis.

**Amplitude Experiment** is the feature flagging and A/B testing platform that enables controlled rollouts and experimentation. It includes advanced techniques for statistical analysis, experiment theory foundations, workflow management, and comprehensive troubleshooting capabilities. The platform supports both client-side and server-side experimentation with sophisticated targeting and statistical analysis.

**Amplitude CDP (Customer Data Platform)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and distribution through Sources, Destinations, Audiences, and warehouse-native capabilities. The platform includes extensive source and destination catalogs with integration categories, PII handling, and real-time data processing.

**Amplitude Session Replay** provides visual user session recordings and analysis capabilities for understanding user interactions and identifying optimization opportunities.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** delivers in-product user engagement through contextual messaging, feedback collection, and onboarding experiences.

## Multi-Platform SDK Ecosystem

The platform supports comprehensive instrumentation through dedicated SDKs across all major platforms:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser SDK, Android SDK, iOS SDK, React Native SDK, Flutter SDK, Unity SDK, Unreal SDK, Node.js SDK, Java SDK, Go SDK, and Python SDK. Each SDK provides consistent APIs for event tracking, user identification, and behavioral analysis.

**Experiment SDKs** offer feature flag evaluation and experiment participation across the same platform spectrum, with specialized APIs for flag evaluation, variant assignment, and exposure tracking.

**Ampli** serves as a type-safe wrapper that generates strongly-typed tracking libraries based on your tracking plan, ensuring data quality and consistency across implementations.

**Framework Integrations** provide specialized support for popular development frameworks, simplifying implementation and reducing integration complexity.

## API Infrastructure

The platform exposes comprehensive REST APIs for programmatic access:

**Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/`) enables data export, custom analysis, and integration with external systems.

**Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) provide programmatic control over feature flags, experiments, and variant management.

**Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) allows automated management of in-product messaging campaigns.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** are discrete user actions tracked within applications, forming the foundation of all analytics.

**Properties** are attributes associated with events or users that provide context and enable segmentation.

**Cohorts** and **Audiences** represent user segments based on behavioral or demographic criteria.

**Funnels** track user progression through defined sequences of events.

**Retention** measures user return behavior over specified time periods.

**Experiments** are controlled tests comparing different user experiences to measure impact.

**Feature Flags** enable dynamic control over application functionality without code deployments.

**Sources** are data ingestion points that send events to Amplitude.

**Destinations** are external systems that receive processed data from Amplitude.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** provides organizational structure, user permissions, and access control.

**Single Sign-On** enables enterprise authentication integration.

**Billing and Use** tracks platform usage and manages subscription limits.

The platform includes comprehensive **FAQ and Troubleshooting** resources, **Migration** tools for transitioning from other analytics platforms, and **Academy Content** for user education.

## Internationalization and Accessibility

The platform supports **Japanese Translation** with localized content and region-specific features. Multi-site architecture enables content propagation and regional customization.

## Partner Ecosystem

Amplitude maintains an extensive **Partners** program with integrations across analytics, marketing, and development tools, enabling seamless data flow and workflow integration.

## Content Management System

The documentation utilizes a sophisticated collection-based content management system with hierarchical organization, URL routing patterns, preview capabilities, and injection-based metadata management. Collections support mounting for content reuse, taxonomies for categorization, and site-specific propagation for multi-regional deployment.

The platform's architecture enables organizations to implement comprehensive product analytics, run sophisticated experiments, manage customer data flows, and engage users through personalized experiences, all while maintaining enterprise-grade security, scalability, and administrative control.
