   - PII handling and integration

4. **SDKs** - Client and server libraries for data collection
   - Browser SDK for web applications
   - Mobile SDKs (iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter)
   - Server SDKs (Node.js, Python, Java, Go)
   - Gaming SDKs (Unity, Unreal)
   - Ampli wrapper for type-safe implementation

5. **APIs**

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: A discrete user action or system occurrence tracked in Amplitude
- **User Properties**: Attributes associated with users (demographics, preferences)
- **Session**: A period of continuous user engagement with an application
- **Funnel**: A series of events representing a conversion path
- **Retention**: Measurement of user return rates over time
- **Cohort**: A group of users sharing common characteristics or behaviors
- **Experiment**: A controlled test comparing different variations of a feature
- **Source**: An origin point for data collection
- **Destination**: A system where Amplitude sends processed data
- **Ampli**: A code generation tool creating type-safe wrappers for tracking plans

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's platform components work together in an integrated workflow:

1. **Data Collection Flow**:
   - SDKs collect user interaction data across platforms
   - Events are transmitted to Amplitude via HTTP APIs
   - Ampli ensures data quality through type-safe tracking

2. **Analysis and Visualization**:
   - Collected data populates Analytics dashboards and charts
   - Various visualization tools provide insights into user behavior
   - Compass offers guided analysis of key metrics

3. **Experimentation Workflow**:
   - Experiment platform leverages collected data for test evaluation
   - Experiment SDKs manage feature flag delivery and user assignment
   - Impact Analysis quantifies experiment effects on key metrics

4. **Data Management and Integration**:
   - Source Catalog manages incoming data connections
   - Destination Catalog handles outgoing data connections
   - CDP enables real-time audience syncing with marketing tools
