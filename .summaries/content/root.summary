Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive data-driven decision making through integrated analytics, experimentation, and customer data management capabilities.

## Product Architecture and Core Components

The platform consists of four primary product areas that work together as an integrated ecosystem:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational behavioral analytics engine, providing real-time event tracking and analysis through a comprehensive suite of chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Revenue LTV, Personas, Journeys, Compass, Data Tables, Impact Analysis, and Engagement Matrix. Each chart type addresses specific analytical use cases from basic event counting to complex behavioral cohort analysis.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities through advanced statistical analysis, supporting both client-side and server-side experimentation with sophisticated targeting rules, statistical significance calculations, and automated result interpretation through dedicated Experiment Results charts.

**Amplitude Data** functions as the central data governance and orchestration layer, managing tracking plans, schema validation, data transformations, and integrations across the entire data lifecycle through tools like Ampli code generation and comprehensive source/destination catalogs.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and reconstructs user sessions for qualitative analysis, enabling teams to understand the "why" behind quantitative behavioral patterns through visual session playback and analysis.

## SDK and Integration Ecosystem

The platform supports comprehensive instrumentation through multiple SDK implementations:

**Client-side SDKs**: Browser SDK (`/sdks/analytics/browser/`), Android SDK (`/sdks/analytics/android/`), iOS SDK (`/sdks/analytics/ios/`), React Native SDK (`/sdks/analytics/react-native/`), Flutter SDK (`/sdks/analytics/flutter/`), Unity SDK (`/sdks/analytics/unity/`), and Unreal SDK (`/sdks/analytics/unreal/`)

**Server-side SDKs**: Node.js SDK (`/sdks/analytics/node/`), Python SDK (`/sdks/analytics-sdks/python/`), Java SDK (`/sdks/analytics/java/`), and Go SDK (`/sdks/analytics/go/`)

**Specialized SDKs**: Ampli type-safe wrappers (`/sdks/ampli/`) and dedicated Experiment SDKs (`/sdks/experiment-sdks/`) for feature flag evaluation

The platform maintains extensive integration catalogs with Source Catalog for data ingestion from third-party platforms and Destination Catalog for event streaming to marketing automation, advertising, and attribution tools.

## API Infrastructure and Developer Tools

**Core APIs** include:
- Analytics API (`/apis/analytics/`) for event ingestion and data retrieval
- Experiment APIs (`/apis/experiment/`) for feature flag management and evaluation
- Guides and Surveys API (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) for in-product messaging

**Key API Endpoints**:
- HTTP V2 API for real-time event ingestion
- Batch Event Upload API for server-side data collection
- Evaluation API for feature flag resolution
- Taxonomy API for schema management
- User Privacy API for GDPR/CCPA compliance

**Developer Tools**:
- Ampli CLI with commands like `ampli pull` for code generation and `ampli status --is-merged` for workflow management
- Chrome Extension for real-time debugging
- Visual Labeling for no-code event creation
- Branch-based workflow system for collaborative tracking plan development

## Data Management and Governance

The platform implements sophisticated data governance through:

**Schema Management**: Tracking plans define events, properties, and validation rules with real-time schema violation monitoring and automated remediation workflows

**Data Transformations**: Retroactive data modification capabilities including event/property merging, renaming, and derived property creation using mathematical and logical operators

**Data Quality Controls**: Three-tier violation handling (unexpected events, properties, values) with configurable "mark as unexpected" or "reject" policies

**Privacy and Compliance**: Data Access Control (DAC) for PII classification, configurable Time-to-Live (TTL) policies, and comprehensive user privacy management

## Advanced Analytics Capabilities

**Behavioral Analysis**: Event Segmentation for trend analysis, Funnel Analysis for conversion optimization, Retention Analysis for user engagement measurement, and Lifecycle charts for user journey mapping

**Revenue Analytics**: Revenue LTV charts for customer lifetime value analysis and Impact Analysis for measuring feature impact on business metrics

**User Understanding**: Personas for behavioral segmentation, User Sessions for engagement analysis, and Compass for metric correlation discovery

**Experimentation**: Statistical analysis through Experiment Theory, Advanced Techniques for complex experimental designs, and automated result interpretation

## Enterprise Features and Administration

**Account Management** (`/admin/account-management/`) includes user provisioning, role-based access control, and organization hierarchy management

**Single Sign-On** (`/admin/single-sign-on/`) supports SAML and OAuth integration for enterprise authentication

**Billing and Use** (`/admin/billing-use/`) provides usage monitoring, quota management, and cost optimization tools

**Data Infrastructure**: Warehouse-native Amplitude (`/data/warehouse-native/`) enables analysis directly on customer data warehouses, while CDP capabilities (`/data/`) support comprehensive customer data platform functionality

## Operational Limits and Configuration

The platform enforces specific operational boundaries including 100MB/1M row limits for Lookup Tables, 500K events per device ID daily limits, 5-project portfolio limits, and rate limiting with 429 HTTP responses. Data processing maintains chronological order with idempotency patterns and supports both real-time (minute-by-minute) and scheduled (hourly/daily) synchronization workflows.

Configuration parameters include `config.autocapture.elementInteractions` for Visual Labeling, `fetchRemoteConfig` for Browser SDK management, `$skip_user_properties_sync` for backfill control, and `convertToAmplitudeFunc` for data transformation during cloud storage imports.

The platform serves organizations requiring enterprise-scale analytics with comprehensive data governance, advanced experimentation capabilities, and flexible integration options across web, mobile, and server-side environments.
