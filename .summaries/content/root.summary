## Amplitude Analytics and Experimentation Platform

Amplitude operates a comprehensive customer analytics and experimentation platform designed for product teams to understand user behavior, optimize experiences, and drive growth through data-driven decision making. The platform combines behavioral analytics, feature experimentation, customer data management, session replay, and user engagement tools into an integrated ecosystem.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The platform centers around **Amplitude Analytics** as the core behavioral analytics engine, with specialized modules extending functionality across the customer journey:

**Analytics Core** provides foundational event tracking and user behavior analysis through multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, Cohort Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Revenue LTV, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Personas, Data Tables, and Compass. Legacy chart types are maintained for backward compatibility.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with dedicated workflows for experiment management, advanced statistical techniques, experiment theory, troubleshooting, and technical implementation details. This enables teams to test product changes and measure their impact on user behavior.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages the complete data lifecycle through source catalogs for data ingestion, destination catalogs for data distribution, audience management, and warehouse-native integrations. PII handling integrations ensure compliance with data privacy requirements while maintaining analytical capabilities.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user session recordings, providing qualitative behavioral insights that complement quantitative analytics data.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user engagement through guided experiences and feedback collection, creating closed-loop optimization workflows.

**Web Experiment** provides browser-based experimentation capabilities as a specialized subset of the broader experiment platform, optimized for web-specific use cases.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Collections Structure**: Documentation is organized into product-specific collections with defined routing patterns (`/analytics/{slug}`, `/feature-experiment/{slug}`, `/data/{slug}`) enabling modular content organization.

**Mount Points**: UUID-based content mounting system (e.g., `mount: ba956cb4-9ae1-456a-b122-984b491048f6`) facilitating content reuse and cross-referencing across product areas.

**Navigation Injection**: Systematic categorization through `nav_title` properties including `analytics`, `experiment`, `data`, `apis`, `developers`, `admin`, `get_started`, and specialized chart categories for consistent user navigation.

**Blade System**: Product branding mechanism with specific identifiers like "Amplitude Experiment", "Amplitude Session Replay", and "Amplitude Guides and Surveys" ensuring consistent product presentation across documentation.

**Site Propagation**: Multi-language support architecture with English (`en`) and Japanese (`jp`) variants, controlled through `sites` and `propagate` configuration parameters.

**Statamic CMS Integration**: YAML-based collection configuration with template inheritance, disabled revisions indicating external version control, and taxonomies for integration categorization.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude positions itself as the central nervous system for product analytics and optimization:

**Developer Ecosystem**: Comprehensive SDK support across platforms including Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine. The **Ampli** code generation tool provides type-safe analytics implementation, ensuring data quality and consistency across development teams.

**API Infrastructure**: Dedicated REST APIs for Analytics, Experiment, and Guides and Surveys enable programmatic access to platform capabilities, supporting custom integrations and automated workflows.

**Enterprise Administration**: Complete administrative functionality covering account management, billing and usage tracking, single sign-on integration, and granular user access controls for enterprise-scale deployments.

**Partner Integration Ecosystem**: Extensive third-party integration capabilities through source and destination catalogs, enabling bidirectional data flow between Amplitude and external marketing automation, business intelligence, data warehousing, and customer engagement platforms.

**Migration and Implementation Support**: Dedicated migration documentation and implementation guidance facilitate platform adoption and upgrades from competing analytics solutions.
