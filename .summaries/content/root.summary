# Amplitude Product Documentation

## Product Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform designed to help businesses understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth. The platform provides tools for data collection, analysis, visualization, experimentation, and user engagement, enabling data-driven decision making across organizations.

Key features include behavioral analytics, user segmentation, funnel analysis, retention tracking, A/B testing, feature flagging, and customer journey mapping. Amplitude helps product teams answer critical questions about how users interact with their products, identify opportunities for improvement, and measure the impact of product changes.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

Amplitude's platform consists of several interconnected products that work together:

1. **Analytics** - The core analytics engine that processes and visualizes user behavior data
2. **Experiment** - A/B testing and feature flagging platform for controlled experimentation
3. **Data Management** - Tools for collecting, organizing, and activating user data
4. **Guides and Surveys** - In-product messaging and feedback collection
5. **Session Replay** - User session recording and analysis

The platform follows a data flow architecture where:
- Events are captured through SDKs or APIs (data collection)
- Raw data is processed, enriched, and stored (data processing)
- Data is analyzed through various visualization tools (analysis)
- Insights drive actions through experiments or integrations (activation)

Integration points between products allow for seamless workflows:
- Analytics segments can be targeted in Experiments
- Experiment configurations are delivered to SDKs
- User behavior data informs guide targeting
- Guide interaction data flows back to Analytics

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Analytics Terms
- **Event**: A specific user action or system occurrence tracked in Amplitude
- **User**: An individual interacting with a product, identified by a unique ID
- **Session**: A period of continuous user activity
- **Cohort**: A group of users who share common characteristics
- **Funnel**: A series of steps users take toward a conversion goal
- **Retention**: Measurement of how many users return to a product over time
- **Lifecycle**: Classification of users as new, returning, resurrected, or dormant
- **Stickiness**: Measurement of how frequently users perform specific actions

### Experimentation Terms
- **Experiment**: A controlled test comparing different variations
- **Variant**: A specific version being tested in an experiment
- **Control**: The baseline version in an experiment
- **Feature Flag**: A toggle for enabling/disabling features for specific users
- **Bucketing**: The process of assigning users to experiment variants
- **Statistical Significance**: Confidence level that results aren't due to chance

### Data Management Terms
- **Source**: Origin point of data (website, app, server)
- **Destination**: Platform where data is sent for activation
- **Audience**: A defined segment of users based on behaviors or attributes
- **Identity Resolution**: Process of connecting user identities across platforms
- **Data Warehouse**: Storage system for large volumes of structured data

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates with the broader product and data ecosystem through:

1. **Data Sources**: Connections to various platforms where user data originates, including:
   - Web and mobile applications
   - Server-side systems
   - Third-party tools and platforms

2. **Data Destinations**: Ability to send data and insights to other tools:
   - Marketing automation platforms
   - Customer engagement tools
   - Data warehouses
   - Business intelligence systems

3. **PII Integrations**: Special handling for personally identifiable information with appropriate security and compliance measures

4. **CDP Capabilities**: Customer Data Platform functionality that unifies user profiles across touchpoints

5. **Cross-Platform Identity Resolution**: Connecting user identities across different devices and platforms

## Technical Implementation

### SDK Implementation
