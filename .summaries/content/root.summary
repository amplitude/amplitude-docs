Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides product teams with advanced tools for understanding user behavior, optimizing product experiences, and driving growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products that form a complete analytics ecosystem for modern product development.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform is built around **Amplitude Analytics** as the foundational data collection and analysis engine, complemented by **Amplitude Experiment** for feature flagging and A/B testing, **Amplitude CDP** (Customer Data Platform) for data management and activation, **Amplitude Session Replay** for user experience analysis, and **Amplitude Guides and Surveys** for in-product user engagement.

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the central hub with sophisticated charting capabilities including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, Revenue LTV, and Experiment Results charts. Each chart type provides specialized analytical perspectives with advanced filtering, segmentation, and cohort analysis capabilities.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides enterprise-grade feature management through flag-based deployments, statistical experimentation frameworks, and advanced targeting mechanisms. The platform supports complex experiment designs including multi-armed bandits, sequential testing, and holdout groups with sophisticated statistical analysis including CUPED variance reduction and multiple comparison corrections.

**Amplitude CDP** enables comprehensive data orchestration through Sources (data ingestion), Destinations (data activation), Audiences (behavioral segmentation), and warehouse-native capabilities. The platform supports real-time data streaming, batch processing, and bidirectional data synchronization across the entire marketing and product technology stack.

## Multi-Platform SDK Ecosystem

The platform provides comprehensive SDK coverage across all major development platforms with consistent APIs and feature parity. **Analytics SDKs** include Browser SDK (JavaScript/TypeScript), iOS SDK (Swift/Objective-C), Android SDK (Java/Kotlin), React Native SDK, Flutter SDK, Unity SDK, Unreal SDK, Node.js SDK, Python SDK, Java SDK, and Go SDK.

Each SDK implements core functionality including event tracking with automatic property enrichment, user identification and session management, offline event queuing with retry logic, and configurable batching strategies. Advanced features include middleware systems for event transformation, plugin architectures for extensibility, and comprehensive debugging capabilities.

**Experiment SDKs** provide feature flag evaluation and experiment assignment across matching platforms, with local evaluation capabilities, automatic assignment logging, and cohort-based targeting. The SDKs support both client-side and server-side evaluation patterns with consistent APIs for flag retrieval, user context management, and experiment exposure tracking.

**Ampli** serves as a type-safe wrapper system that generates strongly-typed tracking libraries from centrally defined tracking plans, ensuring data quality and consistency across development teams. Ampli supports code generation for multiple languages with compile-time validation, autocomplete support, and automatic documentation generation.

## Advanced Analytics and Visualization

The charting system provides sophisticated analytical capabilities through specialized visualization types. **Event Segmentation** enables multi-dimensional analysis with advanced filtering, property breakdowns, and statistical functions. **Funnel Analysis** supports conversion optimization with step-by-step dropoff analysis, time-to-convert metrics, and cohort-based funnel comparisons.

**Retention Analysis** provides comprehensive user lifecycle analysis through N-day, unbounded, and bracket retention calculations with cohort trending and predictive modeling. **User Sessions** delivers session-based analytics with duration analysis, page flow tracking, and engagement scoring.

**Journeys** offers advanced user path analysis with sankey flow visualizations, conversion path optimization, and behavioral pattern identification. **Lifecycle** provides user state transition analysis tracking new, current, dormant, and resurrected user segments over time.

**Personas** enables behavioral clustering through machine learning algorithms that automatically identify user segments based on behavioral patterns, with dynamic persona evolution tracking and predictive segment assignment.

## Data Management and Integration

The **CDP** component provides comprehensive data orchestration capabilities through a unified data layer. **Source Catalog** includes pre-built integrations for major platforms including Salesforce, HubSpot, Zendesk, Stripe, Shopify, and hundreds of other business applications with real-time and batch synchronization options.

**Destination Catalog** enables data activation across advertising platforms (Google Ads, Facebook Ads, TikTok), marketing automation tools (Braze, Iterable, SendGrid), data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift), and business intelligence platforms with configurable data mapping and transformation rules.

**Audiences** provides sophisticated behavioral segmentation with real-time audience computation, predictive audience modeling, and automated audience synchronization to downstream platforms. The system supports complex audience definitions using behavioral criteria, demographic filters, and predictive scoring models.

## API Architecture and Integration

The platform exposes comprehensive REST APIs across all product areas. **Analytics APIs** provide programmatic access to chart data, user profiles, event data, and cohort definitions with endpoints like `/api/2/events/segmentation`, `/api/2/funnels`, and `/api/2/retention`. Rate limiting, authentication via API keys and service accounts, and comprehensive error handling ensure reliable integration patterns.

**Experiment APIs** enable programmatic experiment management through endpoints for flag configuration (`/api/1/flags`), user assignment (`/api/1/vardata`), and results analysis (`/api/1/experiments/{id}/results`). The APIs support both individual user lookups and batch operations for high-throughput applications.

**CDP APIs** provide data ingestion endpoints (`/api/2/httpapi`), audience management (`/api/2/audiences`), and destination configuration with support for real-time streaming and batch uploads. Webhook systems enable real-time notifications for audience membership changes and experiment assignments.

## Enterprise Administration and Security

**Account Management** provides comprehensive organizational controls including user provisioning, role-based access control, and team management. The platform supports hierarchical permission structures with granular access controls for different product areas and data sensitivity levels.

**Single Sign-On** integration supports SAML 2.0, OIDC, and major identity providers including Okta, Azure AD, and Google Workspace with automated user provisioning and group-based role assignment.

**Billing and Usage** management provides detailed consumption tracking across all product areas with configurable usage alerts, overage protection, and detailed cost allocation reporting for multi-team organizations.

## Advanced Features and Capabilities

**Session Replay** provides pixel-perfect user session recordings with privacy controls, performance optimization, and integration with analytics events for contextual analysis. The system supports selective recording based on user segments, error conditions, or specific user journeys.

**Guides and Surveys** enables sophisticated in-product user engagement through contextual onboarding flows, targeted feedback collection, and behavioral messaging with advanced targeting, personalization, and A/B testing capabilities.

**Migration** tools and services support data transition from other analytics platforms including Google Analytics, Mixpanel, and Adobe Analytics with automated data mapping, historical data import, and validation frameworks.

The platform includes comprehensive **FAQ and Troubleshooting** resources, **Academy Content** for user education, and **Partner** integrations that extend functionality across the broader product development ecosystem.
