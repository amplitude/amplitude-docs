Amplitude is a comprehensive behavioral analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, conduct feature experiments, and activate insights across their product ecosystem. The platform operates through four interconnected product areas that provide end-to-end analytics and experimentation capabilities.

## Core Product Architecture

**Amplitude Analytics** forms the foundational behavioral analytics engine, offering 13 distinct chart types for data visualization: Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Impact Analysis, Revenue LTV, Engagement Matrix, and Experiment Results. These visualization tools enable deep behavioral analysis through cohort analysis, user journey mapping, and conversion optimization workflows.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced statistical analysis, supporting both client-side and server-side experimentation workflows. The experimentation suite includes comprehensive experiment theory documentation, advanced statistical techniques, troubleshooting guides, and detailed result analysis tools.

**Amplitude CDP (Customer Data Platform)** manages the complete data lifecycle through Sources and Destinations architecture, enabling organizations to collect behavioral data from multiple touchpoints and distribute insights to downstream systems. The CDP includes audience management capabilities, warehouse-native functionality, and PII handling compliance features.

**Specialized Products** encompass Session Replay for user experience analysis, Guides and Surveys for in-product messaging campaigns, and an extensive Partner ecosystem facilitating third-party integrations.

## SDK and API Ecosystem

The platform provides comprehensive instrumentation through multiple SDK families:

**Analytics SDKs** support all major development platforms including Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine, maintaining consistent APIs for event tracking and user identification across environments.

**Experiment SDKs** enable feature flag evaluation and experiment participation management across both client and server environments.

**Ampli** serves as a code-generation tool that creates type-safe analytics implementations based on tracking plans, ensuring data quality and instrumentation consistency.

**API Suite** includes the Analytics API for behavioral data querying, Experiment APIs for feature flag management, and Guides and Surveys API for campaign orchestration.

## Key Nomenclature and Data Model

**Events** represent discrete user actions tracked within the platform and form the foundational data unit for all behavioral analysis.

**Properties** are metadata attributes associated with either events (event properties) or users (user properties), enabling sophisticated segmentation and filtering capabilities.

**Cohorts** define user segments based on behavioral criteria or imported from external systems for targeted analysis.

**Charts** are analytical visualization tools that process event data through different frameworks (segmentation, funnels, retention analysis, etc.).

**Experiments** are controlled statistical tests measuring the impact of product changes on user behavior metrics.

**Feature Flags** are configuration toggles controlling feature availability and experiment participation logic.

**Sources** represent data collection endpoints that transmit events to the Amplitude platform.

**Destinations** are external systems receiving processed data or cohort information from Amplitude.

**Tracking Plans** define schema validation rules and governance policies for event instrumentation.

## Enterprise and Administrative Framework

The platform includes comprehensive administrative capabilities through **Account Management** for user provisioning and organizational permissions, **Single Sign-On** for enterprise authentication integration, **Billing and Usage** monitoring for subscription management, and **Data Governance** encompassing retention policies, privacy controls, and regulatory compliance features.

## Integration and Migration Architecture

Amplitude supports extensive platform migration through documented transition pathways from competing analytics platforms, comprehensive troubleshooting resources, and FAQ documentation. The **Partner Integration Platform** enables bidirectional data exchange through cohort syncing, event streaming, and event ingestion patterns with third-party systems.

## API Endpoints and Command Structure

The platform exposes RESTful APIs through structured endpoints:
- Analytics API for querying behavioral data and chart results
- Experiment API for feature flag configuration and experiment management  
- Cohort API for audience segment management
- Guides and Surveys API for campaign orchestration

SDK implementations provide consistent method signatures across platforms for core functions like `track()`, `identify()`, and `setUserProperties()`.

## Documentation Architecture and Routing

The documentation follows a hierarchical URL structure:
- `/analytics/` - Core behavioral analytics features and chart types
- `/feature-experiment/` - Experimentation platform capabilities
- `/data/` - CDP functionality and data management
- `/sdks/` - Platform-specific instrumentation documentation
- `/apis/` - API reference materials
- `/admin/` - Administrative and governance functions
- `/get-started/` - Onboarding and initial setup content

## Ecosystem Integration and Accessibility

The platform operates on a freemium subscription model with advanced features requiring Plus or higher tiers. Multi-language support includes Japanese localization, and accessibility features encompass feedback mechanisms and navigation optimization. The broader product ecosystem integrates with warehouse-native architectures, enabling organizations to maintain data sovereignty while leveraging Amplitude's analytical capabilities.
