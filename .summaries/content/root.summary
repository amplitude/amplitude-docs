Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of several interconnected products that work together to deliver end-to-end user analytics, experimentation, and engagement capabilities.

## Core Product Architecture and Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem is built around four primary product areas that integrate to provide a complete user analytics solution:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational data collection and analysis engine, providing behavioral analytics through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Cohort Analysis, and Revenue LTV tracking. The analytics platform supports real-time data processing and offers specialized visualization tools like Compass for metric monitoring, Personas for user segmentation, and Journeys for path analysis.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities, enabling teams to run controlled experiments and gradually roll out features. The platform includes advanced statistical analysis, multi-armed bandit optimization, and sophisticated targeting mechanisms that integrate with analytics data for precise user segmentation.

**Amplitude Session Replay** provides visual user experience analysis by recording and replaying user sessions, allowing teams to understand user behavior patterns, identify friction points, and validate hypotheses derived from quantitative analytics data.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** functions as the engagement layer, enabling teams to act on analytical insights through in-product messaging, user onboarding flows, feedback collection, and contextual help systems.

## Data Infrastructure and Customer Data Platform (CDP)

Amplitude's CDP capabilities center around comprehensive data management through Sources and Destinations architecture. The platform supports data ingestion from multiple sources including web applications, mobile apps, server-side implementations, and third-party integrations. Data transformation and routing capabilities enable organizations to create unified customer profiles and distribute data across their technology stack.

**Audiences** functionality allows for dynamic user segmentation based on behavioral patterns, demographic data, and custom properties, with real-time updates as user behavior changes. These audiences integrate across all Amplitude products and can be synced to external platforms through the destination catalog.

**Warehouse-native Amplitude** provides direct integration with cloud data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift), enabling organizations to perform analytics directly on their existing data infrastructure without data movement.

## SDK and Integration Ecosystem

Amplitude provides comprehensive instrumentation through platform-specific SDKs and APIs:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser SDK (`@amplitude/analytics-browser`), Android SDK, iOS SDK, React Native SDK, Flutter SDK, Unity SDK, Unreal SDK, Node.js SDK, Python SDK, Java SDK, and Go SDK. Each SDK provides methods like `amplitude.init()`, `amplitude.track()`, `amplitude.identify()`, and `amplitude.setUserId()` for event tracking and user identification.

**Ampli** serves as a type-safe wrapper that generates strongly-typed tracking libraries based on predefined tracking plans, ensuring data quality and consistency across implementations.

**Experiment SDKs** provide feature flag evaluation and experiment assignment through platform-specific implementations with methods like `experiment.fetch()`, `experiment.variant()`, and `experiment.exposure()`.

**APIs** include Analytics API for server-side data ingestion, Experiment APIs for programmatic experiment management, and Guides and Surveys API for content management and analytics.

## Advanced Analytics and Chart Types

The platform offers specialized analytical tools for different use cases:

**Event Segmentation** enables analysis of user actions across different dimensions and time periods, supporting complex filtering and grouping operations.

**Funnel Analysis** tracks user progression through defined conversion paths, identifying drop-off points and optimization opportunities.

**Retention Analysis** measures user return behavior over time, supporting cohort-based analysis and churn prediction.

**Revenue LTV** provides customer lifetime value analysis with revenue attribution and forecasting capabilities.

**Impact Analysis** measures the statistical significance of changes in key metrics, supporting causal inference and experiment analysis.

**Engagement Matrix** visualizes user engagement patterns across frequency and recency dimensions.

**Stickiness** measures product engagement by analyzing daily, weekly, and monthly active user relationships.

## Experimentation and Feature Management

Amplitude Experiment provides comprehensive A/B testing and feature flag management:

**Experiment Theory** encompasses statistical methodologies including power analysis, sample size calculation, and significance testing with support for multiple comparison corrections.

**Advanced Techniques** include multi-armed bandit optimization, sequential testing, and Bayesian analysis methods.

**Workflow** management supports experiment lifecycle from hypothesis formation through results analysis, with integrated approval processes and rollout controls.

**Under the Hood** technical implementation includes assignment mechanisms, exposure tracking, and statistical computation engines.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** provides organization-level controls including user provisioning, role-based access control, and team management.

**Single Sign-On** supports SAML and OIDC integration with enterprise identity providers.

**Billing and Use** tracking provides usage monitoring, quota management, and cost optimization tools.

**PII Integrations** ensure compliance with privacy regulations through data classification and handling controls.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** represent user actions or system occurrences that are tracked and analyzed within the platform.

**Properties** are key-value pairs that provide additional context about events or users.

**Cohorts** are dynamic user segments based on shared characteristics or behaviors.

**Funnels** represent sequential user journeys through defined conversion paths.

**Retention** measures the percentage of users who return to perform actions over time.

**Amplitude ID** serves as the primary user identifier for cross-platform user tracking.

**Session** represents a period of user activity, typically bounded by inactivity periods.

**Conversion** indicates successful completion of desired user actions or goals.

## Integration Patterns and API Endpoints

Key API endpoints include:
- `/api/2/httpapi` for Analytics API event ingestion
- `/sdk/vardata` for Experiment flag evaluation
- `/api/identify` for user property updates
- `/api/batch` for bulk event processing

Common command-line patterns involve SDK initialization, event tracking, and user identification across different platforms and programming languages.

## Broader Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates with the broader marketing and product technology stack through:

**Source Catalog** supporting data ingestion from analytics platforms, marketing tools, customer support systems, and business applications.

**Destination Catalog** enabling data activation through advertising platforms, email marketing tools, customer data platforms, and business intelligence systems.

**Partners** ecosystem including technology integrations, consulting services, and implementation specialists.

The platform serves as a central hub for customer data and insights, enabling organizations to create closed-loop optimization processes where analytical insights drive experimentation, which informs product decisions, which generate new data for analysis. This creates a continuous improvement cycle that helps organizations build better products and user experiences through data-driven decision making.
