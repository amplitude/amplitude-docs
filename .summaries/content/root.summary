- **Ampli**: Code generation layer for type-safe tracking

### Administration
Platform management tools:
- Account Management
- Billing and Usage monitoring
- Single Sign-On configuration

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: A discrete user action or system occurrence tracked in Amplitude
- **User**: An individual interacting with a product, identified by a unique ID
- **Property**: Metadata associated with events or users
- **Session**: A period of continuous user engagement with a product
- **Funnel**: A sequence of events representing a conversion path
- **Retention**: Measurement of users returning to a product over time
- **Cohort**: A group of users who share common characteristics or behaviors
- **Experiment**: A controlled test comparing variants of a feature
- **Feature Flag**: Configuration toggle for enabling/disabling features
- **Variant**: A specific version of a feature being tested
- **Source**: Data input connection for bringing data into Amplitude
- **Destination**: Data output connection for exporting data from Amplitude
- **Audience**: Defined segment of users based on behaviors or properties
- **Ampli**: Code generation layer that provides type-safe tracking
- **CDP**: Customer Data Platform for unified user data management

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's products are designed to work together in an integrated workflow:

1. **Data Collection → Analysis → Action**:
   - Data is collected via SDKs or Sources
   - Analytics tools process and visualize the data
   - Insights drive actions through Experiment or external integrations

2. **Experiment and Analytics Integration**:
   - Experiments are designed based on Analytics insights
   - Experiment results are analyzed using Analytics charts
   - Impact Analysis measures the effects of implemented changes

3. **Data Flow Architecture**:
   - Sources → Amplitude Platform → Destinations
   - SDKs → Analytics → Experiment → Charts/Visualization

4. **Cross-Platform Implementation**:
   - Consistent SDKs across platforms ensure uniform data collection
   - Server and client-side options provide flexibility in implementation

5. **Administrative Layer**:
   - Account management, billing, and SSO provide organizational control
   - Data governance features ensure proper handling of sensitive information

## Technical Implementation

### API Endpoints and SDK Methods

The platform provides extensive SDK implementations with consistent patterns:

- SDK initialization:
  ```javascript
  // Browser SDK example
  amplitude.init(API_KEY, {
    // Configuration options
  });
  ```

- Event tracking:
  ```javascript
  amplitude.track('Event Name', {
    // Event properties
  });
  ```

- User identification:
  ```javascript
  amplitude.setUserId('user_id');
  amplitude.setUserProperties({
    // User properties
  });
  ```

- Experiment variant retrieval:
  ```javascript
  const variant = experiment.variant('experiment-key', userContext);
  ```

- Feature flag evaluation:
  ```javascript
  const isEnabled = amplitude.flagEnabled('flag-key', userContext);
  ```

The documentation follows a structured URL pattern that reflects the organization of the product itself:
- `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/{slug}`
- `/sdks/{platform}/{slug}`
- `/apis/{product}/{slug}`
- `/data/{feature}/{slug}`
- `/feature-experiment/{section}/{slug}`
- `/admin/{feature}/{slug}`

This architecture demonstrates how Amplitude has built an integrated ecosystem where data flows seamlessly between collection, analysis, and action components, enabling a complete product analytics and optimization workflow.
