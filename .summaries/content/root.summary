Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Core Product Architecture

### Analytics Platform
Amplitude Analytics serves as the foundational product, providing event-based user behavior tracking and analysis. The platform captures user interactions as events with associated properties, supporting both individual user analytics and account-level reporting through the Accounts add-on for B2B use cases. The system processes data through multiple APIs including HTTP V2, Batch, Identify, and Group Identify APIs.

### Experimentation Suite
Amplitude Experiment provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced techniques for statistical analysis. The platform includes experiment theory documentation, troubleshooting guides, and comprehensive workflow management. Experiment Results charts integrate directly with the analytics platform for unified analysis.

### Session Intelligence
Session Replay captures qualitative user session recordings synchronized with quantitative event streams, providing contextual understanding of user behavior patterns and friction points.

### User Engagement Tools
Guides and Surveys enables in-product messaging and feedback collection, with dedicated APIs for programmatic management of user engagement campaigns.

## Chart Types and Analytical Capabilities

The platform offers specialized chart types for different analytical needs:

- **Event Segmentation**: Measures event frequency and user engagement patterns
- **Funnel Analysis**: Tracks conversion rates and identifies drop-off points
- **Retention Analysis**: Analyzes user return behavior and long-term engagement
- **User Sessions**: Provides session-based metrics and behavior analysis
- **Stickiness**: Measures engagement frequency and habit formation
- **Journeys**: Explores user paths and navigation patterns
- **Lifecycle**: Tracks user progression through product stages
- **Compass**: Provides directional insights for product optimization
