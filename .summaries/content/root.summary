Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides product teams with tools for user behavior analysis, feature experimentation, data management, and in-product user engagement. The platform consists of several interconnected products designed to help organizations understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven decision making.

## Core Product Architecture

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, offering a comprehensive suite of chart types for behavioral analysis including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Revenue LTV, and Experiment Results. Each chart type provides specialized visualization and analysis capabilities for different aspects of user behavior, from conversion tracking to cohort analysis and revenue attribution.

**Amplitude Experiment** is the feature flagging and experimentation platform that enables A/B testing, feature rollouts, and advanced experimentation techniques. It includes experiment theory documentation, workflow management, advanced techniques, troubleshooting resources, and "under the hood" technical implementation details. The platform supports both client-side and server-side experimentation with comprehensive SDK coverage.

**Amplitude CDP (Customer Data Platform)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and distribution through Sources, Destinations, Audiences, and warehouse-native capabilities. It includes extensive catalogs of pre-built integrations for both data sources and destinations, enabling seamless data flow across the entire marketing and analytics technology stack.

**Amplitude Session Replay** provides visual user session recordings and analysis capabilities, allowing teams to observe actual user interactions and identify friction points in the user experience.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** delivers in-product user engagement through contextual guides, feedback collection surveys, and resource centers that help with onboarding, feature adoption, and user feedback collection.

## SDK and API Ecosystem

The platform provides comprehensive SDK coverage across multiple programming languages and platforms:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine implementations, each with platform-specific optimizations and features. These SDKs handle event tracking, user identification, and behavioral data collection.

**Experiment SDKs** provide feature flag evaluation and experiment assignment capabilities across the same platform coverage, ensuring consistent experimentation capabilities regardless of technology stack.

**Ampli** serves as a type-safe wrapper and code generation tool that creates strongly-typed analytics implementations based on tracking plans, reducing implementation errors and improving developer experience.

**APIs** include Analytics API for server-side event ingestion, Experiment APIs for programmatic experiment management, and Guides and Surveys API for in-product experience management.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** are the fundamental unit of behavioral data, representing user actions or system occurrences with associated properties and timestamps.

**User Properties** are attributes that describe users and persist across sessions, while **Event Properties** are attributes specific to individual events.

**Cohorts** and **Audiences** represent user segments based on behavioral criteria or properties, used for analysis and targeting.

**Experiments** encompass feature flags, A/B tests, and multivariate tests with concepts like variants, allocation, and statistical significance.

**Charts** are analytical visualizations with specific methodologies for measuring different aspects of user behavior and product performance.

**Sources** are data input mechanisms (SDKs, APIs, third-party integrations) while **Destinations** are data output targets (warehouses, marketing tools, analytics platforms).

**Instrumentation** refers to the implementation of tracking code and data collection mechanisms across applications and systems.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

The platform includes comprehensive administrative capabilities through **Account Management**, **Billing and Use** monitoring, **Single Sign-on** integration, and role-based access controls. These features support enterprise deployment with proper governance, security, and cost management.

**Migration** tools and documentation help organizations transition from other analytics platforms, while **FAQ and Troubleshooting** resources provide comprehensive support for implementation and operational issues.

## Integration and Partner Ecosystem

Amplitude maintains extensive **Partner** integrations and a comprehensive **Destination Catalog** and **Source Catalog** that includes hundreds of pre-built connectors for popular tools and platforms. This ecosystem approach enables organizations to integrate Amplitude into existing technology stacks without significant custom development.

**PII Integrations** provide specialized handling for personally identifiable information, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations while maintaining analytical capabilities.

## Multi-language and Accessibility

The platform supports internationalization through **Japanese Translation** content and multi-site architecture (`en`, `jp` sites), indicating global deployment capabilities and localized user experiences.

## Developer Experience and Documentation

The documentation architecture includes **Get Started** guides, detailed **Instrumentation** instructions, **Academy Content** for education, and comprehensive API documentation. The platform emphasizes developer experience through tools like Ampli for type-safe implementations and extensive SDK documentation.

**Agents** functionality suggests automated or programmatic capabilities for data processing or analysis, while **Legacy Charts** documentation ensures backward compatibility for existing implementations.

The platform's routing structure reveals a hierarchical organization with clear separation between product areas (`/analytics/`, `/feature-experiment/`, `/data/`, `/sdks/`, `/apis/`) and specialized functionality, enabling users to navigate efficiently between different aspects of the platform based on their role and use case.
