**Ampli** (`/sdks/ampli/`) provides type-safe analytics implementation through code generation, compile-time validation, and IDE integration for reduced implementation errors.

## API Infrastructure

**Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/`) - RESTful endpoints for event ingestion, user property management, and behavioral data queries with batch processing support

**Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) - Feature flag configuration, experiment setup, variant assignment, and statistical results retrieval

**Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) - In-product messaging orchestration, survey deployment, and response collection

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Analytics Concepts:**
- **Events** - Discrete user actions or system occurrences with timestamp and property metadata
- **Properties** - Key-value attributes associated with events (event properties) or users (user properties)
- **Cohorts** - Dynamic user groups defined by behavioral criteria or demographic attributes
- **Segments** - Filtered subsets of users or events for targeted analysis and comparison
- **Sessions** - Temporally grouped user interactions with configurable timeout thresholds
- **Funnels** - Sequential event chains representing conversion processes with step-by-step analysis

**Experimentation Terminology:**
- **Flags** - Boolean or multi-variant feature toggles controlling functionality exposure
- **Variants** - Different implementations of features tested against control groups
- **Allocation** - Percentage-based user assignment to experimental conditions
- **Statistical Power** - Probability of detecting true effects in experimental results
- **Confidence Intervals** - Range estimates for experimental effect sizes

**Data Management Concepts:**
- **Device ID** - Persistent anonymous identifier for cross-session user tracking
- **User ID** - Customer-defined identifier for authenticated user experiences
- **Sample Rate** - Percentage of events or users included in data collection
- **Data Residency** - Geographic data storage location (US/EU server zones)
- **PII (Personally Identifiable Information)** - Sensitive data requiring special handling protocols

**Privacy and Compliance:**
- **Masking** - Automatic obfuscation of sensitive data elements in Session Replay
- **Consent Management** - User permission tracking for GDPR/CCPA compliance
- **Data Retention** - Configurable storage duration policies for different data types

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** (`/admin/account-management/`) - Organization hierarchy, user role assignment, project permissions, and access control policies

**Single Sign-On** (`/admin/single-sign-on/`) - Enterprise authentication integration with SAML, OAuth, and directory services

**Billing and Usage** (`/admin/billing-use/`) - Event volume monitoring, feature usage tracking, and subscription tier management
