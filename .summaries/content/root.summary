Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive data-driven decision making across web and mobile applications through integrated analytics, experimentation, session replay, and user engagement tools.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform operates through four interconnected product areas that form a unified analytics ecosystem:

**Amplitude Analytics** functions as the foundational behavioral analytics engine, providing multiple specialized chart types including Event Segmentation for trend analysis, Funnel Analysis for conversion tracking, Retention Analysis for user engagement measurement, User Sessions for interaction analysis, Cohort Analysis for user segmentation, and advanced visualizations like Compass, Journeys, and Revenue LTV. The analytics engine supports real-time data processing with configurable behavioral sampling through the Scale feature for high-volume enterprise deployments.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with statistical analysis, supporting both client-side and server-side experimentation workflows. The system includes experiment result analysis, impact analysis, and sophisticated targeting through behavioral cohorts and user properties, enabling data-driven product development.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and reconstructs user interactions across web and mobile platforms, providing visual insights through session recordings and heatmaps while maintaining strict privacy controls and GDPR compliance through configurable masking levels.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user engagement through targeted messaging, onboarding flows, and feedback collection with behavioral targeting and A/B testing capabilities.

## Data Infrastructure and Integration Framework

The platform operates on a Customer Data Platform (CDP) architecture supporting both first-party data collection and third-party integrations. The **Source Catalog** includes pre-built connectors for popular tools and platforms, while the **Destination Catalog** enables data activation across marketing, product, and analytics tools. The system supports **Warehouse-native Amplitude** deployments for organizations maintaining data in existing data warehouses.

The platform supports international deployments with Japanese translation capabilities and multi-site content management, indicating global enterprise readiness with comprehensive localization support.

## SDK and API Ecosystem

Amplitude provides comprehensive instrumentation through multiple SDK categories:

**Analytics SDKs** include platform-specific implementations: Browser SDK, iOS SDK, Android SDK, React Native SDK, Flutter SDK, Node.js SDK, Python SDK, Java SDK, Go SDK, Unity SDK, and Unreal SDK. Each SDK supports both behavioral event tracking and Session Replay capabilities through plugin architectures.

**Experiment SDKs** provide dedicated feature flag evaluation and experiment participation across all supported platforms.

**Ampli** serves as a code-generation tool creating type-safe analytics implementations, ensuring data quality and consistency across development teams.

**API Infrastructure** exposes multiple endpoints including:
- Analytics API for data ingestion and export
- Experiment APIs for flag management and evaluation  
- Guides and Surveys API for in-product messaging
- User Management API for account administration
- User Privacy API for GDPR compliance

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Organizations and Projects** form a hierarchical structure where Organizations contain multiple Projects, each representing distinct applications or data sources. The Portfolio feature enables cross-project analysis through unified Views.

**Events and Properties** constitute the core data model consisting of user actions (events) with associated metadata (properties). The platform supports custom events, derived properties, and behavioral cohorts for advanced segmentation.

**User Identity Management** provides sophisticated identity resolution supporting user ID and device ID tracking, with cross-platform user mapping and privacy-compliant data deletion capabilities.

**Behavioral Cohorts** are dynamic user segments based on behavioral patterns used for targeting in experiments, surveys, and destination integrations.

**Chart Types and Analysis Methods** include specialized analytics visualizations: Event Segmentation (trend analysis), Funnel Analysis (conversion tracking), Retention Analysis (user engagement), Stickiness (usage frequency), Lifecycle (user state transitions), and Personas (behavioral clustering).

## Enterprise Administration and Governance

**Account Management** provides comprehensive organizational controls including role-based permissions (Viewer, Member, Manager, Admin), Permission Groups for bulk access management, and SCIM 2.0 integration for identity provider synchronization.

**Single Sign-On** supports enterprise authentication integration through SAML and other SSO protocols.

**Data Governance** includes self-service data deletion, PII handling controls, and comprehensive audit logging for compliance requirements.

**Billing and Usage Management** offers transparent usage tracking and billing controls for cost management across large deployments.

## Advanced Analytics and Statistical Capabilities

**Statistical Analysis** employs advanced statistical methods for experiment analysis including confidence intervals, statistical significance testing, and impact analysis for measuring experiment effects.

**Behavioral Analysis** provides sophisticated user behavior analysis through engagement matrices, user journey mapping, and lifecycle analysis.

**Revenue Analytics** delivers comprehensive revenue tracking and analysis through Revenue LTV charts with multi-currency support and customer lifetime value calculations.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The platform integrates into the broader analytics and product development ecosystem through extensive **Migration** documentation and tools for transitioning from other analytics platforms. The **Partner Ecosystem** includes extensive partner integrations and pre-built connectors for popular tools across marketing, product, and data infrastructure categories.

**Academy Content** provides comprehensive educational resources and best practices for analytics implementation and optimization, supporting user adoption and platform optimization.

The architecture demonstrates enterprise-grade capabilities with comprehensive privacy controls, global deployment support, and sophisticated analytics capabilities that scale from startup to enterprise implementations while maintaining data quality and compliance requirements across the entire product development lifecycle.
