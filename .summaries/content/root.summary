# Amplitude Product Suite

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics platform that helps businesses understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth. The platform consists of several interconnected products and features:

1. **Analytics** - Core analytics capabilities for tracking user behavior and visualizing data through various chart types
2. **Experiment** - Feature experimentation and A/B testing platform
3. **CDP (Customer Data Platform)** - Data management and integration capabilities
4. **SDKs** - Client and server libraries for different platforms to instrument applications
5. **APIs** - Programmatic interfaces for data ingestion, export, and management

Key use cases include product analytics, user behavior tracking, funnel analysis, cohort creation, experimentation, and data integration with other systems.

## Product Relationships and Structure

The Amplitude ecosystem is organized into several main product areas:

1. **Analytics Platform**:
   - Charts (Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, Event Segmentation, User Sessions, etc.)
   - Data Tables
   - Journeys
   - Compass
   - Session Replay

2. **Data Management**:
   - Sources (data ingestion)
   - Audiences (user segmentation)
   - Destination Catalog (data export)
   - PII Integrations
   - CDP (Customer Data Platform)

3. **Experimentation**:
   - Web Experiment
   - Experiment SDKs
   - Experiment APIs
   - Experiment Results
   - Workflow
   - Under the Hood (technical details)

4. **SDKs and Instrumentation**:
   - Analytics SDKs (Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal)
   - Server SDKs (Node.js, Python, Java, Go)
   - Ampli (SDK wrapper)
   - Instrumentation guides

5. **Administration**:
   - Account Management
   - Billing and Usage
   - Single Sign-On

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: A user action or occurrence tracked in Amplitude (identified by event_type)
- **User Properties**: Attributes associated with users (demographics, preferences, etc.)
- **Event Properties**: Attributes associated with specific events
- **Cohort**: A segment of users defined by behavioral criteria
- **Funnel**: A sequence of events representing a user journey
- **Retention**: Analysis of how users return to a product over time
- **Session**: A group of user activities within a time period
- **Taxonomy**: The schema definition for events and properties
- **device_id**: Unique identifier for a device or browser
- **user_id**: Custom identifier for a user, typically from authentication system
- **amplitude_id**: Amplitude's internal user identifier
- **group_type/group_value**: Identifiers for account-level analytics

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude platform components work together in an integrated ecosystem:

1. **Data Collection**: SDKs (Browser, iOS, Android, etc.) capture user events and send them to Amplitude's servers.

2. **Data Processing**: The ingested data is processed, enriched, and stored for analysis.

3. **Analytics**: The processed data powers various chart types and analysis tools to understand user behavior.

4. **Experimentation**: The Experiment platform uses the collected data to measure the impact of A/B tests and feature releases.

5. **Data Activation**: Audiences created from analytics can be exported to marketing and engagement tools via the Destination Catalog.

6. **Administration**: Account management, billing, and SSO features manage access and usage of the platform.

The platform supports a workflow where data is collected via SDKs, analyzed through charts and reports, segmented into audiences, and then activated through experiments or exported to other systems.

### SDK Implementation Examples
The documentation includes code examples for implementing various SDKs:

```javascript
// Browser SDK example
amplitude.getInstance().logEvent('Button Clicked', {
  buttonColor: 'blue',
  buttonText: 'Sign Up'
});
```

```swift
// iOS SDK example
Amplitude.instance().logEvent("Button Clicked", withEventProperties: [
  "buttonColor": "blue",
  "buttonText": "Sign Up"
])
```

The platform also provides the Ampli SDK wrapper which offers type-safe tracking with code generation based on a tracking plan.
