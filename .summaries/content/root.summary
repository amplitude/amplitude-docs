Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools for understanding user behavior, optimizing product experiences, and driving growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of several interconnected products that work together to deliver end-to-end analytics, experimentation, and user engagement capabilities.

## Core Product Architecture

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, providing event tracking, user behavior analysis, and comprehensive reporting through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Cohort Analysis (Lifecycle), Stickiness, Revenue LTV, Journeys, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Impact Analysis, and Engagement Matrix. The platform supports both current and legacy chart implementations for backward compatibility.

**Amplitude Experiment** is the feature flagging and A/B testing platform that enables controlled rollouts, multivariate testing, and advanced experimentation techniques. It includes experiment theory documentation, workflow management, troubleshooting guides, and "under the hood" technical implementation details for statistical analysis and result interpretation.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and reconstructs user sessions to provide visual insights into user interactions, enabling teams to understand user behavior beyond traditional analytics metrics.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** delivers in-product user engagement through contextual messaging, onboarding flows, feedback collection, and help documentation via an integrated Resource Center with AI-powered content recommendations.

## Data Management and Customer Data Platform (CDP)

The platform includes a robust **Customer Data Platform (CDP)** that manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation across the entire customer journey. Key components include:

**Sources and Destinations**: Comprehensive catalog of integrations for data ingestion from various platforms and activation to downstream tools, with dedicated source-catalog and destination-catalog collections supporting taxonomies for integration categorization.

**Audiences**: Advanced user segmentation capabilities that enable precise targeting based on behavioral patterns, user properties, and engagement metrics.

**Data Governance**: Including PII (Personally Identifiable Information) integrations for privacy compliance, data quality management, and warehouse-native Amplitude capabilities for organizations using cloud data warehouses.

## Multi-Platform SDK Ecosystem

Amplitude provides extensive SDK support across platforms and languages:

**Analytics SDKs**: Browser (JavaScript), Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine SDKs, each with platform-specific optimizations and features.

**Experiment SDKs**: Dedicated SDKs for feature flagging and experimentation across web and mobile platforms, with server-side and client-side evaluation capabilities.

**Ampli**: A code-generation tool that creates type-safe analytics implementations, ensuring data quality and consistency across development teams.

## API Infrastructure

The platform exposes comprehensive APIs for programmatic access:

**Analytics API**: Enables data ingestion, event tracking, and analytics data retrieval with endpoints for real-time and batch processing.

**Experiment APIs**: Provide programmatic control over feature flags, experiment configuration, and result analysis.

**Guides and Surveys API**: Allows integration of in-product messaging and feedback collection into custom workflows.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management**: User provisioning, role-based access control, and organizational structure management with granular permissions across different product areas.

**Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Enterprise authentication integration supporting SAML, OIDC, and other identity providers.

**Billing and Usage**: Comprehensive usage tracking, billing management, and quota monitoring across all Amplitude products.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events**: User actions tracked within applications, forming the foundation of all analytics and experimentation.

**Properties**: Attributes associated with events or users that enable segmentation and analysis.

**Cohorts/Audiences**: Groups of users defined by shared characteristics or behaviors.

**Experiments**: Controlled tests comparing different product variations to measure impact on key metrics.

**Feature Flags**: Configuration switches that control feature availability and behavior without code deployments.

**Segments**: Filtered subsets of users or events used in analytics charts and targeting.

**Funnels**: Sequential user journeys through defined steps, typically used for conversion analysis.

**Retention**: Measurement of user return behavior over specified time periods.

**Amplitude IDs**: Unique identifiers for users across sessions and devices, enabling cross-platform user journey tracking.

## Integration Ecosystem

The platform supports extensive integrations through:

**Partners**: Third-party integrations and marketplace solutions that extend Amplitude's capabilities.

**Agents**: Automated data processing and transformation tools that enhance data quality and insights.

**Warehouse-native**: Direct integration with cloud data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift) for organizations preferring to keep data in their own infrastructure.

## Documentation and Support Structure

The documentation is organized into several key areas:

**Get Started**: Onboarding guides, basic concepts, and initial setup procedures.

**Migration**: Resources for transitioning from other analytics platforms or upgrading between Amplitude versions.

**FAQ and Troubleshooting**: Common issues, solutions, and best practices across all products.

**Academy Content**: Educational resources and training materials for maximizing platform value.

**Instrumentation**: Technical implementation guides for proper event tracking and data collection.

The platform supports multi-language documentation with dedicated Japanese translations, indicating global enterprise adoption and localization capabilities.

## Routing and URL Structure

The documentation reveals a hierarchical URL structure that reflects the product organization:
- `/analytics/` for core analytics features
- `/feature-experiment/` for experimentation capabilities  
- `/data/` for CDP and data management features
- `/sdks/` for development resources
