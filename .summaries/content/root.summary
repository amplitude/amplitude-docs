**Compass** provides automated insights and anomaly detection, surfacing statistically significant changes in user behavior and key performance metrics.

**Revenue LTV** tracks customer lifetime value and revenue attribution, connecting behavioral patterns directly to business outcomes and monetization metrics.

**Impact Analysis** measures statistical significance of metric changes, supporting data-driven decision making with confidence intervals and significance testing.

**Lifecycle** analyzes user progression through defined stages from acquisition through activation to long-term retention and advocacy.

**Engagement Matrix** and **Stickiness** provide complementary views of user engagement patterns, usage frequency, and product adoption depth.

## Data Infrastructure and Integration

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** capabilities enable comprehensive data unification through the Source Catalog, featuring over 70 integrations across data warehouses, marketing platforms, mobile attribution providers, and customer engagement tools.

**Destination Catalog** provides data activation functionality, enabling behavioral cohorts and analytical insights to be exported to marketing automation platforms, advertising networks, and downstream business tools.

**Warehouse-native Amplitude** allows organizations to run Amplitude analytics directly on existing data warehouse infrastructure (Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks) without requiring data movement or duplication.

**Audiences** functionality creates and manages dynamic user segments based on real-time behavioral patterns, supporting both static cohort creation and continuously updating segment definitions.

## SDK and Implementation Ecosystem

**Analytics SDKs** provide comprehensive instrumentation across all major platforms including Browser (JavaScript), iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine, with consistent event tracking APIs for both client-side and server-side implementations.

**Experiment SDKs** enable feature flag evaluation and experiment participation tracking across the same platform ecosystem, supporting both local evaluation for performance optimization and remote evaluation for dynamic configuration.

**Ampli** serves as a type-safe wrapper that generates strongly-typed tracking libraries from Amplitude's Data taxonomy, ensuring implementation consistency and reducing instrumentation errors across development teams.

## Experimentation Platform Architecture

**Amplitude Experiment** provides sophisticated feature flagging and experimentation capabilities through several key components:

**Advanced Techniques** include complex targeting rules, gradual percentage rollouts, mutual exclusion groups for experiment isolation, and multi-armed bandit optimization for dynamic traffic allocation.

**Statistical Engine** encompasses sequential testing methodologies, minimum detectable effect calculations, statistical power analysis, and confidence interval computation for robust experiment analysis.

**Flag Evaluation System** supports boolean toggles, string variants, numeric variants, and JSON configuration objects with high-performance local and remote evaluation modes.

**Workflow Management** covers the complete experiment lifecycle from hypothesis formation through statistical analysis to feature rollout and post-experiment monitoring.

## API Infrastructure

**Analytics API** provides programmatic access through RESTful endpoints for:
- Event ingestion with batch and real-time streaming capabilities
- User identification and property management
- Behavioral data export and cohort definitions
- Chart data retrieval and dashboard automation

**Experiment APIs** enable server-side integration through endpoints for:
- Feature flag evaluation and variant assignment
- Experiment configuration management
- Statistical results analysis and reporting
- User assignment and exclusion management

**Guides and Surveys API** supports programmatic campaign management for in-product messaging creation, targeting rule configuration, and user feedback collection automation.

## Enterprise Administration

**Account Management** provides organization-level controls including hierarchical user permissions, multi-project management, cross-project analytics, and resource allocation across teams and business units.

**Single Sign-On (SSO)** supports enterprise authentication through SAML and OAuth providers with granular role-based access controls and audit logging capabilities.

**Billing and Usage** tracking provides comprehensive visibility into event volume consumption, feature utilization, and cost allocation across projects and organizational units.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Events** represent discrete, timestamped user actions tracked through SDKs, forming the atomic data unit for all analytics computations and experimentation analysis.

**User Properties** store persistent attributes about individual users (demographics, subscription status, user type), while **Event Properties** capture contextual information specific to individual actions (page URL, button clicked, purchase amount).

**Cohorts** are dynamically defined user segments based on behavioral patterns, demographic attributes, or custom criteria, supporting complex inclusion/exclusion logic and real-time membership updates.

**Feature Flags** control feature visibility and application behavior through configurable toggles supporting boolean states, string variants, numeric parameters, and complex JSON configuration objects.

**Variants** represent different experimental treatments in A/B tests, with statistical analysis engines comparing performance metrics across variant groups using advanced statistical methodologies.

**Attribution Windows** define temporal boundaries for connecting user acquisition events to downstream behavioral patterns, conversions, and lifetime value calculations.

**Conversion Events** mark successful completion of desired user actions, enabling funnel analysis and goal-based optimization across the customer journey.

## Technical Implementation Patterns

The platform follows consistent URL routing patterns:
- `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/{feature-slug}` for analytics documentation
- `/sdks/{platform}/{implementation-guide}` for SDK integration guides  
- `/apis/{product-area}/{endpoint-reference}` for API documentation
- `/feature-experiment/{category}/{feature-slug}` for experimentation features

Navigation architecture uses standardized collection identifiers (`analytics`, `experiment_sdks`, `apis`, `data`) to maintain consistent information hierarchy and cross-referencing capabilities.

Content organization employs mount points to connect related documentation collections, enabling hierarchical structure and seamless navigation between interconnected features and capabilities.

## Broader Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates into the broader marketing and product technology stack through extensive partnership ecosystem including data warehouse providers (Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks), marketing automation platforms (Braze, Iterable, Salesforce), advertising networks (Facebook, Google, TikTok), and customer engagement tools (Zendesk, Intercom, Slack).

The platform supports modern data architecture patterns including reverse ETL for data activation, real-time streaming for immediate insights, and composable CDP approaches that respect existing data infrastructure investments while providing advanced analytics and experimentation capabilities.

This comprehensive approach enables organizations to implement data-driven product development and growth optimization strategies across the complete customer lifecycle, from initial acquisition through long-term retention and expansion.
