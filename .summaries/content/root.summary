Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides behavioral analytics, customer data management, and product optimization tools for businesses to understand and improve user experiences across web and mobile applications.

## Core Product Architecture

The Amplitude ecosystem consists of five integrated products that work together seamlessly:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational behavioral analytics platform, offering AI-powered automation for product growth insights. It includes Session Replay functionality for visual user behavior analysis and supports multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, Journeys, User Sessions, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Revenue LTV, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Impact Analysis, and Engagement Matrix.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging, A/B testing, multivariate experiments, and Multi-armed Bandit capabilities. It includes advanced techniques, experiment theory, and comprehensive troubleshooting resources. The platform integrates with Web Experiment for client-side, no-code experimentation through visual editors and custom code injection.

**Amplitude Data** manages the Customer Data Platform (CDP) with cross-device identity resolution, data quality improvement tools, audience management, and warehouse-native capabilities. It includes comprehensive source and destination catalogs with integration taxonomies, plus PII handling capabilities.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** replaces traditional popup components for user onboarding, feedback collection, and engagement optimization throughout the user journey.

**Amplitude Session Replay** provides visual recordings of user sessions with filtering capabilities by cohorts, events, properties, and session duration, including support for HTML masking and advanced web technologies.

## Product Relationships and Integration

The platform operates through a unified data architecture where Analytics serves as the central hub, with Experiment results feeding back into Analytics charts for statistical analysis. Session Replay integrates directly with Analytics through User Look-Up and various chart types. The CDP ensures data quality and synchronization across all products while managing audience segmentation that can be used for experiment targeting.

Web Experimentation operates as a standalone JavaScript SDK that integrates with the broader Amplitude ecosystem through impression event tracking, user property setting, and behavioral cohort targeting. The system transforms experiment data into Analytics events for comprehensive analysis.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Behavioral Analytics**: Analysis of user actions and interactions within digital products to understand behavior patterns and drive optimization decisions.

**Session Replay**: Visual recordings of user sessions with advanced filtering and masking capabilities, supporting Canvas WebGL, iFrames, and Lottie Animations.

**Feature Flagging**: Remote configuration system enabling controlled feature rollouts and experiments without code deployments.

**Multi-armed Bandit**: Advanced experimentation methodology that automatically optimizes traffic allocation to best-performing variants during experiments.

**Cross-device Identity Resolution**: Technology connecting user behavior across multiple devices and touchpoints to create unified user profiles.

**Ampli CLI and Wrapper**: Code-generation tools providing type-safe tracking plan implementation with static type checking and autocomplete functionality.

**Flag Key**: Unique identifier for experiments used in tracking events and variant assignment.

**Bucketing**: Algorithm assigning users to experiment variants based on Device ID and rollout percentage.

**Anti-flicker Overlay**: Mechanism preventing visual artifacts during experiment evaluation and loading.

## Broader Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates extensively through comprehensive APIs and SDK support across multiple programming languages and platforms. The platform provides:

- **Analytics/Data APIs** (`/apis/analytics/`) for programmatic access to behavioral data
- **Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) for managing feature flags and experiments
- **Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) for in-product messaging management

Authentication mechanisms include SCIM tokens, org API keys, and secret keys. The platform supports both client-side and server-side SDK implementations with dedicated SDKs for Android, iOS, Browser, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal, Node.js, Python, Java, and Go.

Third-party integrations include Segment, Tealium iQ, WordPress plugins, Shopify apps, and Google Tag Manager through custom HTML tags. The destination and source catalogs provide extensive integration capabilities with external systems.

## Technical Implementation

### SDK Routes and Endpoints
- Analytics SDKs: `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/`
- Experiment SDKs: `/sdks/experiment-sdks/`
- Ampli implementation: `/sdks/ampli/`

### Web Experiment Implementation
```javascript
// Synchronous script loading
<script src="https://cdn.amplitude.com/script/API_KEY/web-experiment.js"></script>

// Utility functions
waitForElement() // Asynchronous DOM element waiting
utils.remove() // SPA cleanup functionality
```

### Administrative Features
The platform includes comprehensive administrative capabilities accessible through `/admin/` routes:
- Account Management (`/admin/account-management/`)
- Billing and Use (`/admin/billing-use/`)
- Single Sign-on (`/admin/single-sign-on/`)

### Content Organization
Documentation is organized by navigation contexts including `analytics`, `experiment`, `data`, `apis`, `analytics_sdks`, `experiment_sdks`, with specialized sections for charts, partners, and troubleshooting. The platform supports multi-site deployment with English and Japanese localization, including dedicated Japanese translation collections.

The system emphasizes migration of winning experiment variants to production code rather than permanent 100% traffic allocation, following a workflow of statistical analysis, production implementation, experiment deactivation, and cleanup to minimize technical debt and optimize performance.
