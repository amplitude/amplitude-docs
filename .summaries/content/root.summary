Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides product teams with tools to understand user behavior, optimize experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products that work together to provide end-to-end analytics, experimentation, and user engagement capabilities.

## Core Product Architecture

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational data collection and analysis platform, offering multiple chart types for behavioral analysis including Event Segmentation (user action analysis), Funnel Analysis (conversion tracking), Retention Analysis (user return patterns), User Sessions (engagement measurement), Journeys (path analysis), Lifecycle (user state transitions), Stickiness (usage frequency), Personas (behavioral clustering), Compass (metric monitoring), Impact Analysis (feature impact measurement), Engagement Matrix (user activity visualization), Revenue LTV (lifetime value analysis), Data Tables (raw data exploration), and Experiment Results (A/B test analysis).

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced techniques including statistical analysis, experiment theory foundations, workflow management, troubleshooting tools, and under-the-hood technical implementation details. The platform supports sophisticated targeting, rollout controls, and statistical significance calculations.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and reconstructs user sessions for qualitative analysis, enabling teams to understand user behavior through visual playback of interactions, clicks, and navigation patterns.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** delivers in-product user engagement through contextual messaging, onboarding flows, feedback collection, and user guidance systems directly within applications.

## Data Infrastructure and Integration

The platform operates on a Customer Data Platform (CDP) architecture that includes comprehensive data management through Sources (data ingestion from various platforms), Destinations (data activation to downstream tools), Audiences (user segmentation and targeting), and Warehouse-native capabilities for direct data warehouse integration.

**Source Catalog** provides pre-built integrations for data collection from web, mobile, server-side, and third-party platforms, while the **Destination Catalog** enables data activation across marketing, analytics, and operational tools. Both catalogs are organized by integration categories and support extensive customization.

**Data Tables** functionality allows direct querying and analysis of raw event data, while **Warehouse-native Amplitude** enables analysis directly within existing data warehouse infrastructure without data movement.

## SDK and API Ecosystem

The platform provides comprehensive instrumentation through multiple SDKs:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser SDK (web applications), Android SDK (native Android), iOS SDK (native iOS), React Native SDK (cross-platform mobile), Flutter SDK (cross-platform), Node.js SDK (server-side JavaScript), Python SDK (server-side Python), Java SDK (server-side Java), Go SDK (server-side Go), Unity SDK (game development), and Unreal SDK (game development).

**Experiment SDKs** provide feature flagging and experimentation capabilities across all supported platforms with consistent APIs for flag evaluation, user targeting, and experiment assignment.

**Ampli** serves as a type-safe wrapper that generates strongly-typed tracking libraries based on your tracking plan, ensuring data quality and consistency across implementations.

**Framework Integrations** provide specialized support for popular development frameworks, simplifying implementation and providing framework-specific optimizations.

## API Infrastructure

The platform exposes comprehensive APIs for programmatic access:

**Analytics API** enables event ingestion, user property management, and data export with endpoints for batch and real-time data processing.

**Experiment APIs** provide programmatic control over feature flags, experiment configuration, and user assignment with REST endpoints for flag evaluation and management.

**Guides and Surveys API** allows programmatic control over in-product messaging, survey deployment, and response collection.

All APIs support authentication through API keys and follow RESTful conventions with comprehensive rate limiting and error handling.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** provides organization-level controls for user access, billing, and resource allocation across multiple projects and teams.

**Single Sign-on (SSO)** integration supports enterprise authentication systems including SAML and OAuth providers for centralized user management.

**Billing and Use** monitoring provides detailed usage tracking, cost management, and plan optimization tools for enterprise deployments.

**PII Integrations** ensure compliance with privacy regulations through data governance tools, user data deletion capabilities, and privacy-compliant data handling.

## Advanced Analytics Capabilities

**Agents** provide AI-powered insights and automated analysis recommendations based on user behavior patterns and statistical anomalies.

**Legacy Charts** maintain backward compatibility with previous chart implementations while providing migration paths to newer analysis tools.

**Other Charts** encompass specialized analysis tools for specific use cases and advanced statistical analysis requirements.

## Developer Resources and Support

**Get Started** documentation provides onboarding flows for new users, implementation guides, and best practice recommendations.

**Migration** resources assist teams transitioning from other analytics platforms with data migration tools, implementation guides, and compatibility information.

**FAQ and Troubleshooting** provides comprehensive support documentation, common issue resolution, and implementation guidance.

**Academy Content** offers educational resources, certification programs, and advanced training materials for platform mastery.

**Partners** ecosystem includes certified implementation partners, technology integrations, and professional services providers.

## Multi-language and Localization

The platform supports internationalization through **Japanese Translation** content and localized documentation, with plans for additional language support across the interface and documentation.

## Content Management System

The underlying content management system uses a collection-based architecture with features including:
- Multi-site support (English and Japanese)
- Content propagation controls
- Revision management
- URL routing with slug-based patterns
- Preview capabilities with live refresh
- Taxonomy support for content categorization
- Structured navigation injection
- Date-based content visibility controls

Route patterns follow consistent conventions like `/analytics/{slug}`, `/sdks/{platform}/{slug}`, `/apis/{product}/{slug}`, and `/feature-experiment/{category}/{slug}`, providing intuitive navigation and content organization.

The platform represents a comprehensive analytics ecosystem designed to support product teams throughout the entire user lifecycle, from initial data collection through advanced experimentation and user engagement optimization.
