- **Retention Analysis**: Retention Analysis, Stickiness, Lifecycle, Compass
- **Engagement Analysis**: Engagement Matrix, Personas, Impact Analysis
- **Revenue Analysis**: Revenue LTV, Experiment Results

The platform includes collaboration features like Spaces, Dashboards, Notebooks, and Templates, along with AI-powered capabilities such as Ask Amplitude, anomaly detection, and root cause analysis.

### Data Management
Amplitude Data provides tools for collecting, managing, and governing analytics data:

- **Data Collection**: SDKs for various platforms (Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity, etc.)
- **Data Planning**: Tracking plans, schema validation, and type-safe implementation through Ampli
- **Data Quality**: Observability tools, validation against tracking plans, and debugging capabilities
- **Data Transformation**: Custom events, derived properties, and lookup tables
- **Integration Capabilities**: Source and destination catalogs for connecting with other platforms

### Experimentation
Amplitude Experiment enables teams to test hypotheses and optimize product experiences:

- **A/B Testing**: Statistical experimentation with variant comparison
- **Feature Flags**: Controlled feature rollouts and targeting
- **Evaluation Modes**: Both remote (server-side) and local (client-side) evaluation
- **Statistical Analysis**: Sequential testing, confidence intervals, and CUPED variance reduction
- **Web Experiment**: No-code experimentation for websites

### User Engagement
Amplitude provides tools for engaging users and collecting feedback:

- **Session Replay**: Video-like recordings of user sessions with privacy controls
- **Guides and Surveys**: In-product messaging and feedback collection

### Customer Data Platform
Amplitude's CDP capabilities enable personalization and data activation:

- **Audience Management**: Behavioral cohorts and predictive segments
- **Data Activation**: Cohort syncing to marketing platforms
- **Personalization**: AI-powered recommendations and predictions

## Key Relationships Between Products

The Amplitude ecosystem is designed with clear relationships between products:

1. **Data Collection → Analysis → Action**: Data flows from collection through SDKs to analysis in charts and finally to action through experimentation or engagement tools.

2. **Shared User Identity**: All products use the same user identification system, enabling consistent tracking across the platform.

3. **Integrated Experimentation**: Experiment results are analyzed using the same analytics tools that track regular product metrics.

4. **Activation Capabilities**: Insights from analytics can be activated through cohort syncing to marketing platforms.

5. **Cross-Platform Consistency**: SDKs for different platforms maintain consistent tracking capabilities while respecting platform-specific implementation patterns.

## Key Nomenclature

- **Events**: User actions tracked in the system (clicks, page views, purchases)
- **Event Properties**: Contextual data about specific events
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes associated with users
- **Cohorts**: Groups of users who share common behaviors or attributes
- **Sessions**: Periods of continuous user activity
- **Amplitude ID**: Internal identifier that links device IDs and user IDs
- **Tracking Plan**: Schema defining expected events and properties
- **Feature Flag**: Toggle that controls feature availability
- **Experiment**: Controlled test comparing different variants
- **Monthly Tracked Users (MTU)**: Primary billing metric counting unique users per month

## Technical Implementation

Amplitude provides multiple implementation options:

1. **Client-Side SDKs**: Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity
2. **Server-Side SDKs**: Node.js, Python, Go, Java, Ruby
3. **Ampli Wrapper**: Type-safe implementation based on tracking plans
4. **HTTP APIs**: Direct event sending through REST endpoints

The platform supports both EU and US data residency options, with appropriate server endpoints for each region. Authentication uses API keys for client-side implementations and Secret keys for server-side security.

Amplitude's integrated ecosystem enables organizations to collect high-quality data, derive meaningful insights, test hypotheses, and create personalized user experiences—all within a unified platform that supports cross-functional collaboration between product, marketing, and engineering teams.
