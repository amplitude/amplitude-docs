Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of several interconnected products that work together to deliver end-to-end analytics, experimentation, and user engagement capabilities.

## Core Product Architecture

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, providing event tracking, user behavior analysis, and comprehensive reporting through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Cohort Analysis, and Revenue LTV. The analytics platform supports real-time data processing and offers advanced features like Compass (automated insights), Personas (behavioral segmentation), and Journeys (user path analysis).

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced statistical methods, enabling teams to run controlled experiments and gradually roll out features. The platform includes experiment theory documentation, advanced techniques, and comprehensive result analysis tools.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user sessions to provide visual insights into user behavior, complementing quantitative analytics with qualitative understanding.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user engagement through contextual guidance, onboarding flows, and feedback collection directly within applications.

## SDK and Integration Ecosystem

The platform provides comprehensive SDK support across multiple programming languages and platforms:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser SDK (JavaScript), iOS SDK (Swift/Objective-C), Android SDK (Java/Kotlin), React Native SDK, Flutter SDK, Node.js SDK, Python SDK, Java SDK, Go SDK, Unity SDK, and Unreal SDK. Each SDK follows consistent patterns for event tracking, user identification, and configuration management.

**Experiment SDKs** provide feature flag evaluation and experiment assignment capabilities across the same platform ecosystem, with consistent APIs for flag evaluation and experiment exposure tracking.

**Ampli** serves as a code-generation tool that creates type-safe analytics implementations based on tracking plans, ensuring data quality and consistency across development teams.

## Data Management and Customer Data Platform (CDP)

**Data Sources and Destinations** enable comprehensive data integration through a catalog of pre-built connectors for popular tools and platforms. The Source Catalog includes integrations for data ingestion, while the Destination Catalog provides data export capabilities to downstream systems.

**Audiences** allows creation of behavioral segments that can be synced to marketing and engagement platforms for targeted campaigns and personalized experiences.

**Data Tables** provide direct access to underlying event data for custom analysis and reporting needs.

**Warehouse-native Amplitude** enables organizations to run Amplitude analytics directly on their existing data warehouse infrastructure.

## API Infrastructure

The platform exposes comprehensive APIs for programmatic access:

**Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/`) provides endpoints for data export, user lookup, and custom integrations with routes following RESTful patterns.

**Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) enable programmatic experiment management, flag configuration, and result retrieval.

**Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) supports content management and deployment automation.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** (`/admin/account-management/`) provides organization-level controls for user permissions, project settings, and access management.

**Single Sign-On** (`/admin/single-sign-on/`) enables enterprise authentication integration with SAML and OAuth providers.

**Billing and Use** (`/admin/billing-use/`) offers usage monitoring and billing management capabilities.

**PII Integrations** (`/data/pii/`) provide privacy-compliant data handling for personally identifiable information.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Events**: User actions tracked within applications (clicks, page views, purchases)
- **Properties**: Attributes associated with events or users that enable segmentation and analysis
- **Cohorts**: Groups of users defined by shared characteristics or behaviors
- **Funnels**: Sequential steps in user journeys with conversion analysis
- **Retention**: Measurement of user return behavior over time periods
- **Segments**: Filtered views of data based on specific criteria
- **Feature Flags**: Boolean toggles that control feature availability
- **Variants**: Different versions of features or experiences in experiments
- **Exposure**: When a user is assigned to an experiment variant
- **Statistical Significance**: Confidence level that experiment results are not due to chance
- **Lift**: Percentage improvement of a variant over the control
- **Mount Points**: UUID identifiers that link collections to specific content hierarchies

## URL Routing and Navigation Structure

The platform uses hierarchical URL routing that reflects the product organization:

- `/analytics/` - Core analytics features and charts
- `/analytics/charts/` - Specific chart types (funnel-analysis, retention-analysis, etc.)
- `/feature-experiment/` - Experiment management and configuration
- `/sdks/` - SDK documentation and implementation guides
- `/apis/` - API reference and integration documentation
- `/data/` - Data management and CDP features
- `/admin/` - Administrative and enterprise controls
- `/get-started/` - Onboarding and initial setup guidance

## Content Management System

The documentation architecture uses a collection-based content management system with specific configurations:

**Site Propagation** controls content availability across different locales (English 'en', Japanese 'jp')

**Template and Layout** systems provide consistent presentation across different content types

**Preview Targets** enable content review before publication with automatic refresh capabilities

**Navigation Injection** organizes content within specific navigation contexts (analytics, experiment, data, etc.)

**Date Behavior** controls content visibility based on publication dates (past: public, future: private)

## Ecosystem Integration and Workflow

Amplitude integrates into broader product development workflows through its comprehensive API ecosystem, webhook support, and extensive third-party integrations. The platform supports both real-time and batch data processing, enabling organizations to build custom analytics solutions while leveraging Amplitude's core infrastructure.

The experimentation workflow integrates with feature development cycles, providing statistical rigor for product decisions while maintaining development velocity through automated experiment analysis and reporting.

Data flows bidirectionally, with Amplitude both consuming data from various sources and distributing insights and segments to activation platforms, creating a complete loop from data collection through insight generation to action execution.
