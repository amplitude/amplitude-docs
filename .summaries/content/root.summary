## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Analytics Terms**:
   - **Event** - A discrete user action or system occurrence tracked in Amplitude
   - **Event Segmentation** - Analysis of events filtered by properties and user segments
   - **Funnel Analysis** - Tracking user progression through sequential events
   - **Retention Analysis** - Measuring how users return to a product over time
   - **Cohort** - A group of users who share common characteristics or behaviors
   - **Journeys** - Visualization of user paths through a product
   - **Stickiness** - Measurement of how frequently users perform specific actions
   - **Impact Analysis** - Evaluating the effect of product changes on key metrics

2. **Experimentation Terms**:
   - **Experiment** - A controlled test comparing different variations
   - **Feature Flag** - Toggle for enabling/disabling features for specific users
   - **Variant** - A specific version in an experiment
   - **Bucketing** - Process of assigning users to experiment groups
   - **Statistical Significance** - Confidence level in experiment results

3. **Data Management Terms**:
   - **Source** - Origin point of data flowing into Amplitude
   - **Destination** - Platform receiving data from Amplitude
   - **Audience** - Defined segment of users based on behavior or attributes
   - **Taxonomy** - Standardized naming conventions for events and properties
   - **Data Governance** - Policies and procedures for managing data quality and privacy

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's products form an integrated workflow:

1. **Data Collection and Processing**:
   - SDKs collect user behavior data from applications
   - Server-side tracking captures backend events
   - Integrations with third-party sources supplement first-party data
   - Data is processed, validated, and stored according to the defined taxonomy

2. **Analysis and Insight Generation**:
   - Analytics tools process the collected data into meaningful visualizations
   - Specialized charts provide different analytical perspectives
   - Dashboards combine insights for stakeholders across the organization
   - Automated reporting distributes insights to relevant teams

3. **Experimentation and Optimization**:
   - Insights from Analytics inform experiment hypotheses
   - Experiment platform enables testing of variations
   - Feature flags control rollout of new functionality
   - Results feed back into Analytics for deeper understanding

4. **Data Activation**:
   - Audiences created in Analytics can be exported to marketing and product tools
   - Experiment results trigger automated actions
   - Integrations enable closed-loop marketing and product optimization

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

Amplitude provides several API endpoints:

1. **Analytics API**:
   - `GET /api/2/events` - Retrieve event data
   - `GET /api/2/users` - Access user profiles
   - `GET /api/2/funnels` - Retrieve funnel analysis data
   - `POST /api/2/httpapi` - Send events to Amplitude

2. **Experiment API**:
   - `GET /api/2/experiments` - List experiments
   - `POST /api/2/experiments` - Create experiments
   - `GET /api/2/experiments/{id}/results` - Retrieve experiment results
   - `POST /api/2/flags` - Create feature flags

3. **SDK Implementation Examples**:
   - Browser SDK: `amplitude.getInstance().logEvent("event_name", eventProperties)`
   - iOS SDK: `Amplitude.instance().logEvent("event_name", withEventProperties: eventProperties)`
   - Server-side (Node.js): `amplitude.track({event_type: "event_name", user_id: "user123", event_properties: eventProperties})`
   - Ampli SDK: `ampli.eventName(eventProperties).track()`

The platform includes extensive integration capabilities with third-party systems through the Source Catalog and Destination Catalog, enabling bidirectional data flow between Amplitude and other tools in the marketing and product technology stack.
