## Amplitude Analytics Platform

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics platform that provides product analytics, experimentation, customer data management, and user engagement tools. The platform enables organizations to track user behavior, run experiments, analyze customer journeys, and optimize product experiences through data-driven insights.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem consists of several interconnected product suites:

**Core Analytics Platform:**
- **Analytics**: The foundational product providing event tracking, user segmentation, and behavioral analysis through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Revenue LTV, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Data Tables, and Compass
- **Charts**: Specialized visualization tools organized by analytical purpose, with legacy chart support for backward compatibility

**Experimentation Suite:**
- **Amplitude Experiment**: Feature flagging and A/B testing platform with advanced techniques, experiment theory, workflow management, and troubleshooting capabilities
- **Web Experiment**: Browser-based experimentation tools
- **Experiment Results**: Dedicated analytics for measuring experiment performance

**Data Management Platform:**
- **CDP (Customer Data Platform)**: Centralized data management with source and destination catalogs, audience management, and warehouse-native capabilities
- **Sources and Destinations**: Integration ecosystem for data ingestion and activation
- **PII Integrations**: Privacy-compliant data handling solutions

**Additional Products:**
- **Session Replay**: User session recording and analysis
- **Guides and Surveys**: In-product messaging and feedback collection
- **Ampli**: Type-safe analytics implementation framework

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Data and Analytics Terms:**
- **Events**: User actions tracked within applications (clicks, page views, purchases)
- **Properties**: Attributes associated with events (event properties) or users (user properties)
- **Amplitude ID**: Unique user identifier that handles identity resolution and user merging
- **Segments**: Filtered groups of users based on behavior or attributes
- **Cohorts**: Time-based user groupings for retention and lifecycle analysis

**Experimentation Terminology:**
- **Feature Flags**: Boolean toggles controlling feature availability
- **Variants**: Different versions of features being tested
- **Allocation**: Percentage of users exposed to experiments
- **Statistical Significance**: Confidence level in experiment results

**Data Management Concepts:**
- **Sources**: Systems sending data to Amplitude (mobile apps, websites, servers)
- **Destinations**: External platforms receiving data from Amplitude
- **Taxonomies**: Organized classification systems for integrations
- **Warehouse-native**: Direct analysis of data in customer data warehouses

**Platform Structure:**
- **Collections**: Organized content groupings within the documentation system
- **Mount Points**: Content organization identifiers for hierarchical structure
- **Navigation Injection**: Contextual navigation assignment (analytics, experiment, data, etc.)
- **Blade Assignment**: Product-specific branding and context

## Ecosystem Integration and Platform Positioning

Amplitude operates as a unified platform where products integrate seamlessly:

**Cross-Product Data Flow:**
Analytics data feeds directly into Experiment for audience targeting and results measurement. CDP manages data quality and routing between all products. Session Replay provides qualitative context for quantitative analytics insights.

**SDK and API Architecture:**
- **Analytics SDKs**: Platform-specific libraries (Android, iOS, Browser, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, Unreal) for event tracking
- **Experiment SDKs**: Dedicated libraries for feature flag evaluation and experiment participation
- **Ampli**: Code-generation tool creating type-safe wrappers around analytics implementations

**Administrative Integration:**
Centralized account management, billing, single sign-on, and user permissions span all products. Partner integrations extend platform capabilities through the source and destination catalogs.

## API Endpoints and Technical Specifications

**Primary API Categories:**
- **Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/{slug}`): Event ingestion, user properties, and data export
- **Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/{slug}`): Feature flag management, variant assignment, and results tracking
- **Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/{slug}`): In-product messaging and survey management

**SDK Implementation Patterns:**
- Analytics SDKs follow consistent initialization, event tracking, and user identification patterns across platforms
- Experiment SDKs provide feature flag evaluation with local caching and fallback mechanisms
- Ampli generates platform-specific code ensuring type safety and validation

**Data Integration Routes:**
- Source catalog integrations use standardized data ingestion patterns
- Destination catalog follows consistent data activation and export protocols
- Warehouse-native solutions provide direct SQL access to Amplitude data

**Content Organization:**
The platform documentation uses route-based organization with URL patterns like `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/{slug}`, `/sdks/{product}/{platform}/{slug}`, and `/feature-experiment/{category}/{slug}`, enabling intuitive navigation and content discovery across the comprehensive product suite.
