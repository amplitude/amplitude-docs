Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven decision making. The platform integrates analytics, experimentation, customer data management, and user experience tools into a unified ecosystem for product teams, marketers, and data professionals.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem consists of several interconnected product areas that work synergistically:

**Analytics Core** serves as the foundation, providing event tracking, user segmentation, and behavioral analysis through specialized chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Personas, Stickiness, Compass, Data Tables, Impact Analysis, Revenue LTV, and Engagement Matrix. Legacy charts are maintained for backward compatibility.

**Experimentation Suite** encompasses Amplitude Experiment for feature flagging and A/B testing with advanced statistical techniques, experiment workflow management, and results analysis. Web Experimentation extends this with client-side testing through a Visual Editor that requires no code changes.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** handles the complete data lifecycle through Sources for ingestion, Destinations for activation, audience creation and management, warehouse-native functionality, and PII handling with support for both real-time and batch processing.

**Developer Tools** provide comprehensive SDK support across all major platforms (Android, iOS, Browser, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, Unreal) with Ampli for type-safe analytics implementation. APIs are available for Analytics, Experiment, and Guides and Surveys.

**User Experience Tools** include Session Replay for capturing user interactions and qualitative analysis, plus Guides and Surveys for in-product user research and onboarding flows.

**Administrative Infrastructure** encompasses account management, billing and usage tracking, single sign-on integration, and enterprise-grade governance controls.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** are user actions tracked within applications, forming the analytical foundation and serving as the basis for all segmentation and analysis.

**Properties** are attributes associated with events (event properties) or users (user properties) that enable detailed segmentation and behavioral analysis.

**Cohorts/Audiences** are groups of users defined by shared characteristics or behaviors, used for targeting in experiments and data activation.

**Segments** are filtered subsets of users or events used in chart analysis to compare different populations or behaviors.

**Funnels** provide sequential analysis of user progression through defined steps, measuring conversion rates and identifying drop-off points.

**Retention** measures user return behavior over time, analyzing how many users continue engaging with a product.

**Journeys** show path analysis of how users navigate through different events and states within an application.

**Feature Flags** are configuration switches that control feature availability and behavior without requiring code deployments.

**Variants** are different versions of features or experiences tested in experiments, with users bucketed into variants for comparison.

**Destinations** are third-party platforms and tools that receive data from Amplitude for activation and further analysis.

**Sources** are systems and applications that send data into Amplitude for processing and analysis.

**Instrumentation** is the process of implementing tracking code to capture user events and properties.

## Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates extensively with the broader marketing and product technology stack through multiple integration patterns:

**Data Integration** connects with hundreds of sources and destinations through its catalog, including major advertising platforms, CRMs, email marketing tools, and business intelligence platforms. Warehouse-native capabilities enable direct integration with data warehouses like Snowflake, BigQuery, and Redshift.

**Development Workflow** integration supports all major platforms and frameworks through comprehensive SDKs, with Ampli providing code generation for type-safe implementation. The platform integrates with CI/CD pipelines and supports both client-side and server-side tracking patterns.

**Third-party Platform Integration** includes CDPs like Segment and Tealium, tag managers like Google Tag Manager, and CMS platforms like WordPress and Shopify. Custom integrations are supported through APIs and webhooks.

**Enterprise Systems** integration provides single sign-on with major identity providers, administrative APIs for programmatic management, and partner integrations for extended functionality.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Analytics API** provides endpoints for event ingestion (`/2/httpapi`), user lookup, cohort management, and data export with both HTTP and batch processing capabilities.

**Experiment APIs** enable programmatic flag management, user assignment, and results analysis with real-time evaluation capabilities through endpoints like `/sdk/vardata` for variant resolution.

**Guides and Surveys API** supports campaign management, response collection, and targeting configuration.

**Key Implementation Patterns** include:
- Event tracking through `amplitude.track()` methods across all SDKs
- User identification via `amplitude.setUserId()` and device ID management
- Property setting through `amplitude.setUserProperties()` and event property parameters
- Experiment evaluation via `amplitude.variant()` and flag resolution
- Session management and replay capture through browser SDK extensions

**Documentation Structure** follows clear URL patterns:
- `/analytics/` for core analytics features and chart types
- `/feature-experiment/` for experimentation tools and methodologies
- `/sdks/` for development resources and implementation guides
- `/apis/` for API documentation and technical references
- `/data/` for CDP and data management functionality
- `/admin/` for administrative functions and account management

The platform emphasizes both ease of implementation for getting started and advanced capabilities for enterprise use cases, with comprehensive migration guides, troubleshooting resources, and multi-language support including Japanese localization. The architecture supports real-time data processing, advanced statistical analysis, and enterprise-scale data governance while maintaining developer-friendly implementation patterns.
