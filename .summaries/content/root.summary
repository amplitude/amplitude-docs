Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform consisting of four interconnected core products that form a unified behavioral analytics ecosystem.

## Core Product Suite

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the primary behavioral analytics engine, offering 16+ specialized chart types including Event Segmentation for user behavior analysis, Funnel Analysis for conversion tracking, Retention Analysis for engagement measurement, and advanced ML-powered features like Personas for user clustering and Compass for retention threshold identification.

**Amplitude Data** functions as a customer data platform (CDP) providing data governance, tracking plan management, and warehouse-native capabilities. It supports 70+ source integrations and maintains data quality through schema validation and real-time monitoring.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with both remote and local evaluation modes, supporting traditional statistical testing and multi-armed bandit optimization with sophisticated traffic management through mutual exclusion groups and holdout testing.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user sessions across web, mobile, and React Native applications, providing visual context for behavioral data patterns identified in the analytics platform.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

The platform operates on a multi-layered architecture where data flows seamlessly between products through shared infrastructure:

**Data Foundation Layer** consists of comprehensive instrumentation through 11+ platform SDKs (Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity), the Source Catalog with 70+ integrations, and robust data management capabilities including schema validation and data governance tools.

**Analytics Processing Layer** transforms raw behavioral data into actionable insights through specialized chart types that work in concert - users typically start with Event Segmentation to understand behaviors, progress to Funnel Analysis for conversion optimization, and use Retention Analysis for engagement measurement.

**Experimentation Layer** leverages the same user identification system and event tracking infrastructure as Analytics, enabling seamless experiment analysis and statistical validation of feature impacts on behavioral metrics.

**Activation Layer** includes Guides for in-product messaging, Surveys for user feedback collection, and a destination catalog with 100+ integrations for data activation across marketing and product tools.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Identity Management System**:
- `amplitude_id`: Platform-generated persistent user identifier
- `user_id`: Customer-defined identifier for cross-platform tracking
- `device_id`: Platform-specific device identifier
- Cross-device identity resolution maintains user continuity across touchpoints

**Event Architecture**:
- Events represent discrete user actions with associated properties
- User properties are persistent attributes maintained across sessions
- Group properties enable B2B account-level analytics
- Revenue events support monetization tracking with built-in verification

**Experimentation Framework**:
- Variants define different experiment experiences
- Bucketing assigns users to variants using consistent hashing algorithms
- Exposure events track when users encounter variants
- Sequential testing enables continuous statistical monitoring without fixed sample sizes

**Analytics Measurements**:
- MTU (Monthly Tracked Users): Primary billing and usage metric
- Behavioral cohorts: Dynamic user segments based on action patterns
- Conversion windows: Time-bound analysis periods for funnel analysis
- Retention brackets: Configurable time periods for return behavior measurement

## Ecosystem Integration and Data Flow

Amplitude integrates deeply across modern data and marketing infrastructure:

**Data Warehouse Integration** provides warehouse-native analytics through native connectors for Snowflake, BigQuery, and Databricks, enabling SQL-based analysis of behavioral data alongside business intelligence tools.

**Marketing Technology Stack** integration includes attribution providers (AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch), advertising platforms (Google Ads, Facebook Ads), and marketing automation tools (Braze, Iterable, Sendgrid) for complete customer journey tracking and activation.

**Development Workflow Integration** through the Ampli CLI generates type-safe tracking code from centralized schema definitions, supporting infrastructure-as-code approaches and ensuring implementation consistency across development teams.

**Enterprise Infrastructure** supports SAML SSO, SCIM provisioning, granular permissions management, data residency controls (US/EU regions), and privacy compliance tools for GDPR and CCPA requirements.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Core API Infrastructure**:
- HTTP V2 API (`/2/httpapi`): Primary real-time event ingestion endpoint
- Batch API (`/batch`): Bulk event processing for high-volume data imports
- Export API (`/api/2/export`): Raw event data extraction with flexible filtering
- Evaluation API (`/v1/vardata`): Real-time feature flag evaluation
- Profile API: Live user profile access for personalization

**Command Line Interface**:
- `ampli pull`: Downloads and generates type-safe tracking code from schema
- `ampli status`: Validates current implementation against tracking plan
- `ampli push`: Updates implementation status and deployment tracking

**SDK Method Consistency** across all platforms:
- `track()`: Event logging with automatic batching and retry logic
- `identify()`: User property management with merge strategies
- `flush()`: Force immediate event transmission
- `variant()`: Feature flag evaluation with fallback handling

**Configuration Parameters**:
- `flushQueueSize`/`flushIntervalMillis`: Event batching optimization
- `serverZone`: Data residency compliance (US/EU)
- `trackingOptions`: Privacy control granularity
- `sessionTimeout`: Session boundary definition (default 30 minutes)
- `defaultTracking`: Automatic event collection settings

The platform represents a mature, enterprise-grade analytics ecosystem that combines sophisticated statistical capabilities with comprehensive integration options and developer-friendly implementation through automated code generation and type-safe SDKs.
