Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides businesses with behavioral analytics, feature experimentation, customer data management, and user engagement tools. The platform serves as a central hub for understanding user behavior, optimizing product experiences, and driving data-driven decision making across web, mobile, and server-side applications.

## Core Product Architecture and Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem consists of four primary product areas that work synergistically:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational behavioral analytics engine, providing event tracking, user segmentation, and advanced charting capabilities. It processes user interaction data through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, Cohort Analysis, and User Journey mapping.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities, enabling controlled feature rollouts and statistical experimentation. It integrates deeply with Analytics for experiment result analysis and includes advanced techniques for multivariate testing and statistical significance calculations.

**Amplitude CDP (Customer Data Platform)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation across the customer journey. It includes comprehensive source and destination catalogs, audience management, and data governance capabilities.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user session recordings to provide qualitative insights into user behavior patterns and friction points.

## Analytics Engine and Chart Ecosystem

The analytics platform centers around a sophisticated charting system that transforms raw event data into actionable insights:

**Event Segmentation** provides the foundational analysis capability for measuring user actions, with support for complex filtering, grouping, and mathematical operations on event properties.

**Funnel Analysis** tracks user progression through defined conversion paths, measuring drop-off rates and identifying optimization opportunities in user workflows.

**Retention Analysis** measures user return behavior over time, supporting cohort-based retention tracking and churn analysis across different user segments.

**User Journey Analysis** (Journeys) maps complete user paths through applications, identifying common navigation patterns and potential friction points.

**Lifecycle Analysis** categorizes users into behavioral segments (New, Current, Dormant, Resurrected) to understand user engagement patterns over time.

**Revenue LTV Analysis** tracks customer lifetime value and revenue attribution, connecting user behavior to business outcomes.

**Compass** provides automated insights and anomaly detection, surfacing significant changes in user behavior without manual analysis.

**Personas** creates behavioral user segments based on event patterns and user properties for targeted analysis and activation.

## Experimentation and Feature Management

Amplitude Experiment provides a complete experimentation platform with several key components:

**Feature Flag Management** enables controlled feature rollouts with percentage-based targeting, user property targeting, and cohort-based targeting capabilities.

**A/B Testing Framework** supports statistical experimentation with automatic sample size calculations, statistical significance testing, and experiment result analysis integrated with Analytics charts.

**Advanced Techniques** include multivariate testing, sequential testing, and advanced statistical methodologies for complex experimental designs.

**Experiment Theory** encompasses statistical foundations, power analysis, and experimental design principles to ensure valid and reliable test results.

## SDK and Integration Architecture

The platform provides comprehensive instrumentation through multiple SDK categories:

**Analytics SDKs** support all major platforms including Browser (JavaScript), iOS (Swift/Objective-C), Android (Java/Kotlin), React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal Engine, and server-side languages (Node.js, Python, Java, Go).

**Experiment SDKs** provide feature flag evaluation and experiment assignment across the same platform ecosystem, with client-side and server-side evaluation options.

**Ampli** serves as a type-safe wrapper around Analytics SDKs, providing compile-time validation of tracking implementations and ensuring data quality through code generation.

## API Ecosystem and Integration Points

Amplitude exposes comprehensive APIs for data ingestion, analysis, and activation:

**Analytics APIs** include the HTTP V2 API for event ingestion (`/2/httpapi`), Batch Event Upload API, and various query APIs for data extraction and analysis automation.

**Experiment APIs** provide feature flag configuration, user assignment, and experiment management capabilities for programmatic experiment control.

**Guides and Surveys API** enables in-product messaging and survey deployment for user engagement and feedback collection.

The platform also provides extensive webhook capabilities and real-time streaming options for data activation and integration with downstream systems.

## Data Management and Customer Data Platform

The CDP functionality encompasses comprehensive data orchestration:

**Source Catalog** includes 70+ integrations for data ingestion from marketing platforms, customer support tools, payment processors, and cloud data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks).

**Destination Catalog** enables data activation across marketing automation platforms, advertising networks, and business intelligence tools.

**Audiences** provides behavioral segmentation with real-time audience computation and cross-platform audience activation.

**Data Governance** includes PII management, data retention controls, and compliance frameworks for privacy regulation adherence.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

Enterprise-grade capabilities include:

**Account Management** with role-based access control, team management, and project organization structures.

**Single Sign-On** supporting SAML and OAuth integration with enterprise identity providers.

**Billing and Usage Management** with detailed usage tracking, quota management, and cost optimization tools.

**Data Governance** including data retention policies, PII handling, and compliance reporting.

## Specialized Products and Extensions

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** provides in-product messaging, user onboarding flows, and feedback collection capabilities with targeting based on behavioral data.

**Session Replay** captures user interactions for qualitative analysis, with privacy controls and integration with behavioral analytics for comprehensive user understanding.

**Web Experiment** offers specialized web-based experimentation capabilities with visual editor support and advanced targeting options.

## Developer Experience and Implementation

The platform emphasizes developer-friendly implementation through:

**Comprehensive Documentation** covering implementation guides, API references, and best practices across all supported platforms.

**Migration Tools** for transitioning from other analytics platforms with data mapping and implementation guidance.

**Troubleshooting Resources** including FAQ sections, debugging guides, and integration-specific troubleshooting documentation.

**Academy Content** providing educational resources for analytics best practices, experimental design, and platform optimization.

The platform supports both English and Japanese localization, indicating global enterprise adoption and international market focus.

Amplitude's architecture demonstrates a comprehensive approach to digital analytics that extends beyond traditional event tracking to encompass the complete customer data lifecycle, from ingestion through analysis to activation, with particular strength in behavioral analytics, statistical experimentation, and customer data orchestration.
