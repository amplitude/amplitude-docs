Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP), all unified through a robust SDK ecosystem and API infrastructure.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the core product, providing behavioral analytics through various chart types and visualization tools. The analytics engine supports Event Segmentation for analyzing user actions, Funnel Analysis for conversion tracking, Retention Analysis for user engagement measurement, and Cohort Analysis through Lifecycle charts. Advanced analytics capabilities include Compass for automated insights, Journeys for user path analysis, Impact Analysis for feature performance measurement, and Revenue LTV for monetization tracking.

**Amplitude Experiment** integrates with the analytics platform to provide feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities. It includes advanced techniques for statistical analysis, experiment theory documentation, and comprehensive result analysis through dedicated chart types. The experiment workflow encompasses planning, execution, and analysis phases with built-in statistical rigor.

**Session Replay** captures and analyzes user interactions, providing qualitative context to quantitative analytics data. This product integrates with other Amplitude tools to offer comprehensive user behavior insights.

**Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user engagement through contextual messaging, onboarding flows, and feedback collection mechanisms. It supports multiple form factors including modals, popovers, tooltips, and banners.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation through source and destination catalogs. It includes audience management, data governance features, and warehouse-native capabilities for organizations using modern data stacks.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events and Properties**: The fundamental data model consists of events (user actions) and properties (attributes describing events or users). Events are tracked through various SDKs and analyzed through chart interfaces.

**Cohorts and Segments**: User groups defined by shared characteristics or behaviors. Cohorts can be created from chart analysis and used across the platform for targeting and analysis.

**Funnels and Journeys**: Funnels represent sequential user actions with conversion analysis, while Journeys provide broader user path visualization and analysis capabilities.

**Experiments and Variants**: Controlled tests comparing different user experiences. Variants represent different versions of features or experiences being tested.

**Sources and Destinations**: Data integration points where Sources bring data into Amplitude (SDKs, third-party tools) and Destinations send data to external systems for activation.

**Charts and Dashboards**: Visualization tools where Charts represent specific analyses and Dashboards combine multiple charts for comprehensive reporting.

**Amplitude Query Language (AQL)**: The underlying query system that powers analytics, though primarily abstracted through the user interface.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The platform operates through a unified data model where all products share common user and event data. **Analytics** provides the foundational data layer that powers **Experiment** result analysis, **Session Replay** context, and **Guides and Surveys** targeting. The **CDP** manages data flow between Amplitude and external systems, enabling a complete customer data ecosystem.

**Ampli** serves as a code-generation tool that creates type-safe analytics implementations, ensuring data quality and consistency across the entire platform. This tool bridges the gap between product requirements and technical implementation.

The platform supports multi-site configurations with localization capabilities, including Japanese translation support, indicating global enterprise deployment capabilities.

## SDK Implementation and API Endpoints

The platform provides comprehensive SDK coverage across platforms:

**Analytics SDKs**:
- Browser SDK (`/sdks/analytics/browser/`) for web applications
- Mobile SDKs for iOS (`/sdks/analytics/ios/`) and Android (`/sdks/analytics/android/`)
- Server-side SDKs including Node.js (`/sdks/analytics/node/`), Python (`/sdks/analytics-sdks/python/`), Java (`/sdks/analytics/java/`), and Go (`/sdks/analytics/go/`)
- Cross-platform SDKs for React Native (`/sdks/analytics/react-native/`), Flutter (`/sdks/analytics/flutter/`), Unity (`/sdks/analytics/unity/`), and Unreal (`/sdks/analytics/unreal/`)

**Experiment SDKs** (`/sdks/experiment-sdks/`) provide feature flagging and experimentation capabilities across all supported platforms.

**API Infrastructure**:
- Analytics API (`/apis/analytics/`) for data ingestion and querying
- Experiment APIs (`/apis/experiment/`) for flag management and experiment configuration
- Guides and Surveys API (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) for in-product messaging management

**Key Integration Patterns**:
- Event tracking through `amplitude.track()` methods across SDKs
- User identification via `amplitude.setUserId()` and `amplitude.identify()`
- Experiment flag evaluation through `experiment.variant()` calls
- Real-time data streaming for immediate analysis and activation

## Advanced Capabilities and Enterprise Features

**Administration and Governance** includes comprehensive account management, billing and usage monitoring, single sign-on integration, and granular permission systems. The platform supports enterprise-scale deployments with role-based access control and audit capabilities.

**Data Management** features include PII handling and compliance tools, data validation and quality monitoring, and integration with modern data warehouses through warehouse-native capabilities.

**Migration Support** provides comprehensive tooling and documentation for transitioning from other analytics platforms, ensuring smooth enterprise adoption.

**Partner Ecosystem** extends platform capabilities through certified integrations and marketplace solutions, enabling organizations to build comprehensive growth and analytics stacks.

The platform's **Academy Content** and extensive documentation support user education and best practices adoption, while **FAQ and Troubleshooting** resources ensure successful implementation and ongoing optimization.

**Legacy Chart Support** maintains backward compatibility while encouraging migration to newer, more powerful analytics capabilities, demonstrating the platform's commitment to long-term customer success and platform evolution.
