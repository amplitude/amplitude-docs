Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products that work together to deliver end-to-end analytics, experimentation, and user engagement capabilities.

## Core Product Architecture

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, providing event tracking, user behavior analysis, and comprehensive reporting through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Cohort Analysis (Lifecycle), Revenue LTV, Stickiness, Journeys, Personas, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Data Tables, and Compass. The analytics platform supports both current and legacy chart implementations.

**Amplitude Experiment** is the feature flagging and A/B testing platform that enables controlled rollouts, multivariate testing, and advanced experimentation techniques. It includes experiment theory documentation, workflow management, troubleshooting guides, and "under the hood" technical implementation details.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and replays user sessions to provide visual insights into user interactions and identify friction points in the user experience.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** delivers in-product user engagement through contextual guides, feedback collection surveys, and resource centers for user onboarding and retention.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and distribution through source and destination catalogs, audience management, and warehouse-native capabilities.

## Multi-Platform SDK Ecosystem

The platform supports comprehensive instrumentation across multiple programming languages and frameworks:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser (JavaScript), Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine implementations, each with platform-specific routes like `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/{slug}`.

**Experiment SDKs** provide feature flagging capabilities across the same platform ecosystem with dedicated documentation at `/sdks/experiment-sdks/{slug}`.

**Ampli** serves as a type-safe wrapper that generates strongly-typed analytics libraries from Amplitude's Data taxonomy, ensuring consistent event tracking across teams and platforms.

## API Infrastructure

The platform exposes comprehensive APIs for programmatic access:

**Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/{slug}`) provides endpoints for event ingestion, user property management, and data export capabilities.

**Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/{slug}`) enable programmatic experiment management, flag evaluation, and result analysis.

**Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/{slug}`) supports in-product experience management and response collection.

## Data Management and Integration

**Source Catalog** provides pre-built integrations for data ingestion from various platforms, categorized by integration types and accessible via `/data/source-catalog/{slug}`.

**Destination Catalog** enables data export to downstream systems and tools through `/data/destination-catalog/{slug}` with taxonomy-based categorization.

**Audiences** functionality allows creation of user segments based on behavioral criteria for targeted analysis and activation.

**PII Integrations** handle personally identifiable information with appropriate privacy controls and compliance features.

**Warehouse-native Amplitude** enables direct analysis of data stored in customer data warehouses without requiring data movement.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** provides organizational controls, user permissions, and team management capabilities through `/admin/account-management/{slug}`.

**Single Sign-On (SSO)** integration supports enterprise authentication systems via `/admin/single-sign-on/{slug}`.

**Billing and Use** management tracks platform usage, quota management, and subscription details at `/admin/billing-use/{slug}`.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events**: Discrete user actions tracked within applications (clicks, page views, purchases, etc.)

**Properties**: Attributes associated with events (event properties) or users (user properties) that provide context and enable segmentation

**Cohorts/Audiences**: Groups of users defined by shared characteristics or behaviors

**Funnels**: Sequential analysis of user progression through defined steps

**Retention**: Measurement of user return behavior over time periods

**Segments**: Filtered subsets of data based on specific criteria

**Experiments**: Controlled tests comparing different user experiences or features

**Feature Flags**: Boolean or multivariate controls that enable/disable functionality for specific user groups

**Amplitude Data**: The taxonomy and governance system that ensures consistent event tracking

**Mount Points**: UUID-based content organization system that links collections to specific content hierarchies

## Content Organization and Localization

The platform uses a sophisticated collection-based content management system with mount points (UUID references) that organize documentation hierarchically. Collections support multi-site deployment (English and Japanese), propagation controls, and revision management.

**Route Patterns** follow consistent structures like `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/{slug}`, `/sdks/{product}/{platform}/{slug}`, and `/apis/{product}/{slug}`.

**Navigation Injection** uses `nav_title` properties to organize content within specific navigation contexts (analytics, experiment, data, apis, etc.).

**Localization Support** includes Japanese translation capabilities through dedicated collections and site-specific content propagation.

## Integration Ecosystem

**Partners** documentation covers third-party integrations and marketplace connections accessible via `/partners/{slug}`.

**Migration** resources assist users transitioning from other analytics platforms to Amplitude.

**Academy Content** provides educational resources and best practices for platform adoption.

**FAQ and Troubleshooting** sections offer comprehensive support documentation across all product areas.

The platform's architecture emphasizes modularity, allowing organizations to adopt individual components or the complete suite while maintaining consistent data flow and user experience across all touchpoints. The extensive SDK support and API coverage enable integration with virtually any technology stack, while the comprehensive documentation structure supports both technical implementation and business use cases.
