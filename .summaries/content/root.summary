# Amplitude Product Documentation

## Product Overview

Amplitude is an analytics and experimentation platform that helps businesses understand user behavior, optimize digital experiences, and drive growth. The platform consists of four core products:

1. **Amplitude Analytics** - The central analytics engine for understanding user behavior through charts, funnels, cohorts, and other analysis tools
2. **Amplitude Data** - Data management solution for collecting, processing, and governing user data
3. **Amplitude Experiment** - Feature flagging and experimentation platform for testing hypotheses and measuring impact
4. **Amplitude Session Replay** - Visual analytics tool for recording and replaying user sessions

## Product Relationships and Architecture

Amplitude's platform architecture is integrated and layered:

- **Data** forms the foundation, handling collection and processing
- **Analytics** builds on this data to provide insights through various visualization methods
- **Experiment** leverages analytics insights to enable targeted experimentation
- **Session Replay** adds qualitative visual context to complement quantitative analysis

These products work together to create a complete workflow: collect and process data, analyze user behavior, experiment with new features, and visually verify user experiences.
