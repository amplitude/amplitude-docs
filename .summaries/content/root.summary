Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and make data-driven decisions through four integrated core products: Analytics, Data, Experiment, and Session Replay.

## Core Product Suite and Architecture

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational product analytics engine featuring 14 specialized chart types: Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Compass, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, Revenue LTV, Data Tables, and Experiment Results. Each chart type provides distinct analytical capabilities for examining different dimensions of user behavior and product performance.

**Amplitude Data** functions as the Customer Data Platform (CDP) layer, delivering robust data integration through Sources and Destinations catalogs, Audiences management, and warehouse-native functionality. The platform manages comprehensive data pipelines with PII integrations and extensive third-party connectivity.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides advanced A/B testing and feature flagging capabilities utilizing sophisticated statistical methodologies including sequential testing, advanced targeting, and comprehensive workflow management. The platform supports both remote and local evaluation modes with extensive SDK coverage.

**Session Replay** delivers qualitative user experience analysis by reconstructing complete digital user sessions for debugging and optimization.

## Technical Implementation Framework

The platform operates through multiple integration layers with comprehensive SDK ecosystem coverage:

**Analytics SDKs** span Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal implementations, while **Experiment SDKs** provide dedicated experimentation capabilities. **Ampli** delivers type-safe analytics implementation, and specialized framework integrations support popular development environments.

**API Infrastructure** enables programmatic access through:
- **Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/`) for data ingestion and retrieval
- **Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) for experimentation management  
- **Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) for in-product messaging

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Collections Structure** organizes content through hierarchical collections with routing patterns supporting `template`, `layout`, `mount`, `route`, `preview_targets`, and `inject` configurations for content management and navigation.

**Navigation Taxonomy** includes categories: `analytics`, `data`, `experiment`, `apis`, `analytics_sdks`, `experiment_sdks`, `charts`, `get_started`, `admin`, `faq`, and specialized product area classifications.

**Site Management** supports multi-site configuration with `sites: [en, jp]` and `propagate` settings for cross-locale content distribution.

**Content Mounting** utilizes `mount` UUIDs for establishing content relationships and hierarchical organization, enabling complex documentation structures with parent-child relationships.

## Statistical and Experimentation Framework

Amplitude Experiment implements advanced statistical methodologies including **mixture sequential probability ratio test (mSPRT)** for continuous experiment monitoring, **mutual exclusion groups** for preventing user overlap, **holdout groups** for incrementality testing, and **flag dependencies** for complex experiment relationships.

The platform supports **bucketing processes** using deterministic randomization, **exposure tracking** for accurate measurement, and rigorous **experiment theory** foundations for statistical inference.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** (`/admin/account-management/`) provides organizational controls, **Billing and Use** (`/admin/billing-use/`) handles subscription management, and **Single Sign-on** (`/admin/single-sign-on/`) enables enterprise authentication integration.

**Partners** ecosystem (`/partners/`) facilitates third-party integrations and marketplace connectivity.

## Content and Learning Resources

**Academy Content** provides educational materials, **Guides and Surveys** (`/guides-and-surveys/`) offers in-product messaging capabilities, **FAQ and Troubleshooting** (`/faq/`) sections deliver comprehensive support documentation, and **Migration** resources (`/migration/`) assist with platform transitions.

## Global and Localization Support

The platform supports internationalization through **Japanese Translation** collections with dedicated routing and navigation structures, demonstrating enterprise-grade localization capabilities.

## Route Structure and URL Patterns

The platform employs systematic URL routing:
- Analytics: `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/{slug}`
- Data: `/data/{feature}/{slug}`
- Experiment: `/feature-experiment/{category}/{slug}`
- SDKs: `/sdks/{platform}/{slug}`
- APIs: `/apis/{service}/{slug}`

This unified architecture enables organizations to implement sophisticated product analytics, experimentation, and data management workflows with extensive customization and integration capabilities across the entire digital product lifecycle.
