Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with advanced tools for understanding user behavior, optimizing product experiences, and driving data-informed decision making across web and mobile applications.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of four primary product areas: **Analytics** (behavioral analysis and reporting), **Experiment** (feature flagging and A/B testing), **Data** (customer data platform and integrations), and **Session Replay** (user session recording and analysis). These products work together through a unified data layer that processes events, user properties, and behavioral patterns to deliver actionable insights.

The analytics engine centers around **Charts** - specialized visualization and analysis tools including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Personas, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Revenue LTV, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Data Tables, and Compass. Each chart type serves specific analytical use cases, from basic event tracking to sophisticated cohort analysis and revenue attribution modeling.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational layer, collecting and processing user behavioral data through comprehensive SDK instrumentation across platforms (Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal, Node.js, Python, Java, Go). The **Ampli** wrapper provides type-safe event tracking with code generation capabilities for consistent implementation across development teams.

**Amplitude Experiment** builds upon the analytics foundation to deliver feature flagging, A/B testing, and advanced experimentation capabilities. It includes experiment design tools, statistical analysis engines, results visualization, and integration with the analytics platform for comprehensive impact measurement. The experiment workflow encompasses hypothesis formation, variant configuration, audience targeting, and statistical significance testing.

**Amplitude Data** (CDP) functions as the central data orchestration layer, managing data ingestion through the **Source Catalog**, data activation through the **Destination Catalog**, audience creation and management, and warehouse-native analytics capabilities. This enables organizations to unify customer data across touchpoints and activate insights through downstream marketing and operational systems.

**Session Replay** captures and reconstructs user interactions for qualitative analysis, complementing quantitative analytics with visual context for understanding user behavior patterns, identifying friction points, and validating experiment results.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** represent discrete user actions or system occurrences that are tracked and analyzed. Events contain properties (attributes describing the event context) and are associated with users through unique identifiers.

**Metrics** are quantitative measurements derived from event data, including Uniques (distinct user counts), Event totals (occurrence frequencies), Session totals, PROPSUM (property value summations), and PROPCOUNT (property occurrence counts).

**Cohorts** and **Audiences** represent user segments created based on behavioral criteria, demographic attributes, or calculated properties. These segments can be used for analysis, experimentation, and activation across integrated platforms.

**Experiments** encompass feature flags, A/B tests, and multivariate tests with statistical frameworks for measuring impact on key metrics. Experiment configurations include variant definitions, traffic allocation, audience targeting, and success criteria.

**Attribution Models** distribute conversion credit across multiple touchpoints using algorithms like First Touch, Last Touch, Linear, U-Shaped, and Data-Driven Markov chain approaches for marketing campaign analysis.

**Session Metrics** include bounce rates, exit rates, entry rates, and time-based calculations derived from user session boundaries (typically 30-minute timeout windows between events).

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates extensively with external platforms through its **Partner** ecosystem, supporting marketing tools, customer success platforms, data warehouses, and business intelligence solutions. The **APIs** (Analytics API, Experiment APIs, Guides and Surveys API) enable programmatic access to platform functionality for custom integrations and automated workflows.

**Guides and Surveys** extends the platform with in-product messaging and feedback collection capabilities, enabling organizations to gather qualitative insights alongside quantitative behavioral data.

The platform supports enterprise requirements through **Single Sign-On** integration, **Account Management** tools, **Billing and Use** monitoring, and comprehensive **Admin** controls for user permissions, project management, and organizational governance.

## Technical Implementation and Access Patterns

The platform exposes functionality through multiple interfaces: web-based analytics dashboards, REST APIs for programmatic access, SDK implementations for event tracking, and CSV export capabilities for data extraction. Route patterns follow consistent structures like `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/{slug}`, `/sdks/{platform}/{slug}`, `/apis/{product}/{slug}`, and `/data/{feature}/{slug}`.

**Migration** tools and documentation support transitions from other analytics platforms, while **FAQ and Troubleshooting** resources provide implementation guidance. The platform includes specialized troubleshooting for experiment implementation and **PII Integrations** for handling sensitive data requirements.

**Academy Content** and educational resources support user onboarding and advanced technique development, with **Japanese Translation** support for international deployments.
