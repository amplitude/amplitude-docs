Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools for understanding user behavior, optimizing product experiences, and driving growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of several interconnected products that work together to deliver end-to-end analytics, experimentation, and user engagement capabilities.

## Core Product Architecture

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, providing event tracking, user behavior analysis, and business intelligence through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Revenue LTV, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Impact Analysis, and Engagement Matrix. The analytics platform supports both current and legacy chart implementations with specialized visualization capabilities.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced statistical analysis, including experiment theory, workflow management, results analysis, and troubleshooting tools. The platform supports sophisticated experimentation methodologies with integration across the broader Amplitude ecosystem.

**Amplitude Session Replay** provides user session recording and analysis capabilities, enabling teams to observe actual user interactions and identify friction points in the user experience.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** offers in-product user engagement tools for onboarding, feedback collection, and user guidance through contextual experiences.

## Multi-Platform SDK Ecosystem

The platform provides comprehensive SDK coverage across multiple programming languages and platforms:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser SDK, Android SDK, iOS SDK, React Native SDK, Flutter SDK, Node.js SDK, Python SDK, Java SDK, Go SDK, Unity SDK, and Unreal SDK, each with platform-specific routing patterns (e.g., `/sdks/analytics/browser/{slug}`, `/sdks/analytics/android/{slug}`).

**Experiment SDKs** provide dedicated experimentation capabilities with their own routing structure (`/sdks/experiment-sdks/{slug}`).

**Ampli** serves as a type-safe analytics wrapper that generates strongly-typed tracking libraries, accessible via `/sdks/ampli/{slug}`.

## Data Management and Integration

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** capabilities include comprehensive data management through Sources and Destinations, with extensive catalog support for third-party integrations. The platform provides:

- **Source Catalog** (`/data/source-catalog/{slug}`) for data ingestion from various platforms
- **Destination Catalog** (`/data/destination-catalog/{slug}`) for data activation and export
- **Audiences** (`/data/audiences/{slug}`) for user segmentation and targeting
- **Warehouse-native Amplitude** for direct data warehouse integration
- **PII Integrations** for privacy-compliant data handling

## API Infrastructure

The platform exposes multiple API endpoints for programmatic access:

- **Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/{slug}`) for core analytics functionality
- **Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/{slug}`) for experimentation management
- **Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/{slug}`) for engagement tool management

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** (`/admin/account-management/{slug}`) provides organizational controls, user management, and access governance.

**Single Sign-on** (`/admin/single-sign-on/{slug}`) enables enterprise authentication integration.

**Billing and Use** (`/admin/billing-use/{slug}`) offers usage monitoring and cost management capabilities.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Collections** represent content organization structures within the documentation system, each with specific routing patterns, template configurations, and navigation injection points.

**Mount Points** (identified by UUIDs like `ba956cb4-9ae1-456a-b122-984b491048f6`) establish content relationships and hierarchical structures within the documentation system.

**Navigation Injection** uses standardized labels (`analytics`, `experiment`, `data`, `apis`, `admin`, etc.) to organize content within the broader navigation structure.

**Blade Identifiers** specify product-specific branding and context (e.g., "Amplitude Experiment", "Amplitude Session Replay", "Amplitude Guides and Surveys").

**Site Propagation** controls content distribution across different locales (`en`, `jp`) with propagation flags determining content inheritance patterns.

## Internationalization and Localization

The platform supports multiple languages with dedicated Japanese translation capabilities (`/japanese_translation.yaml`) and locale-specific routing patterns. Content can be configured for specific sites with propagation controls for managing translated content distribution.

## Partner Ecosystem and Integration

**Partners** collection (`/partners/{slug}`) provides integration documentation and partnership-related content, supporting the broader ecosystem of third-party integrations and collaborative implementations.

**Migration** tools and documentation (`/migration/{slug}`) assist organizations in transitioning from other analytics platforms to Amplitude.

The platform's architecture demonstrates a comprehensive approach to product analytics, combining real-time event tracking, advanced statistical analysis, user engagement tools, and enterprise-grade data management capabilities. The extensive SDK support and API infrastructure enable organizations to implement Amplitude across diverse technology stacks while maintaining consistent data collection and analysis capabilities.
