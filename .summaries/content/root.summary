Amplitude is a comprehensive customer intelligence platform that unifies behavioral analytics, experimentation, and customer engagement capabilities to help organizations understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive business growth through data-driven insights.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of five interconnected products that work together to provide end-to-end customer intelligence:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational behavioral analytics engine, offering 15+ specialized chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, Revenue LTV, and Experiment Results. Each chart type addresses specific analytical use cases from basic event tracking to complex user journey analysis and revenue attribution.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced statistical methods, sophisticated targeting mechanisms, and comprehensive result analysis. The platform supports complex experimentation workflows with statistical rigor and seamless integration with Analytics for result visualization.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures granular user interactions to provide qualitative insights that complement quantitative analytics data, enabling teams to understand not just what users do, but how they interact with products.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** functions as an in-product engagement platform that replaces traditional popup systems with contextual messaging experiences. It supports interactive guides, feedback collection surveys, and intelligent resource centers with behavioral targeting and personalization capabilities.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages the entire data lifecycle through comprehensive source and destination catalogs, audience management, and warehouse-native capabilities, enabling organizations to unify customer data across touchpoints and activate insights through downstream systems.

## Multi-Platform SDK and Integration Framework

Amplitude provides extensive SDK coverage across all major development environments:

**Analytics SDKs** span Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal implementations. Each SDK is optimized for platform-specific requirements and handles event tracking, user identification, session management, and real-time data transmission.

**Experiment SDKs** enable feature flag evaluation and experiment participation across the same platform matrix, supporting both server-side and client-side implementations with advanced targeting, variant assignment, and exposure tracking capabilities.

**Ampli** represents Amplitude's type-safe analytics solution that generates strongly-typed tracking libraries from centrally defined tracking plans, ensuring data quality and developer experience consistency across teams and platforms.

**Framework Integrations** provide specialized support for popular development frameworks, reducing implementation complexity and accelerating developer adoption.

## API Ecosystem and Technical Integration

The platform exposes comprehensive APIs for programmatic access and automation:

**Analytics APIs** include the HTTP V2 API for event ingestion, Identify API for user property management, and various export APIs for data extraction. These enable real-time data collection and bulk data operations.

**Experiment APIs** provide programmatic control over feature flags, experiment configuration, and result retrieval, supporting automated experiment management and CI/CD pipeline integration.

**Guides and Surveys API** allows programmatic management of in-product messaging campaigns, content creation, and performance analytics.

The API ecosystem supports both REST and streaming patterns with comprehensive authentication mechanisms including API keys and OAuth implementations.

## Data Management and Activation

**Source Catalog** encompasses over 100 integrations for data ingestion from marketing tools, customer support systems, payment processors, and other analytics platforms. Each integration includes specific configuration requirements, data mapping capabilities, and synchronization patterns.

**Destination Catalog** features comprehensive data activation capabilities, enabling behavioral data export to marketing automation platforms, advertising networks, data warehouses, and customer engagement tools through event streaming, cohort synchronization, and bulk data export patterns.

**Audiences** provide sophisticated user segmentation based on behavioral patterns, demographic attributes, and custom properties. Audiences are dynamically updated and can be synchronized across the destination ecosystem for targeted marketing and personalization.

**PII Integrations** ensure privacy compliance through specialized handling of personally identifiable information, including data masking, encryption, and selective data processing capabilities.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** are discrete user actions or system occurrences tracked for analysis, including properties that provide additional context for segmentation and analysis.

**User Properties** are persistent attributes associated with individual users that enable cohort analysis and personalization across sessions.

**Cohorts** are dynamic user segments based on behavioral patterns, demographic attributes, or custom criteria used for targeting and analysis.

**Experiments** are controlled tests comparing different product experiences to measure impact on key metrics, supported by statistical analysis and confidence intervals.

**Feature Flags** enable controlled feature rollouts with targeting capabilities and real-time configuration management.

**Instrumentation** refers to the implementation of tracking code and data collection mechanisms across digital products and platforms.

## Enterprise and Administrative Features

**Account Management** provides organizational controls including user management, permission systems, project organization, and billing oversight, supporting enterprise-scale deployments with sophisticated access controls and audit capabilities.

**Single Sign-On (SSO)** integration enables enterprise authentication through SAML, OAuth, and other identity provider systems for secure access management aligned with organizational security policies.

**Billing and Usage** management provides detailed consumption tracking, cost allocation, and usage optimization tools for effective platform cost management.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude positions itself as the central nervous system for customer intelligence, integrating with the broader marketing technology, product development, and data infrastructure ecosystem. The platform's extensive source and destination catalogs enable it to serve as both a data aggregation point and an activation hub, while the SDK ecosystem ensures comprehensive data collection across all customer touchpoints.

The unified architecture allows behavioral insights from Analytics to inform Experiment targeting, Session Replay findings to guide Guides and Surveys messaging, and CDP audiences to activate personalized experiences across the entire customer journey. This interconnected approach enables organizations to implement sophisticated data-driven product development and marketing strategies while maintaining data quality and governance standards across their technology stack.
