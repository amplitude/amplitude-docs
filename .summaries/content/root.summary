# Amplitude Product Documentation

## Product Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform designed to help businesses understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth. The platform provides tools for tracking user interactions, analyzing product performance, conducting experiments, collecting user feedback, and visualizing user sessions.

Key features include:
- Detailed analytics for tracking user behavior and product performance
- A/B testing and feature experimentation capabilities
- In-product messaging and feedback collection through guides and surveys
- Visual recording of user sessions for deeper behavioral insights
- Robust data management tools for collection, integration, and governance

Amplitude supports various use cases including product optimization, user engagement analysis, conversion rate improvement, feature experimentation, and data-driven decision making.

## Product Relationships and Features

The Amplitude ecosystem consists of several interconnected products:

1. **Analytics Core**
   - Charts (Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys)
   - Compass for understanding user behavior patterns
   - Data Tables for tabular visualization and analysis

2. **Data Collection and Management**
   - Multiple SDKs across platforms (Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity)
   - Ampli for type-safe analytics implementation
   - Sources for external data ingestion
   - Destinations for data export
   - Audiences for user segmentation
   - Customer Data Platform (CDP) capabilities
   - PII management tools

3. **Experimentation Platform**
   - Web Experiment for A/B testing
   - Experiment SDKs and APIs
   - Advanced experimentation techniques
   - Experiment workflow management

4. **User Experience Tools**
   - Guides and Surveys for in-product messaging
   - Session Replay for visual recording of user interactions

5. **Administration**
   - Account management
   - Billing and usage tracking
   - Single Sign-On configuration

These products work together to create a cohesive analytics and experimentation ecosystem. For example, experiments created in the Experimentation platform can be analyzed using Analytics charts, while Guide and Survey interactions generate analytics events that can be tracked and analyzed.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Analytics Terms
- **Event**: A tracked user action or system occurrence
- **Property**: Metadata associated with events
- **User Property**: Attributes associated with specific users
- **Cohort**: A group of users sharing common characteristics
- **Funnel**: A sequence of events representing a user journey
- **Retention**: Measurement of user return behavior over time
- **Session**: A period of continuous user activity

### Experimentation Terms
- **Experiment**: A controlled test comparing different variations
- **Variant**: A specific version being tested in an experiment
- **Flag**: A feature toggle controlling experiment exposure
- **Targeting**: Rules determining which users see which variants
- **Evaluation**: Process of determining which variant to show a user

### Data Management Terms
- **Source**: Origin point for data ingestion
- **Destination**: Endpoint for data export
- **Integration**: Connection between Amplitude and another system
- **Taxonomy**: Organizational structure of events and properties
- **Tracking Plan**: Specification for what events to track and how

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's platform is designed as an integrated ecosystem where data flows between products:

1. **Analytics + Experiment**: Experiment results feed directly into Analytics for analysis
2. **Analytics + Guides and Surveys**: User interactions with guides and surveys generate analytics events
3. **Data Management + Analytics**: Data collected through SDKs and integrations powers analytics capabilities
4. **Session Replay + Analytics**: Session recordings link to user profiles and specific events
5. **Experiment + Guides and Surveys**: In-product messaging can be A/B tested using the Experiment platform

The platform also connects with external systems through:
- Data warehouse integrations
- API access for programmatic data management
- SDK ecosystem supporting various platforms and languages

## API and SDK References

### Analytics API
- Base URL: `/apis/analytics/`
- Key endpoints for querying analytics data, managing cohorts, and accessing user profiles

### Experiment API
- Base URL: `/apis/experiment/`
- Endpoints for managing experiments, flags, and retrieving results

### Guides and Surveys API
- Base URL: `/apis/guides-and-surveys/`
- Endpoints for creating and managing in-product messages and surveys

### SDK Implementation Examples
```javascript
// Browser SDK example
amplitude.init('API_KEY');
amplitude.track('Event Name', {property: 'value'});
```

```swift
// iOS SDK example
Amplitude.instance().initializeApiKey("API_KEY")
Amplitude.instance().logEvent("Event Name", withEventProperties: ["property": "value"])
```

The Ampli SDK provides code generation for type-safe analytics implementation, ensuring consistent event tracking across client applications regardless of platform.
