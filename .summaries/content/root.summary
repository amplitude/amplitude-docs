## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Analytics Concepts**:
- **Events** - User actions or behaviors tracked within applications
- **Properties** - Attributes associated with events or users
- **Cohorts** - Groups of users defined by shared characteristics or behaviors
- **Segments** - Filtered subsets of users or events for analysis
- **Funnels** - Sequential steps in a user journey or conversion process
- **Retention** - Measurement of user return behavior over time
- **LTV (Lifetime Value)** - Total value generated by a user over their relationship with the product

**Experiment Terminology**:
- **Feature Flags** - Boolean toggles that control feature availability
- **Variants** - Different versions of features being tested
- **Allocation** - Distribution of users across experiment variants
- **Statistical Significance** - Confidence level in experiment results
- **Lift** - Percentage improvement in key metrics

**Data Infrastructure**:
- **Sources** - Systems that send data to Amplitude
- **Destinations** - Systems that receive data from Amplitude
- **Transformations** - Data processing and enrichment rules
- **Schemas** - Data structure definitions and validation rules
- **Tracking Plans** - Centralized event taxonomy and governance

**SDK and Implementation**:
- **Instrumentation** - Code implementation for data collection
- **Ampli** - Type-safe SDK wrapper with code generation
- **Autocapture** - Automatic event tracking without manual instrumentation
- **Session Management** - User session definition and tracking
- **Device ID** - Unique device identification for analytics
- **User ID** - Custom user identification for cross-device tracking

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude platform integrates with a vast ecosystem of tools and platforms through its Source and Destination catalogs. The CDP serves as the central hub for data orchestration, enabling organizations to:

- **Ingest data** from marketing tools, customer support platforms, payment processors, and other business systems
- **Activate audiences** by sending user segments to advertising platforms, email marketing tools, and personalization engines
- **Sync data** with data warehouses like Snowflake, BigQuery, and Redshift for advanced analytics

The platform supports both real-time and batch data processing, with robust privacy controls including GDPR and CCPA compliance features. Multi-site support enables global organizations to manage data residency requirements across different regions.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Analytics APIs**:
- **HTTP API v2** (`/2/httpapi`) - Primary event ingestion endpoint
- **Export API** - Raw data export for custom analysis
- **Dashboard REST API** - Programmatic access to charts and dashboards
- **Cohort API** - User segment management and synchronization

**Experiment APIs**:
- **Evaluation API** - Real-time feature flag and experiment evaluation
- **Management API** - Experiment configuration and management
- **Results API** - Experiment results and statistical analysis

**Guides and Surveys API**:
- Campaign management and targeting
- Response collection and analysis

**SDK Implementation**:
The platform provides comprehensive SDKs for multiple platforms:
- **Analytics SDKs**: Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, Unreal
- **Experiment SDKs**: Platform-specific SDKs for feature flag evaluation
- **Ampli**: Code generation tool creating type-safe wrappers

**Key Configuration Options**:
- `flushIntervalMillis` - Event batching and transmission timing
- `flushQueueSize` - Queue size thresholds for event transmission  
- `sessionTimeoutMillis` - Session boundary definition
- `serverZone` - Data residency control (US/EU)
- `trackingOptions` - Privacy and data collection controls
- `autocapture` - Automatic event tracking configuration

**Command Line Tools**:
- `ampli pull` - Download tracking plans and generate code
- `ampli status` - Validate implementation against tracking plans
- Migration utilities for SDK upgrades and data transfer

The platform architecture supports both simple implementations for small teams and complex enterprise deployments with advanced governance, privacy controls, and custom integrations. The modular design allows organizations to adopt individual products or implement the complete Amplitude suite based on their analytics and experimentation needs.
