# Amplitude Lifecycle Chart

## Overview
The Lifecycle chart is an analytics feature in Amplitude that provides comprehensive visualization and analysis of user activity patterns. It helps product teams track user engagement, retention, and growth by categorizing users into distinct segments based on their activity status. The Lifecycle chart is available to customers on Amplitude's Growth and Enterprise plans.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Views
The Lifecycle chart offers three distinct views to analyze user behavior:

1. **Growth View (Default)** - Focuses on active users, categorizing them into new, current, and resurrected segments to track user base growth.
2. **Dormant View** - Highlights users who have become inactive, helping identify churn patterns.
3. **Pulse View** - Provides a ratio of active users to dormant users, offering a quick health metric of user engagement.

### User Categorization
The Lifecycle chart segments users into four distinct categories:

- **New Users** - Users who performed the selected event for the first time during the current interval.
- **Current Users** - Users who were active both in the current interval and the previous interval.
- **Resurrected Users** - Users who were active in the current interval after being inactive for at least one previous interval.
- **Dormant Users** - Users who were active in the previous interval but not in the current interval.

### Time Intervals
The Lifecycle chart supports multiple time interval options:
- Daily
- Weekly
- Monthly

These intervals determine how user activity is grouped and analyzed, allowing teams to examine patterns at different time scales.

### Analysis Capabilities
- **Critical Event Tracking** - Teams can select specific events to analyze user engagement around key actions.
- **Event Property Filtering** - Allows for more granular analysis by filtering events based on specific properties.
- **Retention Analysis** - Helps identify patterns of user churn and re-engagement.
- **Activity Distribution** - Visualizes user activity through histograms.
- **Breakdown Table Export** - Enables exporting detailed data for further analysis.

## Pulse Ratio Formula
The Pulse ratio is calculated as: (New + Current + Resurrected Users) ÷ Dormant Users

This ratio serves as a health metric for user engagement, with higher values indicating stronger growth and retention.

## Use Cases
- Tracking overall user base growth
- Identifying retention issues
- Analyzing engagement patterns around critical product events
- Understanding seasonal or cyclical user behavior
- Measuring the impact of product changes on user activity
- Comparing engagement across different user segments

## Integration in Amplitude Ecosystem
The Lifecycle chart is part of Amplitude's analytics suite, complementing other retention and engagement analysis tools. It provides a visual representation of user activity that helps teams understand how users interact with their product over time, supporting data-driven product development decisions.

The chart data can be exported for deeper analysis or integration with other business intelligence tools, allowing teams to incorporate lifecycle insights into broader analytics workflows.
