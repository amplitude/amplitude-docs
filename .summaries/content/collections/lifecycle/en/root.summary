## Amplitude Lifecycle Analytics

Amplitude Lifecycle is a comprehensive user growth and retention analytics feature that provides deep insights into user base evolution by categorizing users into distinct behavioral segments. This analytics tool enables product teams to track user engagement patterns, measure growth effectiveness, and understand user retention dynamics through sophisticated segmentation and visualization capabilities.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

The Lifecycle feature operates as an integrated component within Amplitude's broader analytics platform, spanning three core modules:

**Events Module Integration**: Serves as the foundation by defining the critical events that determine user activity status. Users configure starting events that trigger lifecycle tracking, establishing the behavioral baseline for user categorization.

**Segmentation Module Integration**: Enables targeted analysis by allowing users to apply specific user segments to lifecycle tracking. This integration provides granular control over which user populations are included in lifecycle analysis, supporting cohort-based and demographic-specific insights.

**Metrics Module Integration**: Controls temporal analysis parameters through usage interval configuration (daily, weekly, monthly), determining the time windows for user activity assessment and lifecycle state transitions.

The Lifecycle chart functions as both a standalone analytical tool and a complementary feature to Amplitude's retention and engagement analytics suite, providing multiple visualization modes to accommodate different analytical perspectives.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**User Lifecycle States**:
- **New Users**: First-time users performing the tracked event within the specified interval
- **Current Users**: Previously active users who continue engagement in the current period
- **Resurrected Users**: Previously dormant users who return to activity after a period of inactivity
- **Dormant Users**: Previously active users who have ceased engagement with the tracked event

**Chart Visualization Modes**:
- **Growth View**: Primary histogram visualization displaying active user segments with dormant user overlay
- **Dormant View**: Focused analysis of user churn and dormancy patterns
- **Pulse View**: Ratio-based visualization showing the relationship between active and total user populations

**Analytical Components**:
- **Usage Intervals**: Configurable time periods (daily, weekly, monthly) that define activity measurement windows
- **Critical Events**: User-defined actions that determine active vs. inactive user status
- **Pulse Ratio**: Calculated metric representing active users as a percentage of total user base
- **Breakdown Table**: Exportable data view providing detailed numerical analysis of lifecycle segments

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Lifecycle analytics integrates into Amplitude's enterprise analytics ecosystem as a Growth and Enterprise plan feature, positioning it as an advanced analytical capability for organizations requiring sophisticated user behavior analysis. The feature connects with Amplitude's broader retention framework, complementing funnel analysis, cohort studies, and user journey mapping.

The tool supports data export functionality through breakdown tables, enabling integration with external business intelligence systems and custom reporting workflows. This export capability facilitates cross-platform analysis and supports organizations using Amplitude as part of a larger analytics technology stack.

## Technical Implementation

The Lifecycle feature operates through Amplitude's standard chart interface with specialized configuration options:

**Configuration Workflow**:
1. Event selection in Events Module for activity definition
2. User segment application in Segmentation Module for population targeting
3. Usage interval specification in Metrics Module for temporal analysis
4. Chart view selection for visualization preference

**Data Processing**: The system processes user activity data against defined events and intervals, automatically categorizing users into lifecycle states based on engagement patterns and historical activity records.

**Visualization Options**: Users can switch between Growth, Dormant, and Pulse chart views within the same analysis, providing multiple analytical perspectives on identical datasets without requiring reconfiguration of underlying parameters.
