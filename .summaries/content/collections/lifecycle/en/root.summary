# Amplitude Lifecycle Analysis

## Product Overview

Amplitude's Lifecycle feature is an analytics tool designed to help product teams understand user activity patterns and track user base growth over time. The Lifecycle chart categorizes users into distinct segments based on their engagement patterns, enabling teams to gain insights into user retention, churn, and reactivation.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Lifecycle Views
- **Growth View (Default)**: Categorizes active users as new, current, or resurrected while tracking dormant users
- **Dormant View**: Focuses on users who have become inactive
- **Pulse View**: Provides a ratio of users entering vs. exiting the active user base

### User Categorization
- **New Users**: Users who performed the tracked event for the first time in the current interval
- **Current Users**: Users who performed the event in both the current and previous intervals
- **Resurrected Users**: Users who performed the event in the current interval but not in the previous one (and are not new)
- **Dormant Users**: Users who performed the event in the previous interval but not in the current one

### Analysis Capabilities
- **Customizable Time Intervals**: Analyze user behavior across different time periods (daily, weekly, monthly)
- **Critical Event Tracking**: Focus analysis on specific important events that define active usage
- **Histogram Visualization**: Visual representation of user activity patterns
- **Breakdown Table**: Detailed data view showing user segments and metrics
- **Segmentation**: Ability to analyze specific user cohorts based on properties and behaviors

## Product Relationships and Ecosystem

The Lifecycle feature appears to be part of Amplitude's broader analytics platform, specifically available to users on Growth and Enterprise plans. It integrates with Amplitude's core event tracking and user segmentation capabilities, allowing teams to:

1. Define critical events that represent meaningful user engagement
2. Track how different user segments move through the lifecycle stages
3. Identify patterns in user retention and churn
4. Measure the effectiveness of reactivation efforts for dormant users

The Lifecycle analysis complements other Amplitude features by providing a specific lens for understanding user engagement patterns over time, which can inform retention strategies and growth initiatives.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Critical Event**: The specific user action being tracked to determine active status
- **Usage Interval**: The time period for analysis (daily, weekly, monthly)
- **Pulse Ratio**: A formula measuring the ratio of users entering vs. exiting the active user base
- **Growth Chart**: The default visualization showing the breakdown of active users
- **Dormant Users**: Previously active users who have not performed the critical event in the current period
- **Event Properties**: Attributes associated with events that can be used for more granular analysis

## Technical Implementation

While specific API endpoints aren't explicitly mentioned in the documentation, the Lifecycle feature appears to be accessed through Amplitude's analytics dashboard interface, where users can:

1. Select the Lifecycle chart type
2. Configure the critical event to track
3. Set the appropriate time interval for analysis
4. Apply segmentation filters as needed
5. Switch between Growth, Dormant, and Pulse views
6. Export or share the resulting analysis

The feature leverages Amplitude's event tracking infrastructure to categorize users based on their interaction patterns with the specified critical events.
