# Amplitude Lifecycle Analysis

## Product Overview

Amplitude's Lifecycle feature is an analytics tool designed to help product teams understand user activity patterns, track user base growth, and analyze retention metrics. The Lifecycle chart categorizes users into distinct segments based on their activity status, providing insights into how users engage with a product over time.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Lifecycle Views
- **Growth View (Default)**: Focuses on active users categorized as new, current, or resurrected
- **Dormant View**: Tracks users who have become inactive
- **Pulse View**: Measures the ratio of returning users (current + resurrected) to churned users (dormant)

### User Categorization
- **New Users**: Users who performed the tracked event for the first time in the current interval
- **Current Users**: Users who performed the event in both the current and previous intervals
- **Resurrected Users**: Users who performed the event in the current interval but not in the previous one, and have performed it at some point before
- **Dormant Users**: Users who performed the event in the previous interval but not in the current one

### Analysis Capabilities
- Customizable time intervals (daily, weekly, or monthly)
- Tracking around critical events
- Segmentation by user properties
- Breakdown tables for detailed analysis
- Histogram visualization of user activity patterns

## Product Relationships and Features

The Lifecycle chart is part of Amplitude's analytics suite and appears to be available specifically to Growth and Enterprise plan customers. It integrates with Amplitude's broader event tracking system, allowing teams to:

1. Define critical events to track user engagement
2. Apply user properties and event properties for segmentation
3. Customize analysis intervals to match product usage patterns
4. Visualize user activity through multiple views (Growth, Dormant, Pulse)

The tool is designed to work alongside other Amplitude features, leveraging the platform's event tracking capabilities to provide specialized retention and growth analysis.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Critical Event**: The specific user action being tracked to determine activity status
- **Usage Interval**: The time period for analysis (daily, weekly, or monthly)
- **Growth Chart**: The default view showing active user segments
- **Dormant Chart**: View focusing on users who have stopped activity
- **Pulse Ratio**: Metric comparing returning users to churned users
- **Histogram Visualization**: Chart type used to display user activity patterns
- **Breakdown Table**: Detailed data view showing metrics by segment

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Lifecycle feature appears to be an analytical tool within Amplitude's broader product analytics platform. It:

1. Relies on Amplitude's event tracking infrastructure to collect user activity data
2. Complements other retention and engagement analysis tools in the platform
3. Supports product teams in understanding user behavior patterns
4. Helps identify retention issues and growth opportunities

The documentation suggests that Lifecycle analysis is a specialized visualization and analytical approach built on top of Amplitude's core event tracking capabilities, specifically designed for teams focused on user retention and growth metrics.

## Usage

The Lifecycle chart can be accessed through the Amplitude interface and configured by:
- Selecting a critical event to track
- Choosing an appropriate time interval (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Applying relevant user or event properties for segmentation
- Switching between Growth, Dormant, and Pulse views as needed for analysis

The feature appears to be a visual analytics tool rather than an API or command-line utility, accessed through Amplitude's web interface.
