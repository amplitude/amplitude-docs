# Amplitude Lifecycle Analysis

## Product Overview

Amplitude's Lifecycle feature is an analytics tool designed to help product teams understand user activity patterns and track user base growth over time. The Lifecycle chart provides a comprehensive view of user engagement by categorizing active users into distinct segments and visualizing their movement between these segments across customizable time intervals.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Lifecycle Views
- **Growth View (Default)**: Categorizes active users as new, current, or resurrected while tracking dormant users
- **Dormant View**: Focuses on users who have become inactive
- **Pulse View**: Measures the ratio of users entering vs. exiting the active user base

### User Categorization
- **New Users**: Users who performed the selected event for the first time during the current interval
- **Current Users**: Users who performed the event in both the current and previous intervals
- **Resurrected Users**: Users who performed the event in the current interval but not in the previous interval (and are not new)
- **Dormant Users**: Users who performed the event in the previous interval but not in the current one

### Visualization Options
- **Histogram Visualization**: Shows user counts across different categories
- **Breakdown Table**: Provides detailed data on user segments

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Critical Event**: The specific user action being tracked in the Lifecycle analysis
- **Usage Interval**: The time period for analyzing user activity (customizable)
- **Pulse Ratio**: A formula measuring the ratio of users entering vs. exiting the active user base
- **Active Users**: Combined total of new, current, and resurrected users

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Lifecycle feature appears to be part of Amplitude's broader analytics platform, specifically available in Growth and Enterprise plans. It integrates with Amplitude's user segmentation capabilities, allowing teams to:

- Analyze which user segments most impact active user metrics
- Track engagement patterns around critical events
- Identify retention issues over time
- Understand user movement between activity states

## Usage

While specific API endpoints or command line invocations aren't explicitly mentioned in the documentation, the Lifecycle chart appears to be accessed through Amplitude's web interface, where users can:

1. Select a critical event to track
2. Choose a usage interval for analysis
3. Switch between Growth, Dormant, and Pulse views
4. Apply segmentation to analyze specific user groups
5. Export or share the resulting visualizations and data

The tool is designed to help product teams answer questions about user engagement patterns, retention issues, and the effectiveness of product changes or marketing campaigns in driving sustainable user growth.
