# Summary
The Lifecycle chart in Amplitude helps analyze user activity patterns through three views: Growth (default), Dormant, and Pulse. It categorizes active users as new, current, or resurrected, and tracks dormant users, allowing teams to understand user retention and growth metrics across daily, weekly, or monthly intervals.
