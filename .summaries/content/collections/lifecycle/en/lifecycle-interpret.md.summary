# Summary
The Lifecycle chart in Amplitude helps analyze user activity patterns through three views: Growth (default), Dormant, and Pulse. The Growth view categorizes active users as new, current, or resurrected, while tracking dormant users, allowing teams to understand which user segments most impact their active user metrics.
