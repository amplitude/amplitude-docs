# Amplitude Lifecycle Chart

Amplitude's Lifecycle chart is a comprehensive user growth tracking and retention analysis tool available exclusively on Growth and Enterprise plans. This feature provides deep insights into user base evolution by categorizing users into distinct behavioral segments and visualizing their engagement patterns over time.

## Core Product Features and Functionality

The Lifecycle chart operates as a sophisticated user segmentation and growth analysis system that tracks how users interact with critical events within defined usage intervals. The primary functionality centers around categorizing users into four distinct behavioral buckets:

- **New Users**: First-time users performing the tracked event
- **Current Users**: Users who performed the event in both current and previous periods  
- **Resurrected Users**: Previously dormant users who have returned to perform the event
- **Dormant Users**: Users who performed the event in previous periods but not in the current period

The system offers three distinct visualization modes: Growth histogram view (the primary interface), Dormant chart view, and Pulse chart view, each providing different analytical perspectives on user lifecycle patterns.

## Product Architecture and Module Integration

The Lifecycle chart integrates across three core Amplitude modules, creating a unified analysis framework:

**Events Module** serves as the foundation by defining the starting event or critical action that determines user engagement. This module establishes the behavioral trigger that categorizes users into lifecycle segments.

**Segmentation Module** enables targeted analysis by allowing users to focus on specific user cohorts or demographic segments, providing granular control over which user populations are included in the lifecycle analysis.

**Metrics Module** controls the temporal framework through usage interval configuration, supporting daily, weekly, and monthly analysis periods that determine how user behavior is measured and categorized across time periods.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Active User Segments** represent engaged users and are visualized in blue buckets within the Growth histogram view, encompassing new, current, and resurrected user categories.

**Dormant Users** represent disengaged users shown in red buckets, indicating users who have stopped performing the tracked critical event.

**Usage Intervals** define the temporal measurement framework (daily, weekly, monthly) that determines how user behavior is categorized across time periods.

**Pulse Ratio** represents a key growth metric calculated as: (new users + resurrected users) / dormant users, providing a quantitative measure of user base health and growth momentum.

**Growth Histogram View** serves as the primary visualization interface, displaying the distribution of users across lifecycle segments over time.

**Breakdown Table** provides detailed data export functionality, allowing users to extract lifecycle analysis data in CSV format for further analysis.

## Ecosystem Integration and Analytical Framework

The Lifecycle chart functions as a critical component within Amplitude's broader retention and engagement analysis ecosystem. It operates within the retention lifecycle framework, providing foundational insights that complement other Amplitude analytics tools. The system's integration with Events, Segmentation, and Metrics modules demonstrates its role as a central analytical hub that leverages Amplitude's core data infrastructure.

The tool's export capabilities through CSV functionality enable integration with external business intelligence systems and reporting workflows, extending its utility beyond Amplitude's native interface.

## Analytical Methodologies and Use Cases

The Lifecycle chart supports multiple analytical approaches through its three visualization modes. The Growth histogram view provides comprehensive user distribution analysis, while the Dormant chart view focuses specifically on user churn patterns. The Pulse chart view emphasizes growth momentum through ratio-based calculations.

Primary use cases include user base growth tracking, retention analysis, engagement pattern identification, and churn prediction. The system enables businesses to understand user lifecycle progression, identify critical engagement periods, and measure the effectiveness of retention strategies.

The combination of visual analysis tools and quantitative metrics like the Pulse ratio provides both immediate insights and deeper analytical capabilities for understanding user behavior patterns and predicting future growth trends.
