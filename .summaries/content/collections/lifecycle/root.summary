Amplitude Lifecycle Analytics is a comprehensive user growth and retention analytics feature that categorizes users into distinct behavioral segments to provide deep insights into user base evolution. The platform enables product teams to track engagement patterns, measure growth effectiveness, and understand retention dynamics through sophisticated segmentation and visualization capabilities.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

Lifecycle operates as an integrated component within Amplitude's analytics platform through three interconnected modules:

**Events Module Integration** serves as the foundational layer, defining critical events that determine user activity status. Users configure starting events that trigger lifecycle tracking, establishing behavioral baselines for user categorization.

**Segmentation Module Integration** enables targeted analysis by applying specific user segments to lifecycle tracking. This provides granular control over user populations included in analysis, supporting cohort-based and demographic-specific insights.

**Metrics Module Integration** controls temporal analysis parameters through configurable usage intervals (daily, weekly, monthly), determining time windows for user activity assessment and lifecycle state transitions.

The feature functions both as a standalone analytical tool and as a complementary component to Amplitude's retention and engagement analytics suite, offering multiple visualization modes for different analytical perspectives.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**User Lifecycle States:**
- **New Users**: First-time users performing tracked events within specified intervals
- **Current Users**: Previously active users maintaining engagement in current periods
- **Resurrected Users**: Previously dormant users returning to activity after inactivity periods
- **Dormant Users**: Previously active users who have ceased engagement with tracked events

**Chart Visualization Modes:**
- **Growth View**: Primary histogram visualization displaying active user segments with dormant user overlay
- **Dormant View**: Focused analysis of user churn and dormancy patterns
- **Pulse View**: Ratio-based visualization showing relationships between active and total user populations

**Analytical Components:**
- **Usage Intervals**: Configurable time periods defining activity measurement windows
- **Critical Events**: User-defined actions determining active vs. inactive user status
- **Pulse Ratio**: Calculated metric representing active users as percentage of total user base
- **Breakdown Table**: Exportable data view providing detailed numerical analysis of lifecycle segments

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Lifecycle analytics integrates into Amplitude's enterprise ecosystem as a Growth and Enterprise plan feature, positioning it as an advanced analytical capability for organizations requiring sophisticated user behavior analysis. The feature connects with Amplitude's broader retention framework, complementing funnel analysis, cohort studies, and user journey mapping.

Data export functionality through breakdown tables enables integration with external business intelligence systems and custom reporting workflows, facilitating cross-platform analysis and supporting organizations using Amplitude within larger analytics technology stacks.

## Technical Implementation

The feature operates through Amplitude's standard chart interface with specialized configuration options following a structured workflow:

1. Event selection in Events Module for activity definition
2. User segment application in Segmentation Module for population targeting  
3. Usage interval specification in Metrics Module for temporal analysis
4. Chart view selection for visualization preference

The system processes user activity data against defined events and intervals, automatically categorizing users into lifecycle states based on engagement patterns and historical activity records. Users can switch between Growth, Dormant, and Pulse chart views within the same analysis, providing multiple analytical perspectives on identical datasets without requiring reconfiguration of underlying parameters.
