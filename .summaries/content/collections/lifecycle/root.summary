# Amplitude Lifecycle Analysis

## Product Overview

Amplitude Lifecycle Analysis is a specialized analytics tool designed to help product teams track and understand user engagement patterns over time. It provides a visual framework for analyzing user base growth, retention metrics, and activity patterns by categorizing users into distinct segments based on their interaction status with a product. This tool enables teams to identify trends in user behavior, measure product stickiness, and make data-driven decisions to improve user retention.

## Key Features and Concepts

Lifecycle Analysis offers three primary analytical views:

- **Growth View**: The default visualization that focuses on active users, categorizing them as new, current, or resurrected
- **Dormant View**: Tracks users who have become inactive, helping identify churn patterns
- **Pulse View**: Measures the health of user engagement by calculating the ratio of returning users (current + resurrected) to churned users (dormant)

The core of Lifecycle Analysis is its user categorization system:

- **New Users**: First-time performers of the tracked event within the current interval
- **Current Users**: Users who performed the event in both the current and previous intervals
- **Resurrected Users**: Users who performed the event in the current interval after a period of inactivity
- **Dormant Users**: Users who performed the event in the previous interval but not in the current one

## Product Relationships and Features

Lifecycle Analysis is part of Amplitude's analytics suite, available specifically to Growth and Enterprise plan customers. It integrates with Amplitude's event tracking system to provide specialized retention and growth analysis. The tool allows teams to:

1. Define critical events that represent meaningful user engagement
2. Apply user properties and event properties for detailed segmentation
3. Customize analysis intervals (daily, weekly, or monthly) to match product usage patterns
4. Visualize user activity through multiple views with supporting data tables
5. Generate histogram visualizations to understand activity distribution patterns

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Critical Event**: The specific user action being tracked to determine activity status (e.g., app open, purchase, content creation)
- **Usage Interval**: The time period for analysis (daily, weekly, or monthly)
- **Growth Chart**: The default view showing active user segments (new, current, resurrected)
- **Dormant Chart**: View focusing on users who have stopped activity
- **Pulse Ratio**: Metric comparing returning users (current + resurrected) to churned users (dormant)
- **Histogram Visualization**: Chart type used to display user activity patterns across segments
- **Breakdown Table**: Detailed data view showing metrics by segment with exact counts and percentages

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Lifecycle Analysis is an analytical component within Amplitude's broader product analytics platform. It:

1. Relies on Amplitude's event tracking infrastructure to collect and process user activity data
2. Complements other retention and engagement analysis tools in the platform
3. Supports product teams in understanding user behavior patterns over time
4. Helps identify retention issues and growth opportunities through visual analysis

The feature serves as a specialized visualization and analytical approach built on Amplitude's core event tracking capabilities. It's particularly valuable for teams focused on user retention, engagement patterns, and growth metrics.

Lifecycle Analysis is accessed through the Amplitude web interface rather than through API endpoints or command-line tools. Users configure the analysis by selecting critical events, choosing appropriate time intervals, and applying relevant segmentation properties to gain insights into user engagement patterns.
