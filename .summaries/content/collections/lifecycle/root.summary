# Amplitude Lifecycle Analysis

## Product Overview

Amplitude Lifecycle Analysis is a powerful analytics tool that helps product teams understand user engagement patterns and track user base growth over time. It categorizes users into distinct segments based on their activity patterns, providing insights into retention, churn, and reactivation metrics. This feature enables teams to answer critical questions about user behavior across different time intervals and identify opportunities to improve user engagement and retention.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Lifecycle Views
- **Growth View**: The default view that shows active users categorized as new, current, or resurrected, while also tracking dormant users
- **Dormant View**: Focuses specifically on users who have become inactive, helping identify churn patterns
- **Pulse View**: Provides a ratio of users entering versus exiting the active user base, offering a quick health metric

### User Categorization
- **New Users**: Users who performed the tracked event for the first time in the current interval
- **Current Users**: Users who performed the event in both the current and previous intervals
- **Resurrected Users**: Users who performed the event in the current interval but not in the previous one (and are not new)
- **Dormant Users**: Users who performed the event in the previous interval but not in the current one

### Analysis Capabilities
- **Customizable Time Intervals**: Analyze user behavior across daily, weekly, or monthly periods
- **Critical Event Tracking**: Focus analysis on specific important events that define active usage
- **Histogram Visualization**: Visual representation of user activity patterns
- **Breakdown Table**: Detailed data view showing user segments and metrics
- **Segmentation**: Ability to analyze specific user cohorts based on properties and behaviors

## Product Relationships and Ecosystem

Lifecycle Analysis is part of Amplitude's broader analytics platform, available to users on Growth and Enterprise plans. It integrates with Amplitude's core event tracking infrastructure and complements other analytics features:

1. It builds upon Amplitude's event tracking system to categorize users based on their engagement patterns
2. It works alongside other retention analysis tools to provide a different perspective on user behavior
3. It can be used in conjunction with segmentation features to understand how different user cohorts move through lifecycle stages
4. The insights gained can inform product decisions, marketing campaigns, and retention strategies

The feature serves as a critical component in Amplitude's suite of user behavior analysis tools, helping teams understand not just what users are doing, but how their engagement patterns evolve over time.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Critical Event**: The specific user action being tracked to determine active status (e.g., app open, purchase, content view)
- **Usage Interval**: The time period for analysis (daily, weekly, monthly)
- **Pulse Ratio**: A formula measuring the ratio of users entering vs. exiting the active user base, calculated as (New + Resurrected) ÷ Dormant
- **Growth Chart**: The default visualization showing the breakdown of active users by category
- **Dormant Users**: Previously active users who have not performed the critical event in the current period
- **Event Properties**: Attributes associated with events that can be used for more granular analysis
- **Active Users**: The sum of new, current, and resurrected users in a given time period

## Technical Implementation

The Lifecycle Analysis feature is accessed through Amplitude's analytics dashboard interface. Users can:

1. Navigate to the Lifecycle chart in the Amplitude dashboard
2. Configure the critical event that defines active usage
3. Set the appropriate time interval for analysis (daily, weekly, monthly)
4. Apply segmentation filters to focus on specific user cohorts
5. Switch between Growth, Dormant, and Pulse views
6. Export the resulting analysis as CSV or share it with team members

While specific API endpoints aren't explicitly mentioned in the documentation, the feature leverages Amplitude's event tracking infrastructure to process and categorize user activity data according to the defined parameters.
