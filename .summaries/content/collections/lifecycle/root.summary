## Amplitude Lifecycle Chart

Amplitude's Lifecycle chart is a comprehensive user growth analysis tool available exclusively on Growth and Enterprise plans that provides deep insights into user base evolution by categorizing users into distinct behavioral segments over configurable time intervals.

## Core Product Features

The Lifecycle chart analyzes user engagement patterns by segmenting active users into four primary categories:
- **New users**: First-time users performing the tracked event
- **Current users**: Users who performed the event in both current and previous intervals
- **Resurrected users**: Previously dormant users who have returned to activity
- **Dormant users**: Previously active users who haven't performed the event in the current interval

The analysis can be configured around any instrumented event or critical events, with flexible usage intervals (daily, weekly, monthly) to match business requirements.

## Product Architecture and Module Integration

The Lifecycle chart integrates seamlessly with Amplitude's core module ecosystem:

- **Events Module**: Defines the starting event for lifecycle analysis, which can be any instrumented event or critical business events
- **Segmentation Module**: Enables user segment filtering to focus analysis on specific user cohorts
- **Metrics Module**: Configures usage intervals (daily, weekly, monthly) that determine the temporal framework for user categorization

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Usage Intervals**: Configurable time periods (daily, weekly, monthly) that define the temporal boundaries for user activity analysis

**Growth Histogram View**: The primary visualization displaying active user segments as stacked bars with dormant users shown separately, providing a comprehensive view of user base composition over time

**Dormant Chart View**: Alternative visualization focusing specifically on users who have become inactive, tracking the flow from active to dormant states

**Pulse Chart View**: Specialized view that calculates engagement ratios using the formula: (New + Current + Resurrected Users) / (New + Current + Resurrected + Dormant Users), providing a normalized engagement metric

**Breakdown Table**: Exportable data table containing detailed user counts and percentages for each lifecycle segment

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The Lifecycle chart functions as a critical component within Amplitude's retention and engagement analytics suite, complementing user journey analysis and cohort tracking capabilities. It provides foundational insights that inform user acquisition strategies, retention optimization, and churn prevention initiatives.

The tool's integration with Amplitude's segmentation capabilities allows for sophisticated user base analysis, enabling product teams to understand growth patterns across different user segments and optimize engagement strategies accordingly.

## Chart Interpretation and Analysis

The product offers multiple visualization perspectives through switchable chart views, each optimized for different analytical needs. The Growth view emphasizes overall user base composition, while the Dormant view highlights churn patterns, and the Pulse view provides normalized engagement metrics for comparative analysis across different time periods or user segments.
