# Amplitude Lifecycle Chart

## Overview
The Lifecycle chart is an advanced analytics feature in Amplitude that visualizes user activity patterns over time. It categorizes users into distinct segments based on their engagement status, enabling product teams to track user engagement, retention, and growth. This feature is exclusively available to customers on Amplitude's Growth and Enterprise plans.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Visualization Views
The Lifecycle chart offers three specialized views for analyzing user behavior:

1. **Growth View (Default)** - Focuses on active users, categorizing them into new, current, and resurrected segments to track user base growth.
2. **Dormant View** - Highlights users who have become inactive, helping identify churn patterns.
3. **Pulse View** - Provides a ratio of active users to dormant users, offering a quick health metric of user engagement.

### User Segmentation Categories
Users are automatically classified into four distinct categories:

- **New Users** - Users who performed the selected event for the first time during the current interval.
- **Current Users** - Users who were active both in the current interval and the previous interval.
- **Resurrected Users** - Users who were active in the current interval after being inactive for at least one previous interval.
- **Dormant Users** - Users who were active in the previous interval but not in the current interval.

### Time Interval Options
The chart supports multiple time granularities:
- Daily
- Weekly
- Monthly

These intervals determine how user activity is grouped and analyzed, allowing teams to examine patterns at different time scales.

### Analysis Capabilities
- **Critical Event Tracking** - Select specific events to analyze user engagement around key actions
- **Event Property Filtering** - Apply filters based on specific properties for granular analysis
- **Retention Analysis** - Identify patterns of user churn and re-engagement
- **Activity Distribution** - Visualize user activity through histograms
- **Breakdown Table Export** - Export detailed data for further analysis in other tools

## Key Metrics and Formulas

### Pulse Ratio
The Pulse ratio is calculated as: 
```
(New + Current + Resurrected Users) ÷ Dormant Users
```
This ratio serves as a health metric for user engagement, with higher values indicating stronger growth and retention.

## Product Ecosystem Integration
The Lifecycle chart is a component of Amplitude's broader analytics suite, complementing other retention and engagement analysis tools. It provides visual representations of user activity patterns that help teams understand how users interact with their product over time.

The chart data can be exported for deeper analysis or integration with other business intelligence tools, allowing teams to incorporate lifecycle insights into broader analytics workflows.

## Use Cases
- Tracking overall user base growth trends
- Identifying retention issues and churn patterns
- Analyzing engagement patterns around critical product events
- Understanding seasonal or cyclical user behavior
- Measuring the impact of product changes on user activity
- Comparing engagement across different user segments
- Monitoring the health of user acquisition and retention efforts

## Nomenclature and Definitions
- **Interval**: The time period used for analysis (daily, weekly, monthly)
- **Active Users**: Combined total of new, current, and resurrected users
- **Churn**: The process of users becoming dormant
- **Resurrection**: The process of dormant users becoming active again
- **Pulse Ratio**: The health metric comparing active users to dormant users
