## Amplitude Instrumentation SDK Ecosystem

Amplitude provides a comprehensive instrumentation platform centered around Analytics and Experiment SDKs that enable event tracking, user analytics, and feature experimentation across multiple platforms. The ecosystem supports both client-side and server-side implementations with sophisticated tooling for type-safe analytics instrumentation.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

The instrumentation ecosystem consists of three primary product categories:

**Analytics SDKs** form the core tracking infrastructure, available for 12+ platforms including Browser (JavaScript/TypeScript), Node.js, Android (Kotlin/Java), iOS (Swift/Objective-C), JRE, Python, React Native, Flutter, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine. These SDKs utilize different API endpoints based on implementation type:
- Client-side SDKs (Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Unity, Flutter) use the HTTP V2 API
- Server-side SDKs (Node.js, Go, Python, Java) use the Batch event upload API
- Experiment SDKs leverage the Evaluation API for feature flag functionality

**Ampli** serves as a code generation tool that creates type-safe wrappers around Amplitude SDKs based on tracking plans defined in Amplitude Data. The Ampli CLI provides commands like `ampli pull` for generating wrappers and `ampli status` for verifying event instrumentation, ensuring schema compliance and reducing implementation errors.

**SDK Extensions** include middleware (for maintenance SDKs) and plugins (for latest SDK versions) that enable custom event processing through enrichment, transformation, filtering, and third-party routing capabilities.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Tracking Plans**: Schema definitions in Amplitude Data that specify event structures and properties, used by Ampli for code generation

**Dynamic Configuration**: Automatic server URL selection based on user location via the `useDynamicConfig` flag, optimizing data ingestion routing

**SDK Lifecycle Phases**: Four-stage support model including Developer Preview/Beta, General Availability (GA), Maintenance, and End-of-Support phases with X.Y.Z versioning

**Event Processing Components**:
- `ampli.load()`: Initializes the Ampli wrapper with configuration
- `ampli.track()`: Sends events through type-safe interfaces
- `init()`: SDK initialization with API key and configuration
- `track()`: Core event tracking method
- `identify()`: User property management

**Middleware vs Plugins**: Middleware (maintenance SDKs) uses `addEventMiddleware` with `MiddlewarePayload` and `MiddlewareNext`, while Plugins (latest SDKs) implement `setup()` and `execute()` methods with `PluginType.ENRICHMENT` or `PluginType.DESTINATION`

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The instrumentation platform integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem through:

**Data Residency**: EU data residency support via `serverZone` configuration for compliance requirements

**Third-party Integrations**: Destination plugins enable routing to Segment, Hotjar, Google Analytics, FullStory, and other analytics platforms

**Development Workflow**: Integration with package managers (npm, yarn, pip, gradle, maven, CocoaPods) and development environments across web, mobile, and gaming platforms

**Quality Assurance**: Built-in debugging capabilities addressing common issues like API key validation, `flushQueueSize` configuration, Client Event Time discrepancies, and device family parsing

## API Endpoints and CLI Commands

**Ampli CLI Commands**:
- `ampli pull`: Generate type-safe SDK wrappers from tracking plans
- `ampli status`: Verify event instrumentation implementation status

**Core SDK Methods**:
- `amplitude.init(API_KEY, options)`: Initialize SDK with configuration
- `amplitude.track(eventType, eventProperties)`: Send tracking events
- `amplitude.identify(identifyEvent)`: Update user properties
- `amplitude.add(plugin)`: Register plugins for event processing
- `amplitude.flush()`: Force immediate event transmission

**Configuration APIs**:
- `setServerUrl()`: Manual server endpoint configuration
- `useDynamicConfig`: Enable automatic server selection
- `flushQueueSize` and `flushIntervalMillis`: Control batching behavior

The platform supports hybrid instrumentation approaches, allowing organizations to combine client-side, server-side, and third-party source implementations based on specific use cases and technical requirements.
