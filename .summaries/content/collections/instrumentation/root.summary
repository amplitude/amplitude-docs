# Amplitude Instrumentation SDK Platform

Amplitude provides a comprehensive instrumentation platform for analytics and experimentation through multiple SDKs, tools, and APIs that enable event tracking, user behavior analysis, and feature experimentation across web, mobile, and server environments.

## Product Architecture and Components

### Core SDK Categories

**Analytics SDKs** form the primary instrumentation layer, available across 11+ platforms including Browser (JavaScript/TypeScript), Node.js, Android (Kotlin/Java), iOS (Swift/Objective-C), JRE, Python, React Native, Flutter, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine. These SDKs handle event collection, user identification, and data transmission to Amplitude's analytics platform.

**Experiment SDKs** provide feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities, working alongside analytics SDKs to enable controlled feature rollouts and experimentation workflows.

**Client-side vs Server-side Architecture** offers flexible deployment options:
- Client-side SDKs (Browser, Android, iOS, Unity, React Native) for direct user interaction tracking
- Server-side SDKs (Node.js, Go, Python, Java) for backend event processing
- Hybrid approaches combining both methodologies
- Third-party integrations for existing data pipelines

### API Endpoints and Integration Points

The platform exposes several key APIs:
- **HTTP V2 API** for direct event ingestion
- **Batch Event Upload API** for high-volume server-side implementations  
- **Evaluation API** for experiment feature flag evaluation

Dynamic configuration automatically selects optimal server URLs based on user location, with specific support for regions including Mainland China through the `useDynamicConfig` flag.

## Key Tools and Development Features

### Ampli Code Generation

Ampli serves as a sophisticated code generation tool that creates type-safe wrappers around Amplitude SDKs based on tracking plans defined in Amplitude Data. Key capabilities include:
- Compile-time validation and TypeScript autocompletion
- CLI commands (`ampli pull`, `ampli status`, `ampli configure`) for workflow management
- Source code scanning and instrumentation verification
- Generated methods like `ampli.load()` and `ampli.songPlayed()` for type-safe event tracking

### SDK Extensions and Customization

**Plugins Architecture** (latest SDKs) provides extensibility through:
- **Enrichment Plugins** for event modification, filtering, and PII removal via `PluginType.ENRICHMENT`
- **Destination Plugins** for routing to third-party services (Segment, Hotjar, Google Analytics, FullStory) via `PluginType.DESTINATION`
- Plugin lifecycle methods `setup()` and `execute()` for custom behavior implementation

**SDK Middleware** (maintenance SDKs) offers similar functionality through `addEventMiddleware()` for event transformation and routing, though this has been superseded by the plugins system.

## Core Nomenclature and Concepts

### Event and User Management
- **event_type** and **event_properties** for categorizing and enriching events
- **user_id** and **device_id** for user identification and device tracking
- **user_properties** for user attribute management with identify() calls
- **Client Event Time** vs **Client Upload Time** vs **server_upload_time** for timestamp handling

### Configuration and Performance
- **flushQueueSize** and **flushIntervalMillis** for batch processing optimization
- **API key validation** for project authentication
- **ServerZone.EU** for European data residency compliance
- **useDynamicConfig** for automatic server selection

### SDK Lifecycle and Versioning
- **X.Y.Z semantic versioning** across all SDK packages
- **Four-phase lifecycle**: Developer Preview/Beta → General Availability (GA) → Maintenance → End-of-Support (EOL)
- **Version support matrix** tracking SDK lifecycle phases and transition dates

## Debugging and Troubleshooting

The platform includes comprehensive debugging capabilities addressing:
- Event delivery validation and API key verification
- Privacy settings impact on IP address collection
- Device family parsing using ua-parser-js library
- Race condition handling in user_properties updates
- Client/server timestamp synchronization issues
- Navigator.userAgent parsing for device identification

## Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's instrumentation platform integrates with the broader product ecosystem through:
- **Amplitude Data** for tracking plan management and schema validation
- **Third-party routing** to analytics platforms like Segment and Google Analytics
- **Package manager distribution** via npm, yarn, CocoaPods, and platform-specific repositories
- **GitHub repository management** with archiving policies for end-of-life SDKs
- **Operating system and runtime dependency management** across supported platforms

The platform supports both real-time and batch processing workflows, with automatic failover and regional optimization ensuring reliable data collection across global deployments.
