# Amplitude Instrumentation Platform

Amplitude's instrumentation platform is a comprehensive analytics and experimentation ecosystem designed for cross-platform event tracking, feature flagging, and A/B testing. The platform serves as the foundational layer for product analytics, enabling organizations to collect, validate, and route behavioral data across web, mobile, server, and gaming environments.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The instrumentation platform operates through a three-tier architecture that separates data collection, validation, and experimentation concerns:

**Analytics SDK Layer** forms the foundation with 11+ platform-specific SDKs (Browser, Node.js, Android Kotlin/Java, iOS Swift, JRE, Python, React Native, Flutter, Go, Unity, Unreal Engine). These SDKs handle core event lifecycle management including collection, batching, local storage, and transmission to Amplitude's ingestion infrastructure. The SDKs are categorized into client-side implementations (running on user devices) and server-side implementations (supporting multi-user server environments).

**Ampli Code Generation Layer** sits above the Analytics SDKs, providing type-safe instrumentation through auto-generated wrappers. Ampli connects to tracking plans defined in Amplitude Data, generating platform-specific code that enforces event schemas at compile-time and provides IntelliSense support for developers.

**Experiment SDK Layer** operates alongside Analytics SDKs to deliver feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities. These SDKs evaluate feature flags through the Evaluation API and automatically track experiment exposures back through the Analytics layer.

**Extension System** enables customization through middleware (Maintenance SDKs) and plugins (newer SDKs). Extensions support event enrichment, filtering, validation, and routing to third-party destinations like Segment, Hotjar, Google Analytics, and FullStory.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**SDK Lifecycle Management** follows a structured progression:
- **Developer Preview/Beta**: Early access versions for testing new features
- **General Availability (GA)**: Production-ready releases with full support
- **Maintenance**: Legacy versions receiving only critical security and bug fixes
- **End-of-Support (EOL)**: Deprecated versions no longer supported

**Client-side vs Server-side Architecture**: Client-side SDKs (Browser, mobile, gaming) execute on user devices and handle single-user contexts, while server-side SDKs (Node.js, Go, Python, Java) run in server environments and support multi-user scenarios with user context switching.

**Event Processing Extensions**:
- **Middleware**: Legacy extension system for Maintenance SDKs
- **Plugins**: Modern extension architecture with `setup()` and `execute()` lifecycle methods
- **Destination Plugins**: Route events to third-party services
- **Enrichment Plugins**: Add computed properties or external data to events

**Dynamic Configuration**: Automatic server endpoint selection based on user geography using the `useDynamicConfig` flag, optimizing data routing and compliance with regional data residency requirements.

## Core APIs and Command Interfaces

**Analytics SDK Core Methods**:
- `amplitude.init(apiKey, config)` - Initialize SDK with project credentials and configuration
- `amplitude.track(eventType, eventProperties)` - Send behavioral events with custom properties
- `amplitude.identify(identifyEvent)` - Set or update user properties
- `amplitude.flush()` - Force immediate transmission of queued events
- `amplitude.setUserId(userId)` - Associate events with specific user identities

**Ampli CLI Commands**:
- `ampli pull` - Generate type-safe event wrappers from Amplitude Data tracking plans
- `ampli status` - Validate current instrumentation against defined tracking plan
- `ampli.load()` - Initialize the generated type-safe wrapper
- `ampli.[eventName]()` - Type-safe event tracking methods (e.g., `ampli.songPlayed()`)

**HTTP API Endpoints**:
- **HTTP V2 API** - Direct event ingestion endpoint for custom implementations
- **Batch Upload API** - Bulk event submission for high-volume server-side tracking
- **Evaluation API** - Feature flag evaluation for Experiment SDKs

**Configuration Parameters**:
- `flushQueueSize` - Number of events to batch before transmission
- `flushIntervalMillis` - Maximum time between batch transmissions
- `ServerZone.EU` - Route data to EU servers for GDPR compliance
- `useDynamicConfig` - Enable automatic server selection based on user location

## Ecosystem Integration and Broader Platform Context

The instrumentation platform serves as the data collection foundation for Amplitude's broader product ecosystem, feeding into Analytics for behavioral analysis, Experiment for feature flag management, and Data for governance and schema management.

**Package Distribution** follows platform-native conventions through npm (JavaScript), CocoaPods/Swift Package Manager (iOS), Maven/Gradle (Android/Java), PyPI (Python), and Unity Package Manager (Unity), ensuring seamless integration into existing development workflows.

**Third-party Integration Strategy** positions Amplitude as the primary analytics backbone while enabling data routing to complementary tools. Destination plugins support customer data platforms (Segment), session replay tools (Hotjar), web analytics (Google Analytics), and marketing automation platforms.

**Enterprise Compatibility** maintains backward compatibility through structured maintenance policies with 6-month dependency support windows and 12-month maintenance phases. This approach balances innovation velocity with enterprise stability requirements.

**Debugging and Operational Support** includes comprehensive troubleshooting guidance covering API key validation, event timing synchronization, device identification conflicts, user property race conditions, and privacy-compliant IP address handling.

The platform's architecture enables organizations to implement a unified instrumentation strategy across all digital touchpoints while maintaining flexibility for platform-specific optimizations and third-party integrations.
