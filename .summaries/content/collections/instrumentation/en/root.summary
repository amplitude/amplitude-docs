## Amplitude Instrumentation Platform

Amplitude provides a comprehensive instrumentation platform for analytics and experimentation across multiple platforms and environments. The platform consists of Analytics SDKs for event tracking, Experiment SDKs for feature flagging and A/B testing, and supporting tools like Ampli for type-safe code generation.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

The instrumentation platform operates on a multi-layered architecture:

**Core Analytics SDKs** support 11+ platforms including Browser, Node.js, Android (Kotlin/Java), iOS (Swift), JRE, Python, React Native, Flutter, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine. These SDKs handle event collection, batching, and transmission to Amplitude's ingestion endpoints.

**Ampli Code Generation Tool** sits above the Analytics SDKs, generating type-safe wrappers based on tracking plans defined in Amplitude Data. Ampli creates platform-specific code that provides compile-time validation and IntelliSense support for event tracking.

**SDK Extensions** include middleware (for Maintenance SDKs) and plugins (for newer SDKs) that enable custom event processing, enrichment, filtering, and routing to third-party services like Segment, Hotjar, Google Analytics, and FullStory.

**Experiment SDKs** provide feature flag evaluation and A/B testing capabilities, working alongside Analytics SDKs to track experiment exposures and outcomes.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Client-side vs Server-side SDKs**: Client-side SDKs (Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Unity, Flutter, Unreal) run on user devices, while server-side SDKs (Node.js, Go, Python, Java) run on servers and support multi-user environments.

**SDK Lifecycle Phases**: 
- Developer Preview/Beta: Early access versions
- General Availability (GA): Production-ready releases
- Maintenance: Legacy versions receiving critical updates only
- End-of-Support (EOL): No longer supported

**Middleware vs Plugins**: Middleware (Maintenance SDKs) and Plugins (newer SDKs) both enable event processing extensions, with plugins offering setup() and execute() methods for enrichment and destination routing.

**Dynamic Configuration**: Automatic server URL selection based on user location using the `useDynamicConfig` flag, optimizing data routing globally.

## Core APIs and Endpoints

**Analytics SDK Methods**:
- `amplitude.init()` - Initialize SDK with API key and configuration
- `amplitude.track()` - Send events with properties
- `amplitude.identify()` - Set user properties
- `amplitude.flush()` - Force immediate event transmission

**Ampli CLI Commands**:
- `ampli pull` - Generate type-safe wrappers from tracking plans
- `ampli status` - Verify event instrumentation against tracking plan
- `ampli.load()` - Initialize generated wrapper
- `ampli.songPlayed()` - Example type-safe event method

**HTTP Endpoints**:
- HTTP V2 API - Direct event ingestion
- Batch event upload - Bulk event submission
- Evaluation API - Feature flag evaluation

**Configuration Options**:
- `flushQueueSize` - Events per batch
- `flushIntervalMillis` - Batch transmission interval
- `ServerZone.EU` - EU data residency
- `useDynamicConfig` - Enable automatic server selection

## Integration Patterns

**Package Manager Installation**: SDKs distribute via platform-native package managers (npm, CocoaPods, Maven, PyPI, Unity Package Manager).

**Third-party Integrations**: Destination plugins and middleware enable routing to analytics platforms, customer data platforms, and marketing tools while maintaining Amplitude as the primary analytics backbone.

**Debugging and Troubleshooting**: Comprehensive debugging covers API key validation, event timing discrepancies, device identification, user property race conditions, and privacy-related IP address handling.

The platform maintains backward compatibility through a structured maintenance policy with 6-month dependency support windows and 12-month maintenance phases, ensuring enterprise-grade stability while enabling continuous innovation.
