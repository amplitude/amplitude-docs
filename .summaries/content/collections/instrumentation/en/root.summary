# Amplitude Instrumentation Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude is an analytics platform that provides tools for tracking, analyzing, and optimizing user behavior across digital products. The instrumentation component of Amplitude consists of various SDKs (Software Development Kits) that enable developers to implement analytics tracking in their applications across multiple platforms.

Key features of Amplitude's instrumentation offerings include:

1. **Cross-platform SDK support** - SDKs for web, mobile, server-side, and game development platforms
2. **Type-safe event tracking** - Through the Ampli wrapper tool
3. **Flexible configuration options** - Including dynamic server selection and middleware/plugins
4. **Experiment capabilities** - For A/B testing and feature flagging
5. **Debugging and troubleshooting tools** - For ensuring data quality

The primary use cases include:
- Tracking user interactions and behaviors in digital products
- Implementing A/B tests and feature experiments
- Ensuring data quality through type-safe implementations
- Routing analytics data to multiple destinations

## Product Relationships and Features

The Amplitude instrumentation ecosystem consists of several interconnected components:

1. **Analytics SDKs** - The core SDKs for different platforms that handle event tracking, user identification, and data transmission to Amplitude servers.

2. **Ampli Wrapper** - A code generation tool that creates type-safe wrappers around Amplitude SDKs based on tracking plans defined in Amplitude Data.

3. **Experiment SDKs** - Specialized SDKs for implementing A/B tests and feature flags.

4. **SDK Extensions**:
   - **Middleware** (legacy) - Custom code that runs on every event for enrichment, transformation, filtering, or routing.
   - **Plugins** (current) - The modern replacement for middleware, offering similar functionality with improved architecture.

5. **Dynamic Configuration** - A feature that automatically selects optimal server endpoints based on user location.

The Analytics SDKs are available for multiple platforms and are categorized as either client-side (running on user devices) or server-side (running on backend servers). Developers can choose the appropriate SDK based on their specific needs or implement a hybrid approach using both types.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Client-side Sources** - Code running on user devices (mobile apps, web browsers) that directly captures user interactions.

2. **Server-side Sources** - Code running on servers that can send events to Amplitude, often used for sensitive operations or backend events.

3. **SDK Lifecycle Phases**:
   - **Developer Preview** - Early access, not recommended for production
   - **General Availability (GA)** - Stable release suitable for production
   - **Maintenance** - No new features, only critical bug fixes
   - **End-of-Support (EOS)** - No longer maintained or supported

4. **MiddlewarePayload** - The data structure passed through middleware functions containing event data that can be modified.

5. **Plugin Types**:
   - **Enrichment Plugins** - Modify event properties or filter events
   - **Destination Plugins** - Route events to third-party services

6. **Dynamic Configuration** - Feature that automatically selects the optimal server URL based on user location.

7. **Ampli Wrapper** - Generated code that provides type-safe interfaces for tracking events according to a predefined tracking plan.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's instrumentation tools integrate with the broader Amplitude product ecosystem in several ways:

1. **Amplitude Data** - The Analytics SDKs send event data to Amplitude Data for storage and analysis. Ampli uses tracking plans defined in Amplitude Data to generate type-safe wrappers.

2. **Amplitude Experiment** - The Experiment SDKs connect with Amplitude Experiment to implement A/B tests and feature flags, with results tracked through the Analytics SDKs.

3. **Third-party Integrations** - Through plugins/middleware, Amplitude can route data to other analytics and marketing platforms like Segment, Google Analytics, Hotjar, and FullStory.

4. **Data Residency Options** - The SDKs support different server endpoints for data residency requirements, including EU data residency.

## API Endpoints and Commands

### SDK Initialization Examples

**Browser JavaScript/TypeScript:**
```javascript
import * as amplitude from '@amplitude/analytics-browser';
amplitude.init('YOUR_API_KEY');
```

**iOS Swift:**
```swift
Amplitude.instance().initializeApiKey("YOUR_API_KEY")
```

**Android Kotlin:**
```kotlin
Amplitude.getInstance().initialize(context, "YOUR_API_KEY")
```

### Event Tracking Examples

**Basic Event:**
```javascript
amplitude.track('Button Clicked');
```

**Event with Properties:**
```javascript
amplitude.track('Purchase', { price: 10.99, item: 'Product Name' });
```

### User Identification:

```javascript
amplitude.identify(
  new amplitude.Identify().set('user_type', 'premium')
);
```

### Ampli CLI Commands:

```bash
# Install Ampli CLI
npm install -g @amplitude/ampli

# Pull tracking plan
ampli pull

# Generate SDK wrapper
ampli status
```

### HTTP API Endpoints:

- **HTTP V2 API** - Used for server-side event ingestion
- **Batch API** - For uploading multiple events in a single request

The SDKs automatically handle these API calls, but they can also be used directly for custom implementations.
