## Amplitude Instrumentation SDK Ecosystem

Amplitude provides a comprehensive instrumentation platform centered around Analytics and Experiment SDKs that enable event tracking, user analytics, and feature experimentation across multiple platforms. The ecosystem consists of client-side SDKs (Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Unity, Flutter, Unreal), server-side SDKs (Node.js, Go, Python, Java), and supporting tools for type-safe implementation and debugging.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

The instrumentation ecosystem operates on a multi-layered architecture:

**Core SDK Layer**: Analytics SDKs handle event tracking via HTTP V2 API and Batch event upload API, while Experiment SDKs manage feature flags through the Evaluation API. Both SDK types support dynamic configuration with the `useDynamicConfig` flag for automatic server URL selection based on user location.

**Code Generation Layer**: Ampli serves as the primary code generation tool, creating type-safe wrappers around Amplitude SDKs based on tracking plans defined in Amplitude Data. The Ampli CLI provides commands like `ampli pull` for generating wrappers and `ampli status` for verifying instrumentation completeness.

**Extension Layer**: SDK functionality extends through two mechanisms - Middleware (legacy maintenance SDKs) and Plugins (current SDK versions). Both enable event enrichment, transformation, filtering, and third-party routing through custom code execution.

**Integration Layer**: Destination plugins facilitate routing to third-party services including Segment, Hotjar, Google Analytics, and FullStory, while enrichment plugins handle event modification and PII removal.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Ampli**: Code generation tool that creates type-safe analytics wrappers with methods like `ampli.load()` and `ampli.track()` based on tracking plan schemas.

**Tracking Plan**: Schema definition in Amplitude Data that specifies event structure, properties, and validation rules for consistent instrumentation.

**SDK Middleware**: Legacy extension system using `MiddlewarePayload` and `MiddlewareNext` interfaces, accessible via `addEventMiddleware()` for event processing pipelines.

**SDK Plugins**: Current extension system with `setup()` and `execute()` methods, categorized as `PluginType.ENRICHMENT` for event modification or `PluginType.DESTINATION` for third-party routing.

**Dynamic Configuration**: Feature using `useDynamicConfig` flag for automatic server endpoint selection, particularly beneficial for Mainland China users requiring region-specific ingestion.

**Client Event Time vs Client Upload Time**: Timestamp differentiation where Client Event Time represents when events occurred versus when they were transmitted to Amplitude servers.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The instrumentation platform integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem through multiple touchpoints:

**Data Pipeline**: Events flow through HTTP V2 API and Batch event upload API to Amplitude's ingestion layer, with support for EU data residency via ServerZone configuration.

**Feature Management**: Experiment SDKs connect to Amplitude's experimentation platform, enabling A/B testing and feature flag management alongside analytics tracking.

**Data Governance**: Tracking plans in Amplitude Data provide schema enforcement and validation, ensuring data quality across instrumentation implementations.

**Third-Party Ecosystem**: Destination plugins enable data sharing with external platforms while maintaining Amplitude as the primary analytics source.

## API Endpoints and Command Line Tools

**Primary APIs**:
- HTTP V2 API: Real-time event ingestion for client-side SDKs
- Batch event upload API: Bulk event processing for server-side implementations  
- Evaluation API: Feature flag and experiment configuration retrieval

**Ampli CLI Commands**:
- `ampli pull`: Generate type-safe wrappers from tracking plans
- `ampli status`: Verify instrumentation coverage and implementation status

**Core SDK Methods**:
- `amplitude.init()`: SDK initialization with API key and configuration
- `amplitude.track()`: Event tracking with properties and user context
- `amplitude.add()`: Plugin registration for extended functionality
- `flush()`: Manual event transmission for debugging

## SDK Lifecycle and Maintenance

The platform follows a structured four-phase lifecycle: Developer Preview/Beta, General Availability (GA), Maintenance, and End-of-Support. Version management uses X.Y.Z semantic versioning across all SDKs, with comprehensive support matrices tracking lifecycle phases, GA dates, and maintenance transitions for each platform-specific implementation.
