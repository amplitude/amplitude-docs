## Amplitude Instrumentation SDK Ecosystem

Amplitude provides a comprehensive instrumentation ecosystem centered around Analytics and Experiment SDKs that enable event tracking, user analytics, and feature experimentation across multiple platforms. The ecosystem supports both client-side SDKs (Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Unity, Flutter, Unreal) and server-side SDKs (Node.js, Go, Python, Java) with unified APIs and tooling.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

The instrumentation ecosystem consists of three primary components working in concert:

**Analytics SDKs** serve as the foundation for event tracking and user analytics, providing platform-specific implementations that communicate with Amplitude's ingestion endpoints (HTTP V2 API, Batch event upload API). These SDKs support dynamic configuration for optimal server URL selection based on user location and EU data residency requirements.

**Experiment SDKs** enable feature flag and A/B testing capabilities, working alongside Analytics SDKs to track experiment exposure and outcomes through the Evaluation API.

**Ampli** acts as a code generation layer that creates type-safe wrappers around Analytics SDKs based on tracking plans defined in Amplitude Data. This ensures schema validation and provides static type checking for event properties across all supported platforms.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Tracking Plan**: Schema definition in Amplitude Data that specifies event structure, properties, and validation rules, serving as the source of truth for Ampli code generation.

**SDK Middleware/Plugins**: Extensibility mechanisms that allow custom code execution on every event. Middleware is used in maintenance SDKs, while Plugins (with `setup()` and `execute()` methods) are the modern approach in latest SDK versions. Both support enrichment (event modification/filtering) and destination (third-party routing) use cases.

**Dynamic Configuration**: Feature controlled by the `useDynamicConfig` flag that automatically selects optimal ingestion endpoints based on user location, available in iOS 5.3.0+, Android 2.28.0+, JavaScript 8.9.0+, and other modern SDK versions.

**Client Event Time vs Server Upload Time**: Timestamp distinction where Client Event Time represents when the event occurred on the device, while Server Upload Time indicates when Amplitude received the event.

## SDK Lifecycle and Maintenance

The ecosystem follows a structured four-phase lifecycle: Developer Preview/Beta, General Availability (GA), Maintenance, and End-of-Support (EOL). SDKs use X.Y.Z semantic versioning and maintain a comprehensive support matrix tracking lifecycle phases, GA dates, and maintenance transitions across all platforms.

Modern SDK implementations include Amplitude-Kotlin, Amplitude-TypeScript, Amplitude-Swift, while legacy maintenance SDKs continue receiving critical updates. The ecosystem manages dependencies across package managers (npm, CocoaPods, Maven, PyPI) and maintains compatibility with evolving platform requirements.

## API Endpoints and Integration Points

**Core APIs**:
- `amplitude.init()`: SDK initialization with API key and configuration
- `amplitude.track()`: Event tracking with properties
- `amplitude.add()`: Plugin registration for extensibility

**Ampli CLI Commands**:
- `ampli pull`: Generate type-safe wrappers from tracking plans
- `ampli status`: Verify event instrumentation implementation
- `ampli.load()`: Initialize generated wrapper
- `ampli.track()`: Type-safe event tracking

**Configuration Options**:
- `useDynamicConfig`: Enable location-based server selection
- `ServerZone.EU`: EU data residency compliance
- `flushQueueSize`/`flushIntervalMillis`: Batch processing controls

## Debugging and Troubleshooting

The ecosystem provides comprehensive debugging capabilities addressing common issues like missing events, privacy settings affecting IP addresses, Client Event Time discrepancies, device family parsing problems, and user_properties race conditions. Debugging tools include API key validation, batch API monitoring, and device/user ID validation mechanisms.

## Third-Party Integrations

The plugin architecture enables seamless integration with third-party services including Segment, Hotjar, Google Analytics, FullStory, and other analytics platforms through destination plugins that route events while maintaining Amplitude as the primary analytics backbone.
