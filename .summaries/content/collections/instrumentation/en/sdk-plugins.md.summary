## Summary
The SDK Plugins documentation explains how to extend Amplitude's functionality through plugins, which can enrich, transform, filter, or route events to third-party destinations. It details the plugin interface with `setup()` and `execute()` methods, and provides implementation examples for both enrichment plugins (modifying events) and destination plugins (sending events to external services).
