## Amplitude Activation: AI-Powered Audience Segmentation and Personalization Platform

Amplitude Activation is a comprehensive audience segmentation and personalization platform that leverages machine learning and AI to transform user behavior data into actionable insights for marketing campaigns and user engagement optimization. The platform operates primarily in the US region and focuses on predictive analytics rather than traditional historical behavior analysis.

## Core Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The platform consists of four interconnected modules that work together to create a complete audience intelligence workflow:

**Computations** serve as the foundational data transformation layer, converting raw events and event properties into computed user properties through three computation types: event count, aggregation, and first/last value computations. These computed properties feed into other platform modules and can be synced to external destinations for campaign activation.

**Predictions** utilize transformer-based sequence models to generate probabilistic scores for user likelihood to perform future actions. The prediction engine analyzes user activity sequences, event properties, and user properties to create predictive cohorts that can be used across the platform's other features.

**Recommendations** employ AutoML clustering algorithms to deliver personalized item suggestions through three recommendation types: Top Trending, Most Popular, and AI Based recommendations. The system supports assortment personalization, next-best action optimization, and cross-sell campaigns.

**Third-Party Syncs** provide the activation layer, enabling cohorts, properties, computations, and predictions to be synchronized with external marketing platforms through on-demand, automated, and real-time sync mechanisms.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Cohorts**: User segments defined by specific behavioral criteria or predictive characteristics that serve as the foundation for targeting and analysis.

**Computed User Properties**: Transformed data points derived from events or event properties, categorized as event count computations (frequency-based), aggregation computations (sum/average calculations), or first/last value computations (temporal data points).

**Predictive Cohorts**: Machine learning-generated user segments based on probabilistic scoring of future behavior likelihood rather than historical patterns.

**Starting Cohort**: The initial user population used to train prediction models and define the scope of predictive analysis.

**Outcome Events**: Target behaviors or actions that the platform optimizes for in predictions and recommendations.

**Exposure Events**: User interactions that trigger recommendation delivery or prediction scoring.

**Feature Importance Rankings**: Model interpretability metrics that identify which events and user properties most significantly influence prediction accuracy.

**AUC (Area Under Curve)**: Model performance metric measuring the prediction system's ability to distinguish between users who will and won't perform target actions.

**Relative Lift**: Performance measurement comparing predictive cohort results against baseline or control group performance.

## Integration with Broader Product Ecosystem

Amplitude Activation integrates deeply with the broader Amplitude analytics ecosystem, leveraging Event Segmentation charts, Funnel Analysis, and Retention Analysis for model training and performance validation. The platform requires a minimum of 100,000 Monthly Active Users (MAU) and supports user populations between 1,000 and 10 million users for optimal model performance.

The system connects with major marketing platforms including Braze, Iterable, Facebook Custom Audiences, and Google Customer Lists through its sync infrastructure. Integration with Amplitude's core analytics platform enables seamless data flow from behavioral tracking to predictive modeling to campaign activation.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Profile API**: Primary endpoint for retrieving recommendations and user data
- REST endpoint authentication using Secret Keys
- Supports user_id and device_id query parameters
- Returns JSON responses with rec_id, is_control, and items fields
- Enables real-time personalization for connected content systems

**Sync Management**: Automated workflows for cohort and property synchronization
- CSV export capabilities for sync history analysis
- User identifier mapping with amplitude_id resolution
- Incremental change tracking for real-time sync (RTS) operations
- Error handling for unresolved mapping and partner rejection scenarios

**Event Tracking**: Integration points for outcome and exposure event measurement
- [Recs] Recommendation Event for tracking recommendation performance
- UTM parameter tracking for campaign attribution
