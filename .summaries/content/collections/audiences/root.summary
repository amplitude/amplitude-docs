# Amplitude Activation Product Overview

Amplitude Activation is a comprehensive user segmentation and personalization platform that enables businesses to transform analytics insights into targeted marketing actions. The platform leverages data-driven insights and AI-powered features to optimize marketing campaigns and deliver personalized user experiences.

## Key Features and Capabilities

### Computations
Computations transform event data into computed user properties that can be used for segmentation and personalization. Unlike cohorts which group users, computations store specific values as integers attached to individual users, providing more flexibility for targeting.

Types of computations:
- **Event Count Computation**: Counts occurrences of specific events
- **Aggregation Computation**: Performs mathematical operations on event properties
- **First/Last Value Computation**: Captures the first or last value of an event property

Computations can be synced to external destinations like Braze for personalization campaigns and are currently available only in the US region.

### Predictions
Predictions use AI to segment users based on their likelihood to perform future actions. The system employs a transformer-based sequence model analyzing events, properties, and user activity sequences to generate probability scores for each user.

Key applications:
- Optimizing communication frequency
- Implementing dynamic pricing strategies
- Personalizing content delivery

Predictions are recalculated daily or hourly and provide model performance metrics including AUC (accuracy), true/false positive rates, and feature importance analysis.

### Recommendations
Recommendations determine which items are most likely to drive users toward a predictive goal using AutoML. The system clusters users based on properties and behaviors to generate personalized item rankings that update hourly.

Recommendation types:
- **Top Trending**: Items gaining popularity recently
- **Most Popular**: Items with highest overall engagement
- **AI Based**: Personalized recommendations using machine learning

Recommendations are ideal for ecommerce, marketplace, and B2C companies for use cases like assortment personalization and cross-selling.

### Third-Party Syncs
Amplitude allows syncing user data to third-party destinations through:
- **On-demand syncs**: Manual, one-time syncs
- **Automated syncs**: Scheduled recurring syncs
- **Real-time syncs**: Immediate syncs when users enter or exit cohorts

## Product Relationships and Architecture

Amplitude Activation functions as the activation layer within the broader Amplitude ecosystem:

1. **Data Collection**: User events and properties are collected in Amplitude's analytics platform
2. **Analysis & Segmentation**: Data is processed through computations, predictions, and recommendations
3. **Activation**: Insights are deployed through third-party syncs to marketing platforms

The platform uses a Profile API for deploying recommendations and predictions in real-time personalization scenarios.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Cohort**: A group of users sharing common characteristics or behaviors
- **Predictive Cohort**: A segment of users based on their likelihood to perform a future action
- **Feature Importance**: Metrics showing which user attributes most strongly influence prediction outcomes
- **AUC (Area Under Curve)**: A measure of prediction model accuracy
- **Lift**: The improvement in conversion rate for users exposed to personalized content versus a control group
- **Item Catalog**: The collection of items available for recommendation
- **Outcome Event**: The target action that recommendations aim to encourage
- **Exposure Event**: The event that tracks when a user sees a recommendation
- **Control Group**: Users who don't receive personalized content, used for measuring effectiveness

## API and Integration Details

### Profile API
Used to retrieve personalized recommendations:
```
GET https://profile-api.amplitude.com/v1/userprofile?user_id=USER_ID&api_key=API_KEY
```

Required parameters:
- `user_id`: The unique identifier for the user
- `api_key`: Your Amplitude API key

Optional parameters:
- `is_control`: Boolean flag to determine if user is in control group

### Third-Party Integrations
Amplitude Activation supports integrations with numerous platforms including:
- Braze for campaign management
- Facebook Custom Audiences for ad targeting
- Various email marketing platforms
- Customer data platforms (CDPs)

## Use Cases

1. **Predictive Campaign Targeting**: Create prediction-based cohorts and sync to marketing platforms
2. **Personalized Recommendations**: Deploy recommendation models via Profile API in applications
3. **Dynamic Pricing**: Identify price-sensitive users and implement variable pricing strategies
4. **Content Personalization**: Recommend content based on user interests and optimize for engagement

The platform supports multivariate testing and provides detailed analytics on campaign performance, allowing marketers to continuously refine their personalization strategies.
