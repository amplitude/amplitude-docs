# Amplitude Activation Product Overview

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude Activation is a comprehensive user segmentation and personalization platform that transforms behavioral data into actionable marketing campaigns. The platform enables businesses to predict user actions, deliver personalized recommendations, and convert raw event data into meaningful user properties.

Core capabilities include:
- AI-powered behavioral predictions
- Personalized item recommendations
- Event data transformation into user properties
- Integration with third-party marketing platforms

Amplitude Activation serves marketing teams, product managers, and data analysts who need to create targeted segments, improve conversion rates, and deliver personalized user experiences based on behavioral data.

## Product Relationships and Features

Amplitude Activation's feature set forms an interconnected workflow:

1. **Computations** form the foundation by transforming raw event data into computed user properties that enable advanced segmentation. These properties capture user behaviors as numerical values attached to user profiles.

2. **Predictions** leverage user data to forecast future behaviors, creating predictive cohorts for proactive targeting. These use transformer-based sequence models to analyze patterns and predict outcomes.

3. **Recommendations** analyze user behavior patterns to suggest relevant items, available in three types:
   - Top Trending: Recently popular items
   - Most Popular: Consistently high-performing items
   - AI-Based: Personalized suggestions using behavioral patterns

4. **Third-party syncs** connect Amplitude data with external marketing platforms, enabling activation through various channels. These can be configured as on-demand, automated, or real-time syncs.

The typical workflow progresses from data transformation (Computations) to insight generation (Predictions/Recommendations) to activation (Third-party syncs) and measurement.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Cohorts**: User groups sharing common characteristics or behaviors
- **Predictive cohorts**: User segments based on likelihood to perform future actions
- **Computed user properties**: Transformed event data stored as integer values attached to users
- **Feature importance**: Metrics showing which user attributes most influence prediction outcomes
- **AUC (Area Under Curve)**: Statistical measure of prediction model accuracy
- **Lift**: Measurement of improvement in conversion rates compared to baseline
- **Control groups**: User segments excluded from campaigns to measure effectiveness
- **Item catalog**: Collection of items available for recommendation to users
- **Transformer-based sequence model**: AI model analyzing event sequences for predictions
- **Profile API**: Interface for retrieving personalized recommendations for specific users
- **On-demand syncs**: Manually triggered one-time data transfers
- **Automated syncs**: Scheduled recurring data transfers
- **Real-time syncs**: Immediate data transfers when users enter/exit cohorts

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Activation functions as part of the broader Amplitude analytics ecosystem:

1. It builds upon user data collected through Amplitude's core analytics platform
2. Serves as the activation layer that converts analytics insights into marketing actions
3. Integrates with external marketing platforms including Braze and Facebook Custom Audiences
4. Supports various subscription tiers with different feature availability
5. Has regional limitations for certain features (e.g., Computations available only in US region)

The platform bridges the gap between data collection and customer engagement, enabling teams to operationalize their analytics insights through targeted campaigns and personalized experiences.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

### Profile API
Used to retrieve personalized recommendations:
```
GET https://profile-api.amplitude.com/v1/userprofile
```

Required parameters:
- `user_id` or `device_id`: Identifies the user
- `recommendation_source`: Specifies which recommendation model to use
- `is_control`: Boolean flag to determine if user is in control group

Authentication uses a Secret Key in the request header.

### Computation Types
Three types of computations can be configured:
1. **Event count**: Counts occurrences of specific events
2. **Aggregation**: Performs mathematical operations on event properties
3. **First/last value**: Captures the first or last value of an event property

### Sync Implementation
Three types of syncs are available:
1. **On-demand syncs**: Manually triggered one-time syncs
2. **Automated syncs**: Scheduled recurring syncs (daily, hourly)
3. **Real-time syncs**: Immediate syncs when users enter or exit cohorts

Each sync type has specific configuration options and limitations based on the subscription plan.
