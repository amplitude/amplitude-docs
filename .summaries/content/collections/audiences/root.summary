# Amplitude Activation Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude Activation is a comprehensive user segmentation and personalization platform that enables businesses to create targeted marketing campaigns based on user behavior data. The platform leverages AI and machine learning to predict user actions, generate personalized recommendations, and transform event data into actionable user properties. Key features include Predictions, Recommendations, Computations, and Third-Party Syncs, all designed to help businesses optimize their marketing efforts and improve conversion rates.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Predictions
Predictions use AI-powered transformer-based sequence models to forecast user behavior by analyzing event sequences, properties, and user activity patterns. These models generate probabilistic scores indicating a user's likelihood to perform specific future actions, enabling businesses to create predictive cohorts for targeted campaigns.

### Recommendations
The Recommendations feature employs AutoML to determine which items are most likely to drive users toward conversion goals. It offers three types of recommendation models:
- AI Based: Personalized recommendations using machine learning clustering
- Top Trending: Items gaining popularity in a specific timeframe
- Most Popular: Items with highest engagement overall

### Computations
Computations transform events or event properties into computed user properties that can be used for segmentation and personalization. Three types are available:
- Event Count: Tracks how many times a user performs a specific event
- Aggregation: Calculates sum, average, minimum, or maximum of numeric event properties
- First/Last Value: Captures the first or last value of an event property

### Third-Party Syncs
This feature allows businesses to export user cohorts and data to external marketing platforms through three sync types:
- On-demand: Manual, one-time exports
- Automated: Scheduled, recurring exports
- Real-time: Immediate syncing when users enter or exit cohorts

## Product Relationships and Architecture

Amplitude Activation functions as part of the broader Amplitude analytics ecosystem, with its features designed to work together in a cohesive workflow:

1. **Data Collection**: User behavior data is collected through Amplitude's analytics platform
2. **Analysis & Modeling**: Predictions and Recommendations analyze this data to create models
3. **Segmentation**: Models generate cohorts based on predicted behaviors or computed properties
4. **Activation**: Cohorts are synced to marketing platforms for campaign execution
5. **Measurement**: Campaign performance is analyzed to optimize future efforts

The platform is designed to close the loop between analytics and action, allowing businesses to not just understand user behavior but to act on those insights through personalized campaigns.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Predictive Cohorts**: User segments based on likelihood to perform future actions
- **Confidence Score**: Metric indicating reliability of recommendations (0-100%)
- **Lift Against Baseline**: Performance metric showing improvement over non-personalized approach
- **Feature Importance**: Analysis showing which user behaviors most influence predictions
- **AUC (Area Under Curve)**: Accuracy metric for predictive models (0.5-1.0)
- **Percentile Ranking**: User scoring method based on likelihood to convert
- **Outcome Event**: The target conversion event for recommendations or predictions
- **Exposure Event**: Event that tracks when a user sees a recommendation
- **Control Group**: User segment that doesn't receive personalized treatment for comparison
- **Computed User Properties**: Transformed event data stored as user attributes
