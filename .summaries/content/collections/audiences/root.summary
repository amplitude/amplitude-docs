Amplitude Activation is an AI-powered customer segmentation and personalization platform that transforms user behavioral data into actionable insights for targeted marketing campaigns. The platform leverages machine learning models to predict user behavior, create dynamic audience segments, generate personalized recommendations, and synchronize these insights to external marketing tools for campaign execution.

## Core Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The platform operates through four interconnected modules that form a complete customer activation workflow:

**Computations** function as the foundational data transformation layer, converting raw events and event properties into computed user properties. These include event count computations (frequency tracking), aggregation computations (sum/average calculations), and first/last value computations (temporal property capture). These computed properties serve as inputs for other modules and enable basic segmentation capabilities.

**Predictions** utilize transformer-based sequence models to analyze behavioral patterns and forecast future user actions. The system processes up to 128 events per user to generate predictive cohorts based on likelihood percentiles, creating probabilistic user segments that can be leveraged across the platform for targeting.

**Recommendations** employ AutoML clustering algorithms with hourly retraining cycles to generate personalized content suggestions and next-best actions. The system creates dynamic recommendations based on real-time user behavior patterns and can be accessed via the Profile API.

**Third-Party Syncs** serve as the distribution mechanism, enabling real-time, automated, or on-demand synchronization of cohorts, properties, computations, and predictions to external marketing platforms through a comprehensive destination catalog.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments based on behavioral patterns, predictions, or computed properties that can be synchronized to external destinations for campaign targeting.

**Predictive Cohorts**: Machine learning-generated user segments based on likelihood percentiles to perform specific future actions, created using transformer-based sequence models.

**Outcome Events**: Target behaviors that the platform optimizes for, such as purchases, conversions, or engagement actions that serve as training targets for ML models.

**Exposure Events**: Trigger events indicating when a user has been exposed to a recommendation or campaign element, used for performance measurement and attribution.

**Feature Importance Rankings**: ML-generated scores indicating which events and user properties most strongly predict desired outcomes, providing interpretability for model decisions.

**Real-time Sync (RTS)**: Immediate synchronization capability for pushing audience updates to external platforms without delay.

## Ecosystem Integration and Platform Connectivity

Amplitude Activation integrates with the broader Amplitude analytics ecosystem, leveraging behavioral data from Amplitude Analytics to power its AI models. The platform connects to external marketing tools through its destination catalog, supporting major platforms including:

- **Customer Engagement Platforms**: Braze, Iterable for campaign execution and messaging
- **Advertising Platforms**: Facebook Custom Audiences, Google Customer Lists for paid media targeting
- **Data Infrastructure**: S3 for data export and analysis workflows
- **Content Personalization**: Movable Ink for dynamic content delivery

The platform supports bidirectional sync capabilities, enabling campaign performance data to flow back into Amplitude for closed-loop optimization and lift measurement analysis.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Profile API**: Primary REST endpoint for retrieving recommendations and user properties
- Authentication via Secret Key authorization
- Supports user_id and device_id parameter queries
- Returns JSON responses with rec_id, is_control, and items fields for recommendation delivery

**Sync Management APIs**: Programmatic control over cohort and property synchronization
- On-demand sync triggering capabilities
- Automated sync scheduling configuration
- CSV export functionality for sync history analysis and monitoring

**Event Tracking Integration**: Measurement endpoints for recommendation performance
- [Recs] Recommendation Event tracking for outcome measurement
- UTM parameter support for campaign attribution analysis
- Funnel conversion analysis with statistical significance testing

The platform operates with specific technical constraints including US region availability for computations, monthly active user thresholds for predictions activation, and hourly retraining cycles for recommendations optimization. Performance benchmarks typically demonstrate 5-20% lift over traditional behavioral cohorts through AI-powered audience segmentation and personalization capabilities.
