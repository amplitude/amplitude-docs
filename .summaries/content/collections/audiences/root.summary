Amplitude Activation is a comprehensive AI-powered customer segmentation and personalization platform that transforms behavioral data into actionable insights for marketing campaigns, dynamic pricing strategies, and content personalization. The platform leverages machine learning and predictive analytics to help businesses optimize user engagement through automated audience targeting and personalized recommendations.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The platform consists of four interconnected core features that create a complete personalization ecosystem:

**Computations** serve as the foundational data transformation layer, converting raw events and event properties into computed user properties through three computation types: event count, aggregation, and first/last value computations. These computed properties feed into other platform features and can be synced to external destinations.

**Predictions** utilize transformer-based sequence models to analyze user behavior patterns and generate probabilistic scores indicating likelihood of future actions. These AI-powered predictions create predictive cohorts that move beyond historical behavior analysis to forecast user intent, enabling proactive campaign targeting.

**Recommendations** employ AutoML clustering algorithms with hourly retraining to deliver personalized item suggestions through three recommendation types: Top Trending, Most Popular, and AI-Based recommendations. The system uses outcome events and exposure events to continuously optimize recommendation accuracy.

**Third-Party Syncs** provide the distribution mechanism, enabling seamless integration with external platforms through on-demand, automated, and real-time sync capabilities for cohorts, properties, computations, and predictions.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Cohorts**: User segments defined by shared characteristics or behaviors, with predictive cohorts representing users segmented by likelihood of future actions rather than past behavior.

**Computed User Properties**: Derived data points created from raw events through computations, including event counts, property aggregations, and first/last value captures.

**Outcome Events**: Target actions that define success metrics for predictions and recommendations, such as purchases or conversions.

**Exposure Events**: User interactions with recommended items or content that trigger the recommendation algorithm.

**Event Properties**: Metadata associated with user actions that provide context for segmentation and personalization.

**Profile API**: Real-time REST endpoint (`/profile`) that serves personalized recommendations with control/treatment flags for A/B testing.

**Feature Importance Rankings**: Machine learning model outputs that identify which events and user properties most strongly influence prediction accuracy.

**Control Groups**: Baseline user segments that receive standard experiences for measuring lift and statistical significance of personalization efforts.

## Platform Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Activation integrates extensively with major marketing and analytics platforms through its sync infrastructure. Key integrations include:

- **Marketing Platforms**: Braze, Iterable, Facebook Custom Audiences, Google Customer Lists
- **Data Storage**: Amazon S3 for bulk data exports
- **Analytics Integration**: Event Segmentation charts, Funnel Analysis charts, Retention Analysis charts
- **API Access**: Profile API for real-time recommendation serving with authentication via Secret Key

The platform supports both one-way and two-way syncs, enabling cohort membership updates, user property mapping, and real-time audience activation across the marketing technology stack.

## Technical Implementation

**API Endpoints**: The primary API endpoint is the Profile API (`/profile`) which accepts `user_id` and `device_id` parameters and returns JSON responses containing personalized recommendations with `rec_id`, `is_control` flags, and `recommendation_source` metadata.

**Sync Operations**: Three sync types are available - on-demand manual syncs, automated scheduled syncs (hourly/daily), and real-time syncs with minute-level updates. All syncs include comprehensive logging, email notifications, and CSV export capabilities for troubleshooting.

**Performance Metrics**: The platform provides detailed analytics including AUC scores, True/False Positive Rates, Log loss, conversion rate lift, relative lift calculations, and statistical significance testing for campaign optimization.

**Regional Availability**: Computations are currently limited to US region only, while other features appear to have broader availability.

The platform is designed for ecommerce, marketplace, and B2C companies seeking to implement sophisticated personalization strategies with measurable business impact through predictive analytics and machine learning-driven user segmentation.
