# Amplitude Activation Product Overview

Amplitude Activation is a comprehensive audience segmentation and personalization platform that transforms raw user data into actionable insights and automated personalization campaigns. It enables businesses to optimize user targeting, engagement, and conversion through AI-powered features.

## Key Features and Capabilities

### Predictions
Predictions leverage AI to segment users based on their likelihood to perform future actions. Using a transformer-based sequence model, it analyzes events, properties, and user activity sequences to calculate probabilistic scores. This enables:
- Communication frequency optimization
- Dynamic pricing strategies
- Content personalization

### Recommendations
Recommendations determine which items are most likely to drive users toward a predictive goal using AutoML technology. The system:
- Clusters users based on properties and behaviors
- Analyzes historical data patterns
- Generates personalized ranked item lists that update hourly
- Works particularly well for ecommerce, marketplace, B2C, and subscription software companies

### Computations
Computations transform events or event properties into computed user properties for segmentation and personalization. Unlike cohorts, computations store values as integers attached to individual users. Three types are available:
- Event count computation
- Aggregation computation
- First/last value computation

### Third-Party Syncs
This feature allows syncing user data from Amplitude to third-party destinations using:
- On-demand syncs (manual, one-time exports)
- Automated syncs (scheduled, recurring exports)
- Real-time syncs (immediate updates when users enter/exit cohorts)

## Product Relationships and Architecture

Amplitude Activation integrates with the broader Amplitude analytics ecosystem:

1. **Data Flow**: User events and properties from Amplitude Analytics serve as inputs for Activation features.

2. **Feature Interdependencies**:
   - Predictions create predictive cohorts
   - Cohorts can be synced to third-party platforms
   - Computations create user properties that enhance segmentation capabilities
   - Recommendations leverage user behavior data to generate personalized item lists

3. **Integration Points**:
   - Profile API for deploying recommendations
   - Third-party destination syncing for cohorts
   - External platform integrations (Braze, Facebook Custom Audience)

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Predictive Cohorts**: User segments based on likelihood to perform future actions
- **Computed User Properties**: Transformed event data stored as user-level attributes
- **Exposure Event**: Event indicating a user has seen a recommendation
- **Outcome Event**: Target event that recommendations aim to drive
- **Confidence Score**: Metric indicating reliability of recommendation predictions
- **AUC (Area Under Curve)**: Accuracy metric for predictive models
- **Feature Importance**: Ranking of which user attributes most influence predictions
- **Control Group**: User segment excluded from personalization for comparison
- **Lift**: Improvement in conversion rate compared to a baseline

## API and Integration Points

### Profile API
Used to deploy recommendation models in personalization campaigns:
```
GET /api/2/profile/recommendations
```

Key parameters:
- `user_id`: The user to retrieve recommendations for
- `is_control`: Boolean flag to determine if user is in control group

Authentication requires an API key in the request header.

### Third-Party Sync Endpoints
Amplitude supports syncing cohorts to various destinations including:
- Braze
- Facebook Custom Audience
- Other marketing platforms

   - Cross-sell opportunities

3. **Campaign Measurement**:
   - Relative lift analysis
   - Incremental conversion tracking
   - Statistical significance testing

4. **User Property Transformation**:
   - Converting event data to user-level attributes
   - Enabling more sophisticated segmentation
   - Supporting personalization campaigns
