**Summary:** This documentation covers Amplitude Computations, a US-region-only segmentation tool that transforms events or event properties into computed user properties with three types: event count, aggregation, and first/last value, which can be synced to external destinations like Braze, S3, and Profile API for personalization campaigns.
