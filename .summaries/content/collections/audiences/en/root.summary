# Amplitude Activation: Product Overview

Amplitude Activation is a comprehensive user segmentation and personalization platform that helps businesses optimize their marketing campaigns and user experiences through data-driven insights and AI-powered tools. The platform enables companies to transform raw user data into actionable segments and personalized recommendations.

## Key Features and Capabilities

### 1. Predictive Cohorts
Amplitude Predictions uses AI and transformer-based sequence models to segment users based on their likelihood to perform future actions. The system analyzes events, properties, and user activity sequences to calculate probabilistic scores, enabling businesses to target users with the highest conversion potential.

### 2. Recommendations
The Recommendations feature employs AutoML to determine which items are most likely to drive users toward a predictive goal. It clusters users based on properties and behaviors, analyzes historical data, and generates personalized item rankings that update hourly. Three recommendation types are available:
- AI Based: Personalized recommendations using machine learning
- Top Trending: Items gaining popularity in a specific timeframe
- Most Popular: Items with highest engagement overall

### 3. Computations
Computations transform events or event properties into computed user properties that can be used for segmentation and personalization. Unlike cohorts, computations store values as integers attached to individual users. Three types are available:
- Event count: Counts occurrences of specific events
- Aggregation: Performs calculations on event properties
- First/last value: Captures the first or last value of a property

### 4. Third-Party Syncs
Amplitude allows syncing user data to third-party destinations through:
- On-demand syncs: Manual, one-time exports
- Automated syncs: Scheduled, recurring exports
- Real-time syncs: Immediate updates when users enter/exit cohorts

## Product Relationships and Architecture

Amplitude Activation works within the broader Amplitude ecosystem, serving as the action layer that operationalizes insights from Amplitude Analytics. The platform consists of several interconnected components:

1. **Cohort Creation Tools**: Predictive models, computations, and manual segmentation tools for defining user groups
2. **Destination Integrations**: Connections to marketing platforms like Braze and Facebook Custom Audience
3. **Profile API**: Enables real-time access to user data and recommendations
4. **Performance Measurement**: Tools to analyze campaign effectiveness and model accuracy

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Predictive Cohorts**: User segments based on likelihood to perform future actions
- **Feature Importance**: Metrics showing which user behaviors most influence predictions
- **AUC (Area Under Curve)**: Accuracy metric for prediction models
- **Exposure Event**: The event that triggers a recommendation to be shown to a user
- **Outcome Event**: The target action you want users to take after seeing a recommendation
- **Confidence Score**: Measure of statistical certainty in recommendation effectiveness
- **Lift Against Baseline**: Performance improvement compared to non-personalized approach
- **Computed User Properties**: Numeric values derived from user behaviors and attached to user profiles
- **Control Group**: Users who don't receive personalized treatment, used for comparison

## Integration with External Systems

Amplitude Activation integrates with marketing platforms and other systems through:

1. **Profile API**: For retrieving recommendations and user data
   - Endpoint: `https://profile-api.amplitude.com/v1/userprofile`
   - Authentication: Secret Key required in request headers
   - Parameters include `user_id`, `recommendation_source`, and `is_control`

2. **Third-Party Destination Syncs**: For sending cohort data to external platforms
   - Supports platforms like Braze, Facebook, and others
   - Can map Amplitude user properties to destination fields

## Use Cases

1. **Campaign Targeting**: Identify and target users most likely to convert
2. **Dynamic Pricing**: Offer personalized pricing based on user behavior
3. **Content Personalization**: Show the most relevant content to each user
4. **Cross-Selling**: Recommend complementary products based on purchase history
5. **Assortment Personalization**: Customize product displays for different user segments

## Limitations and Considerations

- Some features (like Computations) are only available in the US region
- Different sync capabilities are available based on subscription plan
- Recommendations are best suited for ecommerce, marketplace, and B2C companies
- Models are retrained hourly to incorporate the latest user behavior data
- Control groups should be established to properly measure campaign effectiveness
