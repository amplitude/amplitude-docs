# Amplitude Activation Product Overview

Amplitude Activation is a comprehensive user segmentation and personalization platform that helps businesses optimize their marketing campaigns and user experiences through data-driven insights and AI-powered features.

## Key Features and Capabilities

### 1. Computations
Computations transform events or event properties into computed user properties that can be used for segmentation and personalization. Unlike cohorts, computations store values as integers attached to individual users, making them more flexible for targeting and analysis. Three types of computations are available:
- **Event Count Computation**: Counts occurrences of specific events
- **Aggregation Computation**: Performs mathematical operations on event properties
- **First/Last Value Computation**: Captures the first or last value of an event property

Computations can be synced to external destinations like Braze for personalization campaigns and are currently available only in the US region.

### 2. Predictions
Predictions use AI to segment users based on their likelihood to perform future actions. The system employs a transformer-based sequence model that analyzes events, properties, and user activity sequences to generate probability scores for each user. These predictions help optimize:
- Communication frequency
- Dynamic pricing strategies
- Content personalization

Predictions are recalculated daily or hourly and can be used to create predictive cohorts for targeting campaigns. The system provides model performance metrics including AUC (accuracy), true/false positive rates, and feature importance analysis to help understand what factors influence user behavior.

### 3. Recommendations
Recommendations determine which items are most likely to drive users toward a predictive goal using AutoML. The system clusters users based on properties and behaviors to generate personalized item rankings that update hourly. Three types of recommendations are available:
- **Top Trending**: Items gaining popularity in a recent timeframe
- **Most Popular**: Items with highest engagement overall
- **AI Based**: Personalized recommendations using machine learning

Recommendations are best suited for user-based personalization in ecommerce, marketplace, and B2C companies, supporting use cases like assortment personalization, next-best action suggestions, and cross-selling.

### 4. Third-Party Syncs
Amplitude allows syncing user data to third-party destinations through three methods:
- **On-demand syncs**: Manual, one-time syncs
- **Automated syncs**: Scheduled recurring syncs
- **Real-time syncs**: Immediate syncs when users enter or exit cohorts

These syncs enable the activation of audience segments across marketing platforms and analytics tools.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

Amplitude Activation sits within the broader Amplitude product ecosystem, serving as the activation layer that puts analytics insights into action. The key components work together as follows:

1. **Data Collection**: User events and properties are collected in Amplitude's analytics platform
2. **Analysis & Segmentation**: Data is processed through computations, predictions, and recommendations
3. **Activation**: Insights are deployed through third-party syncs to marketing platforms

The platform uses a Profile API for deploying recommendations and predictions in real-time personalization scenarios. This API requires authentication and accepts parameters to retrieve personalized recommendations for specific users.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Cohort**: A group of users who share common characteristics or behaviors
- **Predictive Cohort**: A segment of users based on their likelihood to perform a future action
- **Feature Importance**: Metrics showing which user attributes most strongly influence prediction outcomes
- **AUC (Area Under Curve)**: A measure of prediction model accuracy
- **Lift**: The improvement in conversion rate for users exposed to personalized content versus a control group
- **Item Catalog**: The collection of items (products, content, etc.) available for recommendation
- **Outcome Event**: The target action that recommendations aim to encourage
- **Exposure Event**: The event that tracks when a user sees a recommendation
- **Control Group**: Users who don't receive personalized content, used for measuring effectiveness

## API and Integration Details

### Profile API
Used to retrieve personalized recommendations:
```
GET https://profile-api.amplitude.com/v1/userprofile?user_id=USER_ID&api_key=API_KEY
```

Required parameters:
- `user_id`: The unique identifier for the user
- `api_key`: Your Amplitude API key

Optional parameters:
- `is_control`: Boolean flag to determine if user is in control group

The API returns a JSON response with personalized recommendations and confidence scores.

### Third-Party Integrations
Amplitude Activation supports integrations with numerous platforms including:
- Braze for campaign management
- Facebook Custom Audiences for ad targeting
- Various email marketing platforms
- Customer data platforms (CDPs)

## Use Cases and Implementation

1. **Predictive Campaign Targeting**:
   - Create prediction-based cohorts
   - Sync cohorts to marketing platforms
   - Set up control groups for measurement
   - Analyze campaign results using lift metrics

2. **Personalized Recommendations**:
   - Build recommendation models based on user behavior
   - Deploy via Profile API in web/mobile applications
   - Track exposure events when recommendations are shown
   - Measure performance through conversion lift

3. **Dynamic Pricing**:
   - Use predictions to identify price-sensitive users
   - Implement inverse pricing strategies
   - Test different price points across segments

4. **Content Personalization**:
   - Recommend content based on user interests
   - Optimize for engagement or conversion goals
   - Measure effectiveness through A/B testing
