# Amplitude Activation Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude Activation is a comprehensive user segmentation and personalization platform that enables businesses to create targeted marketing campaigns based on user behavior data. The platform leverages AI and machine learning to help companies predict user actions, deliver personalized recommendations, and transform event data into actionable user properties.

Key features of Amplitude Activation include:
- Predictions: AI-powered forecasting of user behavior
- Recommendations: Personalized item suggestions for users
- Computations: Transformation of event data into user properties
- Third-party syncs: Integration with external marketing platforms

The platform is designed for marketing teams, product managers, and data analysts who need to create targeted user segments, optimize conversion rates, and deliver personalized experiences.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

Amplitude Activation consists of several interconnected features that work together to enable data-driven personalization:

1. **Computations** serve as the foundation by transforming raw event data into computed user properties that can be used for segmentation.

2. **Predictions** build on user data to forecast future behaviors, creating predictive cohorts that can be used for targeting.

3. **Recommendations** leverage user behavior patterns to suggest relevant items to users, available in three types: Top Trending, Most Popular, and AI-Based.

4. **Third-party syncs** connect Amplitude data with external marketing platforms, enabling the activation of insights through various channels.

The workflow typically follows this pattern:
- Create computed user properties from event data
- Build predictions or recommendations based on these properties
- Sync resulting cohorts to marketing platforms
- Measure campaign performance and iterate

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Cohorts**: Groups of users who share common characteristics or behaviors
- **Predictive cohorts**: User segments based on their likelihood to perform future actions
- **Computed user properties**: Transformed event data stored as integer values attached to individual users
- **Feature importance**: Metrics showing which user attributes most strongly influence prediction outcomes
- **AUC (Area Under Curve)**: Accuracy metric for predictive models
- **Lift**: Measurement of improvement in conversion rates compared to a baseline
- **Control groups**: User segments excluded from campaigns to measure effectiveness
- **Item catalog**: Collection of items that can be recommended to users
- **Transformer-based sequence model**: AI model that analyzes event sequences to make predictions
- **Profile API**: Interface for retrieving personalized recommendations for specific users

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Activation appears to be part of a broader Amplitude analytics ecosystem. While the documentation doesn't explicitly detail all connections, it's clear that:

1. Amplitude Activation builds upon user data collected through Amplitude's analytics platform
2. It integrates with external marketing platforms like Braze and Facebook Custom Audiences
3. The platform supports various subscription tiers with different feature availability
4. Some features (like Computations) are only available in specific regions (US region)

The platform serves as the activation layer that turns analytics insights into actionable marketing campaigns, bridging the gap between data collection and customer engagement.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

### Profile API
Used to retrieve personalized recommendations:
```
GET https://profile-api.amplitude.com/v1/userprofile
```

Required parameters:
- `user_id` or `device_id`: Identifies the user
- `recommendation_source`: Specifies which recommendation model to use
- `is_control`: Boolean flag to determine if user is in control group

Authentication uses a Secret Key in the request header.

### Sync Implementation
Three types of syncs are available:
1. **On-demand syncs**: Manually triggered one-time syncs
2. **Automated syncs**: Scheduled recurring syncs (daily, hourly)
3. **Real-time syncs**: Immediate syncs when users enter or exit cohorts

Each sync type has specific configuration options and limitations based on the subscription plan.

### Computation Types
Three types of computations can be configured:
1. **Event count**: Counts occurrences of specific events
2. **Aggregation**: Performs mathematical operations on event properties
3. **First/last value**: Captures the first or last value of an event property
