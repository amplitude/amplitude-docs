## Amplitude Activation: AI-Powered Customer Segmentation and Personalization Platform

Amplitude Activation is a comprehensive customer engagement platform that leverages machine learning and AI to transform user behavioral data into actionable insights for personalized marketing campaigns. The platform enables businesses to predict user behavior, create dynamic audience segments, generate personalized recommendations, and sync these insights to external marketing tools for campaign execution.

## Core Product Components and Relationships

The platform consists of four interconnected modules that work together to create a complete customer activation workflow:

**Computations** serve as the foundational data transformation layer, converting raw events and event properties into computed user properties. These properties feed into the other modules and can be used for basic segmentation and filtering.

**Predictions** utilize transformer-based sequence models to analyze user behavior patterns and forecast the likelihood of future actions. The predictive models create probabilistic cohorts that can be used across the platform.

**Recommendations** employ AutoML clustering algorithms with hourly retraining to generate personalized content suggestions, product recommendations, and next-best actions based on user behavior patterns.

**Third-Party Syncs** act as the distribution mechanism, enabling real-time, automated, or on-demand synchronization of cohorts, properties, computations, and predictions to external marketing platforms like Braze, Facebook, Google, and Iterable.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments based on behavioral patterns, predictions, or computed properties that can be synced to external destinations for campaign targeting.

**Computed User Properties**: Transformed event data in three types - event count computations (frequency tracking), aggregation computations (sum/average calculations), and first/last value computations (temporal property capture).

**Predictive Cohorts**: Machine learning-generated user segments based on likelihood percentiles to perform specific future actions, created using transformer-based sequence models processing up to 128 events per user.

**Outcome Events**: Target behaviors that the platform optimizes for, such as purchases, conversions, or engagement actions.

**Exposure Events**: Trigger events that indicate when a user has been exposed to a recommendation or campaign element.

**Event Properties**: Metadata associated with user actions that can be transformed into computed properties or used as features in ML models.

**Feature Importance Rankings**: ML-generated scores indicating which events and user properties most strongly predict the desired outcome.

## Integration with Broader Product Ecosystem

Amplitude Activation integrates deeply with the broader Amplitude analytics ecosystem, leveraging behavioral data from Amplitude Analytics to power its AI models. The platform connects to external marketing tools through its destination catalog, supporting major platforms including:

- **Customer Data Platforms**: Braze, Iterable for campaign execution
- **Advertising Platforms**: Facebook Custom Audiences, Google Customer Lists for paid media targeting  
- **Data Storage**: S3 for data export and analysis
- **Email/Content Platforms**: Movable Ink for dynamic content personalization

The platform supports both one-way and two-way sync capabilities, enabling campaign performance data to flow back into Amplitude for closed-loop optimization and lift measurement.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Profile API**: Primary REST endpoint for retrieving recommendations and user properties
- Authentication via Secret Key authorization
- Supports user_id and device_id queries
- Returns JSON responses with rec_id, is_control, and items fields

**Sync Management**: Programmatic control over cohort and property synchronization
- On-demand sync triggering
- Automated sync scheduling
- Real-time sync (RTS) for immediate updates
- CSV export capabilities for sync history analysis

**Event Tracking**: Integration points for outcome and exposure event measurement
- [Recs] Recommendation Event for tracking recommendation performance
- UTM parameter support for campaign attribution
- Funnel conversion analysis with statistical significance testing

The platform processes data with specific technical constraints including US region availability for computations, monthly active user thresholds for predictions, and hourly retraining cycles for recommendations. Performance optimization typically delivers 5-20% lift over traditional behavioral cohorts through its AI-powered approach to audience segmentation and personalization.
