**Summary:** This documentation explains Amplitude's AI-powered predictions feature within Amplitude Activation that uses transformer-based sequence models to segment users by likelihood of future actions rather than past behavior, calculating probabilistic scores from events, event properties, user properties, and activity sequences to optimize targeting workflows for communication frequency, dynamic pricing, and content personalization.
