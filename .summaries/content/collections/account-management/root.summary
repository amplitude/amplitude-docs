Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics platform that provides organizations with behavioral data analysis capabilities through a multi-tiered account management system. The platform operates on a hierarchical structure with organizations containing multiple projects, where each project represents a distinct data collection and analysis environment with its own API keys, event tracking, and user segmentation capabilities.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The platform's core architecture centers around **Organizations** as the top-level entity, containing multiple **Projects** that serve as isolated data environments. Each project maintains its own API keys, secret keys, session definitions, time zones, and currency display settings. The **Portfolio** feature enables Enterprise customers to perform cross-project analysis by creating Views that merge up to 5 projects (expandable to 10) using user ID/device ID matching and the User Mapping API for aliasing.

User management operates through a sophisticated **role-based permission system** with four hierarchical levels: Viewer, Member, Manager, and Admin. These roles control access to organization-level settings, project-level configurations, content creation capabilities, and administrative functions. **Permission Groups** (Enterprise-only) enable bulk user management by assigning project permissions to multiple users simultaneously, with the system automatically granting the highest permission level when users have overlapping assignments.

Data management features include **Scale** (dynamic behavioral sampling for Enterprise plans), **self-service data deletion** capabilities for GDPR/CCPA compliance, and comprehensive **notification systems** for privacy regulation compliance. The platform integrates with identity providers through **SCIM 2.0 provisioning** and supports SSO configuration for enterprise authentication workflows.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**API Keys and Secret Keys**: Project-specific authentication credentials managed through self-service interfaces, with support for up to 50 active keys per project and permanent key operations for legacy systems.

**Dynamic Behavioral Sampling (Scale)**: Enterprise feature that samples events based on user identity to manage costs for high-volume customers while maintaining analysis accuracy through upsampling metrics.

**Views**: Portfolio feature components that merge multiple projects into unified analysis displays using user/device ID matching.

**Session Replay**: Capture functionality with configurable sample rates and privacy controls, integrated into organizational settings.

**User Mapping API**: Service enabling cross-project user identity aliasing for Portfolio analysis.

**Permission Groups**: Enterprise-level user management constructs that assign project permissions to multiple users through group membership.

**Team Spaces**: Collaborative workspaces with integrated permission inheritance and content organization capabilities.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates extensively with external systems through multiple touchpoints. The **User Management API** and **SCIM 2.0 provisioning** enable programmatic user lifecycle management, particularly with identity providers like Okta. **Webhooks** allow Enterprise customers to send triggered monitor notifications to external endpoints when KPI-affecting behavioral changes occur.

The platform supports **Slack integration** for notifications and collaboration, while **SSO configuration** enables enterprise authentication workflows. **CSV export capabilities** and **Usage reports dashboard** provide data portability and consumption analytics.

Revenue analysis capabilities integrate with **Revenue LTV charts**, **Event Segmentation revenue metrics**, and **Data Tables** with configurable currency display units that affect visualization without modifying underlying data values.

## API Endpoints and Technical Interfaces

Key technical interfaces include:

- **User Management API**: Programmatic user and group management with SCIM 2.0 support
- **User Privacy API**: Self-service data deletion and GDPR compliance workflows  
- **User Mapping API**: Cross-project user identity aliasing for Portfolio functionality
- **Webhook endpoints**: Custom monitor notifications for real-time behavioral change alerts
- **SCIM API**: Identity provider integration with support for userName, givenName, familyName, email, and active attributes

The platform operates through web-based interfaces accessed via **Organization settings** menus, with specific sections for Members & Groups, Projects, Access and SSO Settings, and Provisioning Settings. Administrative functions require appropriate role permissions, with scanning limits of 1B events/month for Growth plans and 10B events/month for Enterprise plans for data deletion operations.
