Amplitude's Account Management system serves as the foundational governance layer for the analytics platform, providing comprehensive organizational and project administration through a hierarchical permission model. The system manages user access, billing, compliance, and data governance across Amplitude's entire analytics ecosystem.

## Core Architecture and Features

The account management system operates on a four-tier user role hierarchy (Viewer, Member, Manager, Admin) that controls access to analytics features, content management, and administrative functions at both organizational and project levels. The system centers around organizational settings that govern billing operations, user permission structures, SSO configuration, and Session Replay capture settings with configurable sample rates.

Key administrative capabilities include project configuration management through API keys and secret keys, session parameter definitions, timezone settings, user approval workflows, and comprehensive notification systems designed for GDPR and privacy regulation compliance. The system supports self-service data deletion with scanning limits of 1B events monthly for Growth plans and 10B events monthly for Enterprise plans.

For Enterprise customers managing high event volumes, the Scale feature provides dynamic behavioral sampling based on user identity, enabling cost management while maintaining analytical accuracy through upsampling metrics that statistically correct for sampled data.

## Product Relationships and Integration Points

The account management system integrates deeply with Amplitude's analytics ecosystem through several key mechanisms:

**Portfolio Views** enable cross-project analysis by merging up to 5 projects (10 with approval) into unified analytical displays. This functionality uses user ID/device ID matching combined with the User Mapping API for aliasing different user identifiers across projects, creating seamless cross-project user journey analysis.

**Permission Groups** (Enterprise-only) provide bulk project permission assignment through group membership, automatically granting the highest permission level when users have multiple conflicting assignments. These groups integrate directly with Team Spaces and can be programmatically managed through the User Management API and SCIM API.

**SCIM 2.0 Provisioning** enables automated user and group management through identity provider integration, particularly with Okta, supporting standard user schema fields including userName, givenName, familyName, email, and active status attributes.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**User Role Hierarchy:**
- **Viewer**: Read-only access to discoverable content and basic analytics
- **Member**: Content creation and editing rights for owned content, behavioral cohort access
- **Manager**: Full content management capabilities, user invitation rights, project settings access
- **Admin**: Complete organizational control including billing, SSO configuration, and comprehensive user management

**Project-Level Components:**
- **API Keys/Secret Keys**: Authentication credentials with self-service management capabilities for Enterprise customers (50 active key limit)
- **Session Definitions**: Configurable parameters that define user session boundaries and characteristics
- **Currency Display Units**: Project-specific formatting for revenue visualization and analysis
- **Sample Rate Configuration**: Controls for Session Replay capture frequency and behavioral sampling rates

**Data Management Terminology:**
- **Dynamic Behavioral Sampling**: User identity-based event sampling system for managing high-volume data ingestion
- **Upsampling Metrics**: Statistical correction algorithms that adjust sampled data for accurate analysis
- **Self-Service Data Deletion**: Permanent removal capabilities for specific events and user properties
- **User Privacy Notifications**: Automated GDPR compliance alerts for data deletion and privacy requests

## Ecosystem Integration and Access Control

The account management system controls access to Amplitude's complete analytics suite including Revenue LTV charts, Event Segmentation metrics, Data Tables, Visual Labeling capabilities, custom event creation, and derived property management. It governs content management across dashboards, notebooks, behavioral cohorts, team spaces, and handles content ownership transfers.

The system integrates with external platforms through Slack notifications, webhook configurations for custom monitors, and SSO provider connectivity. For compliance, it connects with the User Privacy API for automated data deletion request processing and maintains GDPR/CCPA compliance workflows.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**User Management API**: Provides programmatic user and group management with full SCIM 2.0 support for identity provider integration

**User Privacy API**: Handles automated processing of data deletion requests and privacy compliance workflows

**User Mapping API**: Enables cross-project user identity aliasing specifically for Portfolio Views functionality

**Key Management Interface**: Self-service API key and secret key lifecycle management (creation, revocation, deletion) accessible through Organization Settings

**Webhook Configuration**: Custom monitor endpoint setup for real-time KPI behavior change notifications (requires Enterprise Insights package)

The system requires specific SDK implementation for Session Replay functionality and supports CSV export configurations for usage reports and analytics data extraction. Administrative functions are centralized through the Organization Settings interface, with advanced features typically requiring Enterprise plan subscriptions and appropriate user role permissions for access.
