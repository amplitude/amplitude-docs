Amplitude's Account Management system is a comprehensive organizational and project-level administration platform that provides hierarchical user management, permissions control, and data governance across Amplitude's analytics ecosystem. The system enables organizations to manage users, control access to features, configure integrations, and maintain data privacy compliance while supporting both individual project analytics and cross-project portfolio analysis.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

The account management system operates on a two-tier hierarchical structure with Organizations at the top level containing multiple Projects. Organizations serve as the primary administrative container, handling billing management, SSO configuration, user provisioning, and cross-project capabilities like Portfolio views. Projects function as data containers with their own analytics datasets, API credentials, session definitions, time zones, and currency configurations.

Permission Groups provide Enterprise customers with scalable user administration by enabling bulk permission assignments across multiple users and projects simultaneously. The system resolves permission conflicts by granting users the highest permission level when they have overlapping assignments from different groups or direct role assignments.

Portfolio functionality allows Enterprise customers to perform unified analysis across up to 5 projects (expandable to 10 with approval) by creating Views that merge project data using user ID/device ID matching, with optional User Mapping API support for cross-project identity aliasing.

## User Roles and Permission Model

The system implements four distinct user roles with escalating privileges:

- **Viewer**: Read-only access to analytics data and dashboards
- **Member**: Content creation capabilities including charts, dashboards, and cohorts
- **Manager**: Project-level administration including user management and project settings
- **Admin**: Organization-wide control including billing, SSO configuration, and cross-project management

Permission Groups enable Enterprise customers to manage user access at scale by creating reusable permission sets that can be applied to multiple users across different projects.

## API Infrastructure and Authentication

The platform provides comprehensive API access through multiple authentication mechanisms:

- **API Keys and Secret Keys**: Project-level authentication credentials for programmatic access
- **User Management API**: SCIM 2.0-compliant endpoint for automated user and group provisioning
- **User Privacy API**: Automated data deletion request processing for GDPR compliance
- **User Mapping API**: Cross-project user identity management for Portfolio functionality
- **Webhooks**: Custom monitor notifications for Enterprise customers when behavioral changes affect KPIs

Enterprise customers can self-manage up to 50 active API keys per organization through the administrative interface, with key rotation capabilities for security management.

## Data Management and Privacy Controls

The account management system includes robust data governance features for privacy compliance and data quality management. Self-service data deletion capabilities allow permanent removal of specific events and properties, with scanning limits of 1B events/month for Growth plans and 10B events/month for Enterprise plans.

Dynamic Behavioral Sampling (Scale) provides Enterprise customers with cost management through intelligent event sampling based on user identity, maintaining analysis accuracy through upsampling metrics while reducing data processing costs for high-volume implementations.

Currency display configuration affects Revenue LTV charts, Event Segmentation metrics, and Data Tables presentation without modifying underlying data values. Project-level time zone and session definition settings provide localization and behavioral analysis customization.

## Integration Ecosystem

The account management system integrates with Amplitude's broader product ecosystem including Team Spaces for collaborative analytics, Visual Labeling for event taxonomy management, Guides and Surveys for user engagement, and behavioral cohorts for audience segmentation. Permission controls determine user access to these integrated capabilities based on assigned roles and group memberships.

SCIM Provisioning enables automated integration with identity providers like Okta for streamlined user lifecycle management. Session Replay Settings provide organizational controls for user session capture with configurable sample rates and privacy controls.

Administrative access is centralized through Organization Settings interfaces, providing Members & Groups management, API key administration, SSO configuration, and project-level settings control. The system supports Slack integration for notifications and provides customizable themes and notification preferences at the user level.
