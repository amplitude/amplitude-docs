## Amplitude Account Management System

Amplitude's Account Management system is a comprehensive organizational governance platform that provides hierarchical administration capabilities for analytics environments. The system enables enterprise-scale management of analytics projects, user access control, and data governance through a structured organizational framework.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

The account management system operates on a three-tier hierarchy: **Organizations** serve as the top-level administrative entity, containing multiple **Projects** that function as individual data containers with distinct configurations. **Portfolio Views** provide the bridge between projects, enabling Enterprise customers to merge 5-10 projects for cross-project analysis. This architecture supports both isolated project management and unified analytics across multiple data sources.

Projects maintain independent configurations including API keys, secret keys, session definitions, time zones, currency display units, and sampling parameters. The Portfolio feature leverages User ID/Device ID matching and the **User Mapping API** to enable user aliasing and cross-project user journey analysis while preserving project-level data isolation.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Organizations**: Top-level administrative entities that contain multiple projects and cascade settings downward

**Projects**: Individual data containers with distinct API keys, configurations, and user property silos

**Portfolio Views**: Enterprise feature enabling cross-project analysis by merging up to 5-10 projects

**Permission Groups**: Enterprise-level bulk user provisioning mechanism for project-level access control

**Scale Feature**: Dynamic behavioral sampling system using user identity-based sampling for high-volume data management

**Key ID**: Unique identifiers for API keys and secret keys in the self-service key management system

**Session Replay**: User session recording functionality with configurable sample rates and capture toggles

**Data Deletion Jobs**: GDPR-compliant permanent removal processes for specific events and properties

## User Management and Access Control

The platform implements a four-tier role hierarchy with escalating permissions:
- **Viewer**: Content access only
- **Member**: Content access and creation
- **Manager**: Administrative functions including API key management
- **Admin**: Full organizational control

Enterprise plans support **Permission Groups** for bulk user provisioning with project-level permission assignment. The system integrates with identity providers through **SCIM 2.0 protocols**, supporting core schema fields (userName, givenName, familyName, email, active status) and providers like Okta through the **User Management API**.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The account management system serves as the foundational governance layer for Amplitude's analytics platform, integrating with:

- **Analytics Core**: Projects feed data to Event Segmentation, Revenue LTV charts, and Data Tables
- **Session Replay**: Project-level configuration controls user session recording
- **Webhooks**: Enterprise webhook endpoints trigger external system alerts for KPI-related behavioral changes
- **Privacy Infrastructure**: Data deletion capabilities support GDPR compliance with configurable email notifications
- **API Infrastructure**: Self-service API key management supports the broader Amplitude API ecosystem

## Technical Specifications and Operational Limits

**API Key Management**: 50 active key limit per organization with 6-hour deletion propagation periods

**Data Deletion Scanning**: Growth plans (1B events/month), Enterprise plans (10B events/month)

**Portfolio Project Limits**: 5-10 projects per Portfolio View depending on plan tier

**Webhook Configuration**: Available for Enterprise customers through Organization Settings

**SCIM Integration**: User Management API supports automated provisioning with identity provider integration

The system supports bulk operations including user invitation through the Members & Groups settings page, content ownership transfer, and email domain migration processes. Complex operations like project deletion and organization URL modifications require Customer Success Manager coordination or support ticket submission, maintaining enterprise-grade change control while providing self-service capabilities for routine administrative tasks.
