# Amplitude Account Management

## Product Overview

Amplitude is an analytics platform for tracking and analyzing user behavior across digital products. The account management system provides administrative tools for managing organizations, projects, users, permissions, and data within the Amplitude ecosystem.

Amplitude Account Management enables organizations to:
- Structure and organize analytics data across multiple products and teams
- Control user access with role-based permissions
- Manage data ingestion through API and secret keys
- Ensure data privacy compliance with self-service deletion tools
- Analyze user behavior across multiple projects with Portfolio views
- Automate user provisioning through SCIM integration
- Configure real-time alerts via webhooks

## Product Relationships and Features

### Organization and Project Hierarchy

Organizations serve as the top-level container within Amplitude, housing projects, users, and settings. Each organization can contain multiple projects, which represent individual products or applications being tracked.

Projects are the primary data containers that:
- Store specific product analytics data
- Have dedicated API and secret keys for data ingestion
- Maintain independent configuration settings for:
  - Session definitions (how user sessions are tracked)
  - Time zone settings (affecting how data is displayed)
  - Currency display preferences
  - Sampling rates for high-volume data collection

Organizations can implement cross-project analysis through Portfolio views, allowing teams to track user journeys across multiple products.

### User Management System

Amplitude's permission system operates on multiple levels:

1. **Organization-level roles** follow a hierarchical structure:
   - Viewer (read-only access)
   - Member (basic analysis capabilities)
   - Manager (advanced features and limited admin functions)
   - Admin (full administrative control)

2. **Project-level permissions** provide granular access control to specific projects

3. **Permission Groups** (Enterprise feature) allow administrators to:
   - Create reusable permission templates
   - Assign multiple users to standardized access levels
   - Efficiently manage permissions at scale

4. **SCIM Provisioning** enables enterprise customers to:
   - Automate user and group management via API
   - Integrate with identity providers like Okta
   - Programmatically control access and permissions

### Data Management Capabilities

Amplitude provides several tools for managing analytics data:

- **Self-service Data Deletion** allows permanent removal of:
  - Specific events
  - User properties
  - Event properties
  
- **Scale Feature** implements dynamic behavioral sampling for high-volume data, helping to:
  - Reduce costs
  - Maintain performance
  - Preserve data quality through intelligent sampling

- **User Privacy Notifications** support compliance requirements by:
  - Tracking data deletion requests
  - Providing audit trails
  - Supporting GDPR compliance workflows

### Integration Framework

Amplitude connects with other systems through:

- **API and Secret Keys** for secure data ingestion and retrieval
- **Webhooks** that trigger notifications when metrics change
- **User Mapping API** to reconcile user identities across projects
- **SCIM API** for identity management integration

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **API Key**: Unique identifier used for sending data to Amplitude
- **Secret Key**: Credential used for secure API access to retrieve data
- **Permission Groups**: Collections of users with identical access levels
- **Portfolio Views**: Enterprise feature enabling cross-project analysis by merging data
- **SCIM**: System for Cross-domain Identity Management, a standard protocol for user provisioning
- **Scale**: Feature for intelligent sampling of high-volume event data
- **Session Definition**: Configuration determining how user sessions are tracked and timed
- **User Mapping**: Process of reconciling different user identifiers across projects

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Account Management serves as the administrative foundation for the broader Amplitude Analytics platform:

1. **Cross-product Analysis**: Portfolio views enable tracking user journeys across different products and applications, providing a unified view of the customer experience.

2. **Enterprise Identity Integration**: SCIM provisioning connects Amplitude with enterprise identity providers, streamlining user management and access control.

3. **Data Privacy Framework**: Self-service deletion tools and privacy notifications ensure compliance with regulations like GDPR.

4. **Scalability Solutions**: Features like dynamic behavioral sampling help organizations manage high event volumes cost-effectively.

5. **Extended Analytics Ecosystem**: Webhooks connect Amplitude insights to other business systems, enabling automated workflows based on analytics triggers.

## API Endpoints and Commands

The documentation references several API interfaces:

- **User Privacy API**: Manages data deletion requests
- **SCIM 2.0 API**: Handles user and group provisioning
  - Endpoint: `https://amplitude.com/api/2/scim/v2`
  - Supports standard SCIM operations for users and groups
  
- **User Mapping API**: Reconciles user IDs across projects for Portfolio analysis

- **Webhook Configuration**: Custom endpoints can be configured to receive alert payloads when metrics change

API and secret key management is handled through the self-service interface with a limit of 50 active keys per project.

Organizations can configure various settings including session definitions, time zones, currency display, and sampling rates through both the UI and relevant APIs.
