# Amplitude Account Management

## Product Overview

Amplitude is an analytics platform designed to help organizations understand user behavior across digital products. The account management component provides tools for managing organizations, projects, users, permissions, data, and integrations within the Amplitude ecosystem.

Key features include:
- Organization and project management

- API and secret key management
- Data deletion capabilities
- Cross-project analysis through Portfolio
- Notification management
- Currency display customization
- Event volume management through sampling
- SCIM provisioning for enterprise user management

## Organization and Project Structure

Amplitude uses a hierarchical structure to organize analytics data:

- **Organizations** are the top-level entities that contain projects and users. They represent the company or business entity using Amplitude.
- **Projects** store specific product data and have configurable settings including:
  - API keys for data collection
  - Session definitions
  - Time zones
  - Sampling rates
- **Portfolio Views** (Enterprise feature) enable cross-project analysis by merging data from up to 5-10 projects, allowing organizations to track user journeys across multiple products.

## User Management and Permissions

Amplitude implements a role-based access control system:

- **User Roles** follow a hierarchical structure:
  - **Viewers**: Can access dashboards and create undiscoverable (private) content
  - **Members**: Can create discoverable content visible to others
  - **Managers**: Can manage users and content
  - **Admins**: Have full control over organization settings

- **Permission Groups** (Enterprise feature) allow efficient management of user permissions at scale, grouping users with similar access needs.

- **SCIM Provisioning** (Enterprise feature) enables programmatic user and group management through SCIM 2.0 API, integrating with identity providers like Okta.

## Data Management Features

- **Self-Service Data Deletion** allows administrators to permanently remove specific events or properties, supporting compliance requirements.

- **Dynamic Behavioral Sampling** (Scale feature for Enterprise) manages high event volumes by intelligently sampling events based on user identity, preserving complete user behavior streams while reducing data volume.

- **API and Secret Keys** are managed through a self-service key management page, with limits of 50 active keys per organization and a 6-hour deletion period for revoked keys.

## Integration and Notification Features

- **Webhooks** enable real-time integration with other applications when KPIs change, supporting custom HTTP headers and authentication.

- **User Privacy Notifications** allow control of GDPR-related email notifications.

- **Currency Display** can be customized for revenue visualization across the platform.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **API Key**: Unique identifier used to authenticate API requests to Amplitude
- **Secret Key**: Secure key used for sensitive operations like data deletion
- **Permission Groups**: Collections of users with the same access levels to specific projects
- **Portfolio Views**: Cross-project analysis tools that merge data from multiple projects
- **SCIM**: System for Cross-domain Identity Management, a standard for automating user provisioning
- **Dynamic Behavioral Sampling**: Method to sample events while preserving complete user behavior streams
- **Session Definition**: Configuration that determines how user sessions are tracked and measured
- **Webhooks**: HTTP callbacks that deliver data to other applications when events occur
- **Discoverable Content**: Dashboards and charts visible to all users with appropriate permissions
- **Undiscoverable Content**: Private dashboards only visible to creators and specific users
