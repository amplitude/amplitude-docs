Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics platform that provides organizations with behavioral analytics, user tracking, and data management capabilities. The platform serves businesses ranging from Growth to Enterprise tiers, offering sophisticated user behavior analysis, cross-project insights, and robust administrative controls for managing large-scale analytics implementations.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

The Amplitude ecosystem centers around a hierarchical structure of Organizations containing multiple Projects, with Portfolio functionality enabling cross-project analysis for Enterprise customers. The platform integrates several core components:

**Analytics Core**: Projects serve as the fundamental unit for data collection and analysis, each with dedicated API keys, secret keys, and configuration settings including session definitions, time zones, and currency display units. The Scale feature provides dynamic behavioral sampling for ultra-high volume Enterprise customers, managing costs while maintaining analysis accuracy through algorithmic sampling frameworks.

**User Management System**: A comprehensive role-based access control system spans from Viewer to Admin levels, with Enterprise customers accessing permission groups for bulk user management. The system integrates with SCIM 2.0 provisioning through identity providers like Okta, supporting automated user lifecycle management.

**Data Governance**: Self-service data deletion capabilities allow administrators to permanently remove specific events and properties, with scanning limits of 1B events/month for Growth plans and 10B events/month for Enterprise. The platform includes GDPR compliance features with configurable privacy notifications for data deletion requests.

**Monitoring and Integration**: Webhooks enable real-time notifications for custom monitors, automatically triggering external endpoints when KPI-affecting behavioral changes occur.
