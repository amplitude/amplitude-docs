Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics platform that provides organizations with behavioral data analysis capabilities through a multi-tiered architecture of organizations, projects, and user management systems. The platform serves businesses ranging from Growth to Enterprise plans, offering sophisticated event tracking, user behavior analysis, and data management tools for understanding customer journeys and product performance.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The platform operates on a hierarchical structure where **Organizations** serve as the top-level container, housing multiple **Projects** that represent individual products or applications. Each project maintains its own API keys, secret keys, session definitions, time zones, and currency display settings. Projects can be analyzed individually or combined through the **Portfolio** feature (Enterprise only), which creates Views that merge up to 5 projects for cross-product user journey analysis.

User management operates at both organizational and project levels, with **Permission Groups** (Enterprise) enabling bulk assignment of project permissions. The platform integrates with identity providers through **SSO configuration** and **SCIM 2.0 provisioning**, supporting automated user and group management via the **User Management API**.

Data collection and processing features include **Session Replay** with configurable sample rates, **dynamic behavioral sampling** through the Scale feature for high-volume customers, and comprehensive **event volume management**. The platform maintains data integrity while providing cost management through algorithmic sampling frameworks that preserve complete user event streams.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**User Roles** follow a four-tier hierarchy: **Viewer** (read-only access), **Member** (basic content creation), **Manager** (advanced features and some admin functions), and **Admin** (full organizational control). **Project-level permissions** allow granular access control for Enterprise customers.

**API Keys and Secret Keys** authenticate data ingestion and API access, with Enterprise organizations having self-service key management capabilities and a 50 active key limit. **SCIM Keys** enable identity provider integration for automated provisioning.

**Views** in Portfolio represent merged project data sources, while **Team Spaces** organize content and users within projects. **Behavioral Cohorts** and **Custom Events** represent user segmentation and tracking capabilities.

**Dynamic Behavioral Sampling** uses user identity-based sampling with **upsampling metrics** to maintain analysis accuracy while managing costs. **Session Definitions** determine user session boundaries, while **Query Time Sampling** affects analysis performance.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates extensively with external systems through multiple touchpoints. **Slack integration** enables notification delivery and team collaboration. **Identity providers** connect via SSO and SCIM for enterprise user management. **Webhooks** (Enterprise) send real-time notifications to external endpoints when custom monitors detect KPI-affecting behavior changes.

The **User Mapping API** enables cross-project user identification in Portfolio Views, while the **User Privacy API** handles GDPR and CCPA compliance through automated data deletion workflows. **Revenue LTV charts**, **Event Segmentation**, and **Data Tables** provide analytics visualization with configurable currency display units.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

Key API integrations include:
- **User Management API** for programmatic user and group management
- **SCIM API** for identity provider provisioning
- **User Privacy API** for compliance and data deletion
- **User Mapping API** for cross-project user aliasing

The platform supports **SDK implementation** for event tracking and Session Replay capture. **Webhook URLs** can be configured for custom monitor notifications, with test message capabilities for endpoint validation.

Administrative functions include **CSV export settings**, **usage reports dashboard**, and **notification preferences** for various event types including Job Creation, Job Completion, and Unset Violation notifications. The system maintains **scanning limits** of 1B events/month for Growth plans and 10B events/month for Enterprise plans for data deletion operations.

Content management features include **bulk transfer ownership**, **discoverable vs undiscoverable content** settings, and **Visual Labeling** capabilities. The platform supports **derived properties**, **Guides and Surveys**, and **custom monitors** for comprehensive product analytics and user engagement tracking.
