Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics platform that provides organizations with behavioral data analysis capabilities through a multi-tiered account management system. The platform operates on a hierarchical structure with organizations containing multiple projects, where each project represents a distinct data collection and analysis environment with its own API keys, event tracking, and user segmentation capabilities.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The platform's core architecture centers around **Organizations** as the top-level entity, containing multiple **Projects** that serve as isolated data environments. Each project maintains its own API keys, secret keys, session definitions, time zones, and currency display settings. The **Portfolio** feature enables Enterprise customers to perform cross-project analysis by creating Views that merge up to 5 projects (expandable to 10) using user ID/device ID matching and the User Mapping API for aliasing different user identifiers.

User management operates through a sophisticated **role-based permission system** with four hierarchical levels: Viewer, Member, Manager, and Admin. These roles control access to organization-level settings, project-level configurations, content creation capabilities, and administrative functions. **Permission Groups** (Enterprise-only) enable bulk user management by assigning project permissions to multiple users simultaneously, with the system automatically granting the highest permission level when users have overlapping assignments.

Data management features include **Scale** (dynamic behavioral sampling for Enterprise plans) which samples events based on user identity to manage costs while maintaining analysis accuracy through upsampling metrics. The **self-service data deletion** capability allows Growth and Enterprise administrators to permanently remove specific events and properties, with scanning limits of 1B events/month for Growth and 10B events/month for Enterprise plans.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**API Keys and Secret Keys**: Project-specific authentication credentials managed through self-service interfaces, with support for up to 50 active keys per project and permanent key operations including creation, revocation, and deletion.

**SCIM 2.0 Provisioning**: System for Cross-domain Identity Management integration using the User Management API, supporting programmatic user and group management with identity providers like Okta.

**Session Replay**: Capture functionality with configurable sample rates and SDK implementation requirements, managed through organizational settings.

**Dynamic Behavioral Sampling**: The Scale feature's algorithmic framework that samples events based on user identity while preserving complete user event streams and providing upsampling metrics for analysis accuracy.

**Views**: Portfolio feature components that merge multiple projects into unified displays for cross-project analysis.

**Webhooks**: Custom monitor integration endpoints that automatically send triggered notifications when KPI-affecting user behavior changes occur (Enterprise Insights package).

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates with external systems through multiple touchpoints. **SSO configuration** enables identity provider integration for user authentication, while **SCIM provisioning** facilitates automated user lifecycle management. The platform supports **Slack integration** for notifications and collaborative workflows, and provides **webhook endpoints** for real-time monitor notifications to external systems.

The **User Privacy API** handles GDPR and CCPA compliance through automated data deletion workflows, with configurable email notifications for Job Creation, Job Completion, and Unset Violation events. **Session Replay** functionality integrates with SDK implementations to capture user interactions with configurable sampling rates.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

Key API components include:

- **User Management API**: Handles SCIM 2.0 provisioning, user lifecycle management, and permission group operations
- **User Privacy API**: Manages data deletion requests and privacy compliance workflows  
- **User Mapping API**: Enables cross-project user identity aliasing for Portfolio Views
- **Webhook endpoints**: Custom monitor integration for real-time notifications

The platform supports **CSV export functionality**, **Revenue LTV charts**, **Event Segmentation revenue metrics**, and **Data Tables** with configurable currency display units. Administrative functions include **API key rotation**, **session definition configuration**, **query time sampling**, and **project deletion workflows** managed through CSM support tickets for organizational changes.

**Team Spaces** provide collaborative environments with inherited permissions from groups, while **Visual Labeling**, **Guides and Surveys**, and **behavioral cohorts** offer advanced analysis and user engagement capabilities restricted by role-based permissions.
