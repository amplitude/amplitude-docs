Amplitude's Account Management system is a comprehensive organizational and project administration platform that provides hierarchical control over analytics implementations across different subscription tiers. The system operates on a multi-tiered architecture where organizations serve as top-level containers housing multiple projects, with users assigned role-based permissions that govern their access levels and administrative capabilities.

## Core Architecture and Product Relationships

The account management system centers around a hierarchical organizational structure accessible through the Settings page, which functions as the primary administrative control hub. Organizations contain multiple projects, each representing individual analytics implementations with dedicated API keys, secret keys, and configuration settings including time zones, currency display units, and session definitions.

The system integrates deeply with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem through several key touchpoints. Projects serve as data containers for analytics implementations, while the Portfolio feature enables Enterprise customers to create Views that merge up to 5 projects (or 10 with approval) for cross-project analysis using user ID/device ID matching and the User Mapping API for identity aliasing. Integration extends to Amplitude Experiment through app-level permissions, Session Replay with project-level configuration controls, and external systems through Slack integration and identity provider connections.

## User Management and Access Control

The platform implements a four-tier role-based access control system with distinct permission levels. Viewers maintain read-only access to discoverable content, Members can create and edit their own content, Managers possess additional administrative capabilities including user management functions, and Admins have comprehensive organizational control encompassing billing and advanced configuration settings.

Enterprise customers benefit from enhanced access control through Permission Groups, which enable bulk assignment of project permissions to multiple users, and project-level permission management. The system supports automated user lifecycle management through SCIM 2.0 provisioning integration with identity providers like Okta, complemented by SSO capabilities for seamless authentication workflows.

## Key Features and Capabilities

Project management capabilities include comprehensive API key and secret key rotation with self-service management allowing Managers and Admins to create, revoke, and delete up to 50 active keys per organization. Billing and usage monitoring provides visibility into MTU (Monthly Tracked Users) and event limits, while Session Replay configuration offers sample rate controls at the project level.

Enterprise-tier features include Portfolio for cross-project analysis, SCIM 2.0 provisioning for automated user management, Permission Groups for bulk access control, and the Scale feature implementing Dynamic Behavioral Sampling to manage ultra-high volume event processing through user identity-based sampling while maintaining analysis accuracy via upsampling metrics.

## Technical Implementation and API Integration

The system exposes several key API endpoints for programmatic management. The **User Management API** enables automated user lifecycle operations, while the **SCIM API** facilitates identity provider integration. The **User Privacy API** supports GDPR and CCPA compliance through automated data deletion workflows, and the **User Mapping API** enables Portfolio cross-project user aliasing functionality.

Data management capabilities include self-service permanent removal of specific events and properties, with scanning limits of 1B events/month for Growth plans and 10B events/month for Enterprise plans. The system maintains comprehensive audit trails and provides notification workflows for privacy regulation compliance, including Job Creation, Job Completion, and Unset Violation notifications.

## Advanced Enterprise Features

Enterprise customers access sophisticated monitoring and integration capabilities through webhook configurations for custom monitors, enabling triggered notifications to external endpoints when KPI-affecting behavioral changes occur. The Scale feature provides Dynamic Behavioral Sampling that intelligently samples events based on user identity while preserving analytical accuracy through statistical upsampling techniques.

The Portfolio feature represents a significant capability for Enterprise customers, allowing creation of unified Views across multiple projects through sophisticated user matching algorithms and the User Mapping API for identity resolution across disparate data sources.
