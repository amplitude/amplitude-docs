# Amplitude Account Management

## Product Overview

Amplitude is an analytics platform for tracking and analyzing user behavior across digital products. The account management system provides comprehensive administration tools for organizations, projects, users, permissions, and data. The platform enables organizations to gain insights into user behavior, manage access controls, ensure data privacy compliance, perform cross-project analysis, and integrate with external systems.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Organization and Project Structure

Amplitude uses a hierarchical structure to organize data and manage access:

- **Organizations**: The top-level entity containing all projects and users
- **Projects**: Individual data repositories tracking specific products or applications
- **Portfolio Views**: An Enterprise-tier feature allowing cross-project analysis by merging data from multiple projects (limited to 5-10 projects)

### User Management and Permissions

Amplitude implements a sophisticated permission system:

- **User Roles**: Four hierarchical permission levels:
  - **Viewer**: Access to dashboards and creation of undiscoverable content
  - **Member**: Creation of discoverable content
  - **Manager**: User and content management capabilities
  - **Admin**: Full control over organization settings
- **Permission Groups**: Enterprise feature for managing permissions at scale by grouping users with specific access levels
- **SCIM Provisioning**: Enterprise feature for programmatic user/group management via SCIM 2.0 standard API

### Data Management

- **Dynamic Behavioral Sampling (Scale)**: Enterprise feature for managing high event volumes through identity-based sampling while preserving complete user behavior streams
- **Self-Service Data Deletion**: Allows Growth and Enterprise administrators to permanently remove specific events or properties
- **Currency Unit Configuration**: Customizable display currency for revenue metrics

### Integration and Automation

- **API and Secret Keys**: Self-service management for authentication credentials
- **Webhooks**: Enterprise feature for sending automated notifications to external endpoints when KPIs change
- **User Privacy Notifications**: Controls for GDPR-related email notifications
