## Product Relationships and Features

### Organization and Project Structure
Amplitude uses a hierarchical structure to organize analytics data:
- **Organizations** serve as the top-level entities containing multiple projects
- **Projects** store specific product data with dedicated settings, API keys, and user permissions
- **Portfolio Views** (Enterprise feature) enable cross-project analysis by merging data from up to 5-10 projects

### User Management and Permissions
Amplitude provides several mechanisms for controlling access:
- **User Roles** follow a hierarchical structure: Viewer → Member → Manager → Admin
- **Permission Groups** (Enterprise feature) allow efficient management of permissions at scale
- **Project-level Permissions** provide granular access control to specific projects
- **SCIM Provisioning** enables programmatic user and group management through standardized API

### Data Management
Administrators have tools to manage data within Amplitude:
- **Self-service Data Deletion** allows administrators to permanently remove specific events or properties
- **API and Secret Keys** control programmatic access to project data
- **Scale** (Enterprise feature) provides dynamic behavioral sampling to manage high event volumes

### Integration and Notification
Amplitude connects with other systems through:
- **Webhooks** for sending automated messages when KPIs change
