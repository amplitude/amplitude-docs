# Amplitude Account Management System

Amplitude's Account Management system serves as the foundational administrative layer for the analytics platform, providing comprehensive organizational governance, user access control, and data management capabilities across enterprise-scale deployments.

## Product Overview and Core Architecture

The system operates on a three-tier hierarchical structure: **Organizations** → **Projects** → **Portfolio Views**. Organizations function as the top-level administrative boundary, housing multiple projects that contain analytics data and configurations. Each organization centralizes billing management, SSO integration, cross-project features, and enterprise-wide user administration.

Projects serve as data collection containers with independent configurations for API authentication, session definitions, time zones, sampling parameters, and privacy controls. The **Portfolio** capability extends this architecture by enabling Enterprise customers to create unified **Views** that aggregate data from up to 5 projects (expandable to 10), utilizing user ID/device ID matching and the User Mapping API for cross-project identity resolution.

## User Management and Access Control

The platform implements a granular four-tier permission model:
- **Viewer**: Read-only access to analytics content
- **Member**: Content creation and basic data interaction
- **Manager**: Data source management and advanced configurations  
- **Admin**: Full administrative capabilities including user management

**Permission Groups** (Enterprise-only) enable scalable access management by allowing bulk assignment of project-level permissions to user cohorts. When users belong to multiple groups, the system automatically grants the highest available permission level.

User provisioning integrates with enterprise identity systems through **SCIM 2.0** protocol support, including native Okta integration. The system supports standard schema fields (userName, givenName, familyName, email, active) and provides programmatic user lifecycle management through the User Management API.

## Data Governance and Privacy Controls

**Scale** functionality provides intelligent data sampling at the user identity level, enabling organizations to manage data volume while maintaining analytical accuracy. The system supports configurable sampling rates, user property inclusion lists for exempting critical user segments, and upsampling calculations with accuracy benchmarks across different DAU volumes.

**Self-Service Data Deletion** capabilities allow Growth and Enterprise administrators to permanently remove specific events and properties through a task-based interface. The system enforces scanning limits of 1B events/month (Growth) and 10B events/month (Enterprise), with comprehensive GDPR/privacy compliance workflows including configurable email notifications for Job Creation, Job Completion, and Unset Violation events.

## API Management and Security

Enterprise organizations access comprehensive **self-service key management** through Organization Settings, enabling Managers and Admins to create, revoke, and delete API keys and secret keys. The system supports up to 50 active keys with 6-hour deletion propagation and includes Key ID identifiers for enhanced security protocols.

**Webhooks** provide real-time integration capabilities, allowing Enterprise customers to configure custom monitor notifications that automatically transmit triggered alerts to external endpoints when behavioral KPI thresholds are exceeded.

## Key Configuration Domains

**Session Replay Settings** include sample rate controls and SDK implementation toggles for user behavior capture. **Currency Display Units** can be configured at the project level, affecting Revenue LTV charts, Event Segmentation metrics, and Data Tables presentation without modifying underlying data values.

**Project Settings** encompass comprehensive configuration management including API key/secret key rotation, session definition parameters, query time sampling, time zone settings, and user download permissions. Complex operations like project deletion and organization name/URL changes require CSM or support ticket workflows.

## Core API Endpoints and Integration Points

- **User Management API**: SCIM provisioning and permission group administration
- **User Privacy API**: Data deletion request processing and compliance workflows
- **User Mapping API**: Portfolio cross-project user identity aliasing
- **Organization Settings Interface**: Administrative function management
- **Members & Groups Settings**: User lifecycle and permission management
- **Project Settings**: Project-level configuration management

The system provides native integration with external identity providers through SSO configuration and supports Slack integration for notification delivery and collaborative workflows, creating a comprehensive enterprise analytics administration platform.
