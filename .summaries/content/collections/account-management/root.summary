- Organization and project hierarchy management
- Granular user permission controls and role-based access
- API and secret key management for secure programmatic access
- Advanced data management including sampling and deletion capabilities
- Cross-project analysis through Portfolio views
- Integration capabilities via webhooks and SCIM provisioning
- Privacy compliance through notification management
- Customization options for currency display and user preferences

## Product Relationships and Features

### Organization and Project Structure
Organizations serve as the top-level containers within Amplitude, housing projects, users, and configuration settings. Projects are discrete data repositories for specific products or applications. For Enterprise customers, Portfolio Views enable cross-project analysis by merging data from up to 5-10 projects, allowing for holistic analysis across multiple data sources.

### User Management and Permissions
Amplitude implements a hierarchical role system:
- **Viewer**: Basic read-only access
- **Member**: Standard analytical capabilities
- **Manager**: Advanced management functions
- **Admin**: Full administrative control

Enterprise customers gain access to Permission Groups for efficient permission management at scale, and project-level permissions for granular access control. SCIM Provisioning (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) enables automated user and group management through the SCIM 2.0 API, integrating with identity providers like Okta.

### Data Management
Scale customers can leverage Dynamic Behavioral Sampling to manage high event volumes while preserving complete user behavior streams. Self-service Data Deletion allows permanent removal of specific events or properties, with User Privacy Notifications to manage GDPR-related communications for data deletion requests. API and Secret Keys control programmatic access to Amplitude data with appropriate security measures.

### Integration and Automation
Webhooks enable real-time integration with external applications when KPIs change, allowing for automated workflows. The User Mapping API supports reconciling different user IDs across projects in Portfolio views, while the SCIM API facilitates user provisioning through identity provider integration.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **API Key**: Authentication credential for accessing Amplitude's APIs
- **Secret Key**: Secure credential used for sensitive operations
- **Permission Groups**: Collections of users with identical access levels
- **Portfolio Views**: Configurations that merge data from multiple projects for cross-project analysis
- **Dynamic Behavioral Sampling**: Intelligent sampling method that preserves complete user behavior streams while reducing data volume
- **SCIM**: Standard protocol for automating user provisioning across systems
- **Deletion Task**: Configuration for permanently removing specific events or properties
- **Session Definition**: Parameters that determine how user sessions are calculated
- **User Property Inclusion List**: Properties preserved during sampling operations

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Account Management serves as the administrative foundation for the broader Amplitude product suite:

- It controls access to **Amplitude Analytics**, the core platform for event data storage and analysis
- Integrates with **Team Spaces** through permission groups for collaborative analysis
- Provides configuration options for **Session Replay** features
- Manages access to advanced features in the **Insights Package** like webhooks
- Connects with the **User Privacy API** for GDPR compliance and data deletion workflows

The account management system effectively functions as the control center for all Amplitude products, managing access permissions, configurations, and integration points throughout the platform.
