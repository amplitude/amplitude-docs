# Summary
This documentation explains how to use permission groups in Amplitude Enterprise to efficiently manage user permissions at scale by assigning multiple users to groups with specific project access levels, rather than configuring permissions individually. The system grants users the highest permission level when they belong to multiple groups or have individual permissions.
