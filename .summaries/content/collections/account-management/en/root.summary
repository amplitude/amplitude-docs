Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics platform that provides organizations with tools to track, analyze, and act on user behavior data. The platform offers sophisticated account management capabilities designed to support enterprise-scale deployments with granular access controls, data governance features, and flexible organizational structures.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The platform operates on a hierarchical organizational model where **Organizations** contain multiple **Projects**, each representing distinct applications or data sources. This structure enables cross-project analysis through the **Portfolio** feature, which creates unified **Views** that merge up to 5-10 projects for comprehensive behavioral analysis using user ID/device ID matching and the User Mapping API for identity resolution.

The account management system integrates tightly with Amplitude's core analytics capabilities. **Session Replay** settings control behavioral data capture with configurable sample rates, while the **Scale** feature provides dynamic behavioral sampling for ultra-high volume Enterprise customers, maintaining analysis accuracy through algorithmic upsampling while managing costs. Revenue analytics are supported through configurable **currency display units** that affect Revenue LTV charts, Event Segmentation metrics, and Data Tables without modifying underlying data values.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**User Roles and Permissions**: The platform implements a four-tier role hierarchy - **Viewer** (read-only access), **Member** (content creation), **Manager** (project administration), and **Admin** (organization-wide control). **Permission Groups** on Enterprise plans enable bulk assignment of project permissions to multiple users simultaneously, with the system granting the highest permission level when users have overlapping assignments.

**API Infrastructure**: The system distinguishes between **API keys** (for data ingestion) and **Secret keys** (for data export/analysis), with self-service key management supporting up to 50 active keys per project. The platform also supports **SCIM keys** for identity provider integration and provisioning workflows.

**Data Management**: **Self-service data deletion** enables permanent removal of events and properties through a task-based queue system, with scanning limits of 1B events/month (Growth) or 10B events/month (Enterprise). The system supports **GDPR compliance** through automated user privacy notifications for data deletion requests.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The account management layer serves as the foundation for Amplitude's analytics ecosystem, integrating with multiple product areas:

**Identity and Access Management**: SCIM 2.0 provisioning enables integration with identity providers like Okta, supporting automated user/group management through the User Management API. SSO configuration provides seamless authentication workflows for enterprise deployments.

**Data Infrastructure**: The Dashboard Rest API and HTTP API enable programmatic access to analytics data, while webhook configurations allow real-time notifications for custom monitors and KPI changes. The platform supports both behavioral cohorts and custom events with role-based access controls.

**Analytics and Insights**: Team Spaces provide collaborative workspaces with inherited permissions, while Visual Labeling and derived properties enable enhanced data analysis. The Enterprise Insights package includes advanced monitoring capabilities with webhook integrations for automated alerting.

## API Endpoints and Technical Integration

Key technical interfaces include:

- **User Management API**: Programmatic user and group management with SCIM 2.0 support
- **User Privacy API**: Automated data deletion request processing
- **User Mapping API**: Cross-project identity resolution for Portfolio views
- **Dashboard Rest API/HTTP API**: Analytics data access and manipulation
- **Webhook endpoints**: Real-time monitor notifications and custom integrations

The platform supports SDK implementation for Session Replay capture, with configurable sample rates and user privacy controls. Currency conversion and time zone settings are managed at the project level, affecting dashboard formatting and notebook visualizations without modifying underlying data integrity.

This comprehensive account management system enables organizations to scale their analytics operations while maintaining data governance, security, and compliance requirements across complex multi-project deployments.
