Amplitude's Account Management system provides comprehensive organizational and project administration capabilities for managing analytics implementations across different plan tiers. The platform operates on a hierarchical structure with organizations containing multiple projects, where users are assigned specific roles (Viewer, Member, Manager, Admin) that determine their access levels and administrative capabilities.

## Core Features and Capabilities

The account management system centers around organizational settings accessible through the Settings page, which serves as the primary control hub for both organizational and project-level configurations. Key features include project management with API key and secret key rotation, user permission management through role-based access control, billing and usage monitoring with MTU (Monthly Tracked Users) and event limits, and Session Replay configuration with sample rate controls.

For Enterprise customers, advanced features include Portfolio for cross-project analysis, SCIM 2.0 provisioning for automated user management, permission groups for bulk access control, and the Scale feature for dynamic behavioral sampling to manage ultra-high volume event processing.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The account management system integrates tightly with Amplitude's broader analytics platform. Projects serve as containers for analytics data, each with dedicated API keys, secret keys, and configuration settings including time zones, currency display units, and session definitions. The Portfolio feature enables Enterprise customers to create Views that merge up to 5 projects (or 10 with approval) for cross-project analysis using user ID/device ID matching and the User Mapping API for aliasing.

User management operates at both organizational and project levels, with Enterprise customers having access to project-level permissions and permission groups. The system integrates with identity providers through SSO and SCIM provisioning, supporting automated user lifecycle management through the User Management API.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Organizations** represent the top-level entity containing multiple projects and users. **Projects** are individual analytics implementations with unique API keys, secret keys, and configuration settings. **Views** in Portfolio context refer to merged displays of multiple projects for cross-project analysis.

**User Roles** follow a hierarchical structure: Viewers have read-only access to discoverable content, Members can create and edit their own content, Managers have additional administrative capabilities including user management, and Admins have full organizational control including billing and advanced settings.

**Permission Groups** (Enterprise only) allow bulk assignment of project permissions to multiple users. **Dynamic Behavioral Sampling** through the Scale feature samples events based on user identity while maintaining analysis accuracy through upsampling metrics.

## Ecosystem Integration

The account management system integrates with multiple Amplitude products and external systems. It connects with Amplitude Experiment through app-level permissions, supports Slack integration for notifications and collaboration, and integrates with identity providers like Okta through SCIM 2.0 provisioning.

The User Management API and SCIM API enable programmatic user and group management, while the User Privacy API supports GDPR and CCPA compliance through automated data deletion workflows. Session Replay integration allows configuration of capture settings and sample rates at the project level.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

Key API integrations include the **User Management API** for programmatic user lifecycle management, **SCIM API** for identity provider integration, **User Privacy API** for data deletion requests, and **User Mapping API** for Portfolio cross-project user aliasing.

The system supports webhook configurations for custom monitors, allowing Enterprise customers to send triggered monitor notifications to external endpoints when KPI-affecting behavior changes occur. Self-service key management enables Managers and Admins to create, revoke, and delete API keys and secret keys through the Organization Settings interface, with a limit of 50 active keys per organization.

Data deletion capabilities include self-service permanent removal of specific events and properties, with scanning limits of 1B events/month for Growth plans and 10B events/month for Enterprise plans. The system maintains audit trails and provides notification workflows for privacy regulation compliance, including Job Creation, Job Completion, and Unset Violation notifications.
