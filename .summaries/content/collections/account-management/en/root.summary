Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics platform that provides organizations with behavioral analytics, user tracking, and data management capabilities. The platform operates on a hierarchical structure with organizations containing multiple projects, where each project represents a distinct data collection and analysis environment with its own API keys, user permissions, and configuration settings.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The platform centers around a multi-tiered organizational structure where **Organizations** serve as the top-level container for **Projects**. Each project maintains independent data streams, API configurations, and user access controls. The **Portfolio** feature enables Enterprise customers to perform cross-project analysis by creating Views that merge up to 5-10 projects using user ID/device ID matching and the User Mapping API for aliasing.

User management operates through a role-based permission system with four hierarchical levels: **Viewer** (read-only access), **Member** (content creation), **Manager** (advanced features and API access), and **Admin** (full organizational control). **Permission Groups** allow Enterprise customers to assign project permissions to multiple users simultaneously, with the system granting the highest permission level when users have overlapping assignments.

Data management features include **Scale** (dynamic behavioral sampling for high-volume Enterprise customers), **Self-Service Data Deletion** (permanent event/property removal with GDPR/CCPA compliance), and **Session Replay** settings with configurable sample rates. The platform supports **SCIM 2.0 provisioning** through the User Management API for automated user/group management and identity provider integration.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**API Keys and Secret Keys**: Project-specific authentication credentials managed through self-service interfaces, with support for up to 50 active keys per project and 6-hour deletion timeframes.

**Dynamic Behavioral Sampling**: The Scale feature's algorithmic approach to sampling events based on user identity while maintaining analysis accuracy through upsampling metrics.

**Views**: Portfolio's data source merging mechanism that combines multiple projects into unified analytical displays.

**Permission Groups**: Enterprise-only feature enabling bulk user permission management through group membership assignments.

**Webhooks**: Custom monitor notification endpoints that trigger when KPI-affecting behavioral changes occur, available to Enterprise Insights package customers.

**Session Definition**: Project-level configuration determining how user sessions are calculated and measured across the platform.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The platform integrates extensively with external systems through multiple APIs: the **Dashboard Rest API** and **HTTP API** for programmatic access, the **User Management API** for SCIM provisioning, and the **User Privacy API** for compliance-driven data operations. **SSO configuration** enables identity provider integration, while **Slack integration** provides notification and collaboration capabilities.

Revenue analytics capabilities include configurable **currency display units** affecting Revenue LTV charts, Event Segmentation metrics, and Data Tables visualization without modifying underlying data values. The platform supports **Team Spaces** for collaborative analytics and maintains **discoverable vs undiscoverable content** classifications for access control.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

Key technical interfaces include:
- **User Management API** for SCIM 2.0 provisioning and programmatic user management
- **User Privacy API** for GDPR/CCPA compliance and data deletion requests
- **Dashboard Rest API** and **HTTP API** for general platform integration
- **User Mapping API** for cross-project user aliasing in Portfolio Views
- **Webhook endpoints** for custom monitor notifications

The platform operates with specific technical constraints: Growth plans support 1B events/month scanning limits for data deletion, Enterprise plans support 10B events/month, and Portfolio Views can merge 5 projects by default (expandable to 10 with account team approval). Session Replay capture includes SDK implementation requirements and configurable sample rate controls for performance optimization.
