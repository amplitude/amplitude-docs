Amplitude's Account Management system provides comprehensive organizational and project-level administration capabilities for managing users, permissions, data, and integrations across the analytics platform. The system operates on a hierarchical permission model with four distinct user roles (Viewer, Member, Manager, Admin) that control access to various features and administrative functions.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The account management system centers around Organizations that contain multiple Projects, with permissions and settings managed at both levels. Organizations serve as the top-level container for billing, SSO configuration, user management, and cross-project features like Portfolio views. Projects contain the actual analytics data and have their own API keys, session definitions, time zones, and currency settings.

Permission Groups provide Enterprise customers with scalable user management by allowing bulk assignment of project permissions to multiple users simultaneously. The system grants users the highest permission level when they have multiple conflicting assignments across different groups or direct assignments.

Portfolio functionality enables Enterprise customers to perform cross-project analysis by creating Views that merge up to 5 projects (or 10 with approval) into unified displays, using user ID/device ID matching and optional User Mapping API for aliasing different identifiers across projects.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**User Roles**: Viewer (read-only access), Member (content creation), Manager (project administration), Admin (organization-wide control including billing and user management)

**API Keys and Secret Keys**: Authentication credentials for programmatic access, with Enterprise customers having self-service management capabilities and a 50 active key limit per organization

**Dynamic Behavioral Sampling (Scale)**: Enterprise feature that samples events based on user identity to manage costs for high-volume customers while maintaining analysis accuracy through upsampling metrics

**SCIM Provisioning**: SCIM 2.0 integration for automated user and group management through identity providers like Okta, using the User Management API

**Session Replay Settings**: Organizational controls for capturing user sessions with configurable sample rates and privacy controls

## Data Management and Privacy Features

The platform includes comprehensive data deletion capabilities through self-service interfaces that allow permanent removal of specific events and properties. Growth plans support scanning up to 1B events/month while Enterprise plans support 10B events/month. The system provides GDPR and privacy regulation compliance through automated notification workflows for data deletion requests.

Currency display units can be configured at the project level, affecting Revenue LTV charts, Event Segmentation metrics, and Data Tables without modifying underlying data values. Time zone and session definition settings are also configurable per project.

## Integration and API Capabilities

The system exposes several API endpoints and management interfaces:

- **User Management API**: Programmatic user and group management with SCIM 2.0 support
- **User Privacy API**: Automated data deletion request processing
- **User Mapping API**: Cross-project user identity aliasing for Portfolio views
- **Webhooks**: Custom monitor notifications for Enterprise customers when KPI-affecting behavior changes occur

Administrative functions are accessible through Organization Settings, including Members & Groups management, API key rotation, SSO configuration, and project settings. The platform supports Slack integration for notifications and provides customizable themes and notification preferences at the user level.

The account management system integrates with broader Amplitude features like Team Spaces, Visual Labeling, Guides and Surveys, and behavioral cohorts, with permission controls determining user access to these capabilities based on their assigned roles and group memberships.
