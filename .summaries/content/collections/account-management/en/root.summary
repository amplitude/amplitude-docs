Amplitude's Account Management system provides comprehensive organizational and project-level administration capabilities for the analytics platform. The system operates on a hierarchical structure with organizations containing multiple projects, each with configurable settings, user permissions, and data management controls.

## Core Product Architecture

The account management system centers around **Organizations** as the top-level entity, containing multiple **Projects** that house analytics data. Each organization maintains centralized settings for billing, user management, SSO configuration, and cross-project features, while projects contain specific configurations for API keys, session definitions, time zones, and data collection parameters.

**Portfolio** functionality enables Enterprise customers to create **Views** that merge up to 5 projects (expandable to 10) for cross-project analysis, using user ID/device ID matching and the User Mapping API for aliasing different user identifiers across projects.

## User Management and Permissions

The platform implements a four-tier role hierarchy: **Viewer**, **Member**, **Manager**, and **Admin**, with escalating permissions for content creation, data source management, and administrative capabilities. **Permission Groups** (Enterprise-only) enable bulk assignment of project permissions to multiple users simultaneously, with the system granting users the highest permission level when they belong to multiple groups.

User provisioning supports **SCIM 2.0** integration through the User Management API, with Okta integration and support for standard schema fields (userName, givenName, familyName, email, active). The Members & Groups settings page provides interfaces for user invitations, project-level permission management, and content ownership transfers.

## Data Management and Privacy

**Scale** (Enterprise feature) provides dynamic behavioral sampling at the user identity level, with configurable sampling rates, user property inclusion lists for exempting key populations, and upsampling calculations with accuracy benchmarks across different DAU volumes.

The **Self-Service Data Deletion** feature allows Growth and Enterprise administrators to permanently delete specific events and properties through a task-based interface, with scanning limits of 1B events/month (Growth) and 10B events/month (Enterprise). The system includes GDPR/privacy compliance notifications for data deletion requests with configurable email alerts (Job Creation, Job Completion, Unset Violation).

## API and Integration Management

Enterprise organizations access **self-service key management** through Organization Settings, enabling Managers and Admins to create, revoke, and delete API keys and secret keys. The system supports up to 50 active keys with 6-hour deletion propagation and permanent revocation processes. Secret keys include Key ID identifiers for enhanced security.

**Webhooks** enable Enterprise customers to configure custom monitor notifications, automatically sending triggered alerts to external endpoints when KPI-related behavioral changes occur.

## Key Configuration Areas

**Session Replay Settings** include sample rate controls and SDK implementation toggles. **Currency Display Units** can be configured at the project level, affecting Revenue LTV charts, Event Segmentation metrics, and Data Tables without modifying underlying data values.

**Project Settings** encompass API key/secret key rotation, session definition configuration, query time sampling, time zone settings, and user download features. Project deletion workflows and organization name/URL changes require CSM or support requests.

## Core API Endpoints and Interfaces

- User Management API for SCIM provisioning and permission groups
- User Privacy API for data deletion requests  
- User Mapping API for Portfolio cross-project user aliasing
- Organization Settings interface for administrative functions
- Members & Groups settings page for user management
- Projects settings for project-level configurations

The system integrates with external identity providers through SSO configuration and supports Slack integration for notifications and collaboration workflows.
