Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics platform that provides organizations with behavioral analytics, user tracking, and data management capabilities. The platform serves businesses ranging from Growth to Enterprise tiers, offering sophisticated user behavior analysis, cross-project insights, and robust administrative controls for managing large-scale analytics implementations.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

The Amplitude ecosystem centers around a hierarchical organizational structure where **Organizations** contain multiple **Projects**, each representing distinct product analytics implementations. Projects serve as the primary data containers, housing events, user properties, and behavioral data streams that feed into various analytics modules including Event Segmentation, Revenue LTV charts, and Data Tables.

**Portfolio** functionality enables Enterprise customers to perform cross-project analysis by creating **Views** that merge up to 5 projects (expandable to 10 with approval) into unified displays. This cross-project capability leverages user ID/device ID matching and the **User Mapping API** for aliasing different user identifiers across project boundaries.

The platform integrates **Session Replay** capabilities directly into organizational settings, allowing administrators to configure sample rates and manage session capture toggles at the project level. **Scale** feature provides dynamic behavioral sampling for ultra-high volume Enterprise customers, implementing algorithmic sampling based on user identity while maintaining analysis accuracy through upsampling metrics.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Organizations** represent the top-level administrative boundary containing projects, users, and billing configurations. **Projects** are individual analytics implementations with dedicated API keys, secret keys, and data streams. **Views** are Portfolio-created merged displays of multiple projects for cross-project analysis.

**Permission Groups** (Enterprise-only) enable bulk user permission management across projects, with the system granting the highest permission level when users have multiple assignments. **Team Spaces** provide collaborative workspaces for sharing analytics content and insights.

**Dynamic Behavioral Sampling** refers to the Scale feature's algorithmic approach to managing event volume by sampling based on user identity rather than random event selection. **User Mapping API** enables aliasing different user IDs across projects for unified cross-project user journey analysis.

**SCIM 2.0 Provisioning** provides programmatic user and group management through identity provider integration, supporting automated user lifecycle management for Enterprise customers.

## User Roles and Access Control

Amplitude implements a four-tier role hierarchy: **Viewer** (read-only access), **Member** (content creation), **Manager** (project administration), and **Admin** (organization-wide control). Enterprise customers can implement **project-level permissions** for granular access control across different analytics implementations.

**Permission Groups** allow Enterprise administrators to assign project permissions to multiple users simultaneously through group membership, integrating with SCIM provisioning and identity providers like Okta for automated access management.

## API Endpoints and Technical Integration

The platform provides several key APIs for programmatic management:

- **User Management API** for SCIM 2.0 provisioning and user lifecycle management
- **User Privacy API** for GDPR/CCPA compliance and data deletion requests  
- **User Mapping API** for cross-project user identity aliasing in Portfolio implementations

**Self-service key management** enables Enterprise organizations to create, revoke, and delete API keys and secret keys through the Organization Settings interface, with a 50 active key limit and permanent revocation capabilities.

## Data Management and Compliance

**Self-service data deletion** allows Growth and Enterprise customers with Administrator privileges to permanently remove specific events and properties, with scanning limits of 1B events/month (Growth) and 10B events/month (Enterprise). The system provides **user privacy notifications** for GDPR compliance, including Job Creation, Job Completion, and Unset Violation notification types.

**Webhooks** enable Enterprise customers to configure custom monitors that automatically send triggered notifications to external endpoints when KPI-affecting user behavior changes occur, supporting real-time alerting and integration with external systems.

## Broader Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates with identity providers through **SSO provisioning** and **SCIM 2.0** support, enabling enterprise-grade user management workflows. **Slack integration** provides notification delivery for collaborative analytics workflows.

The platform supports **currency display unit** configuration for international implementations, affecting Revenue LTV charts and Event Segmentation metrics without modifying underlying data values. **Session definition configuration** and **time zone settings** ensure accurate behavioral analysis across global user bases.

**Guides and Surveys** functionality extends the platform beyond analytics into user engagement and feedback collection, while **Visual Labeling** and **custom events** enable sophisticated behavioral tracking implementations.
