Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics platform that provides organizations with tools to track, analyze, and act on user behavior data. The platform offers sophisticated account management capabilities designed to support enterprise-scale deployments with granular access controls, data governance features, and flexible organizational structures.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

Amplitude's account management system operates on a hierarchical organizational model with **Organizations** at the top level containing multiple **Projects**. Each project represents a distinct data environment with its own API keys, secret keys, session definitions, and time zone configurations. This structure enables companies to segment different products, environments, or business units while maintaining centralized administrative control.

The platform's **Portfolio** feature extends this architecture by enabling cross-project analysis through **Views** that merge up to 5 projects (expandable to 10 with approval) into unified dashboards. This capability uses user ID/device ID matching and the **User Mapping API** for aliasing different user identifiers across projects, making it particularly valuable for organizations with multiple touchpoints or product lines.

**Permission Groups** provide scalable access management by allowing administrators to assign project permissions to multiple users simultaneously through group membership. The system implements a highest-permission-wins model when users belong to multiple groups or have individual permissions, ensuring appropriate access escalation.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**User Roles** follow a four-tier hierarchy:
- **Viewer**: Read-only access to discoverable content
- **Member**: Can create and edit content, manage behavioral cohorts and saved segments
- **Manager**: Additional capabilities including API key management, derived properties, and Guides/Surveys
- **Admin**: Full organizational control including user management, billing, SSO configuration, and data deletion

**Dynamic Behavioral Sampling** through the **Scale** feature enables ultra-high volume customers to manage costs by sampling events based on user identity while maintaining analysis accuracy through upsampling metrics. This algorithmic sampling framework preserves complete user event streams for sampled users.

**Session Replay** settings control user session capture with configurable sample rates, requiring SDK implementation and providing privacy notification controls.

**SCIM 2.0 Provisioning** enables programmatic user and group management through identity providers like Okta, supporting standard schema fields including userName, givenName, familyName, email, and active status attributes.

## Data Governance and Compliance Features

Amplitude provides robust data governance capabilities including **Self-Service Data Deletion** for Growth and Enterprise plans, allowing administrators to permanently remove events and properties through a task-based queue system. The platform enforces scanning limits of 1B events/month for Growth plans and 10B events/month for Enterprise plans.

**User Privacy Notifications** support GDPR and privacy regulation compliance by configuring email alerts for data deletion requests, including Job Creation, Job Completion, and Unset Violation notification types at the project level.

**Webhooks** enable real-time integration with external systems by automatically sending triggered monitor notifications when KPI-affecting user behavior changes occur, available for Enterprise customers with the Insights package.

## API Endpoints and Technical Integration

The platform exposes several key APIs:
- **User Management API**: Programmatic user and group management with SCIM integration
- **User Mapping API**: Cross-project user identity aliasing for Portfolio functionality  
- **User Privacy API**: Automated data deletion request processing
- **Dashboard Rest API** and **HTTP API**: Programmatic access to analytics data and configurations

**API Key and Secret Key Management** provides self-service capabilities for Managers and Admins to create, revoke, and delete authentication credentials with a 50 active keys limit and 6-hour deletion confirmation window.

## Broader Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates with enterprise identity providers through **SSO configuration** and supports **Slack integration** for notifications and collaboration. The platform's **Team Spaces** feature enables project-based collaboration with inherited permissions from groups.

Currency display units can be configured at the project level, affecting Revenue LTV charts, Event Segmentation revenue metrics, and Data Tables without modifying underlying data values. The system supports **Query Time Sampling** for performance optimization and provides comprehensive **Usage Reports** dashboards for monitoring platform utilization.

The account management system is designed to scale from small teams to enterprise deployments, with many advanced features like Permission Groups, Portfolio, SCIM provisioning, and Self-Service Data Deletion restricted to Growth and Enterprise plans, ensuring appropriate feature access based on organizational needs and compliance requirements.
