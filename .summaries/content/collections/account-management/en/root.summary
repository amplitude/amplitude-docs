Amplitude's Account Management system provides comprehensive organizational and project administration capabilities for analytics platform governance. The system operates on a hierarchical structure with organization-level settings that cascade to individual projects, supporting multi-project environments through Portfolio views and cross-project analysis capabilities.

## Core Product Architecture

The account management framework centers around Organizations as the top-level entity, containing multiple Projects that can be managed individually or collectively. Projects serve as data containers with distinct API keys, secret keys, and configuration settings including session definitions, time zones, currency display units, and sampling parameters. The Portfolio feature enables Enterprise customers to create Views that merge up to 5-10 projects for cross-project analysis using User ID/Device ID matching and the User Mapping API for user aliasing across projects.

## User Management and Access Control

The platform implements a four-tier role hierarchy: Viewer, Member, Manager, and Admin, with escalating permissions for content access, creation, and administrative functions. Enterprise plans support Permission Groups for bulk user provisioning and project-level permission assignment, with the system granting the highest permission level when users have multiple role assignments. User provisioning integrates with SCIM 2.0 protocols through the User Management API, supporting identity providers like Okta with core schema fields including userName, givenName, familyName, email, and active status.

## Key Administrative Features

**API Key Management**: Enterprise organizations access self-service key management through Organization Settings, allowing Managers and Admins to create, revoke, and delete API keys and secret keys with Key ID identifiers, subject to 50 active key limits and 6-hour deletion propagation periods.

**Data Volume Control**: The Scale feature provides dynamic behavioral sampling for Enterprise plans, implementing user identity-based sampling to manage costs for high-volume customers while maintaining analysis accuracy through upsampling metrics and preserving complete user event streams.

**Privacy and Compliance**: Self-service data deletion capabilities allow Growth and Enterprise Administrator users to permanently remove specific events and properties, with scanning limits of 1B events/month (Growth) and 10B events/month (Enterprise). The system includes GDPR compliance notifications for data deletion requests with configurable email alerts for Job Creation, Job Completion, and Unset Violation events.

## Technical Integration Points

**Webhooks**: Enterprise customers can configure webhook endpoints for custom monitor notifications, automatically triggering external system alerts when KPI-related behavioral changes occur.

**Session Replay Configuration**: Project-level settings include Session Replay sample rate configuration and capture toggles for user session recording management.

**Currency and Localization**: Projects support currency display unit configuration affecting Revenue LTV charts, Event Segmentation revenue metrics, and Data Tables without modifying underlying data values.

## Operational Workflows

The system supports bulk operations including user invitation through the Members & Groups settings page, content ownership transfer for charts, dashboards, and cohorts, and email domain migration processes. Project deletion and organization URL modifications require Customer Success Manager contact or support ticket submission. The platform maintains project-specific user property silos while enabling global user ID merging through the Portfolio functionality, supporting comprehensive cross-product user journey analysis within the broader Amplitude analytics ecosystem.
