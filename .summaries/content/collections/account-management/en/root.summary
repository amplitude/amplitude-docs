Amplitude's Account Management system provides comprehensive organizational and project administration capabilities for analytics platform governance. The system operates on a hierarchical permission model with four distinct user roles (Viewer, Member, Manager, Admin) that control access to analytics features, content management, and administrative functions across both organization and project levels.

## Core Features and Capabilities

The account management system centers around organizational settings that control billing, user permissions, SSO configuration, and Session Replay capture settings with configurable sample rates. Key administrative functions include project configuration management (API keys, secret keys, session definitions, time zones), user approval workflows, and comprehensive notification systems for GDPR compliance and privacy regulation adherence.

For high-volume Enterprise customers, the Scale feature provides dynamic behavioral sampling based on user identity to manage costs while maintaining analysis accuracy through upsampling metrics. The system supports self-service data deletion capabilities with scanning limits of 1B events/month for Growth plans and 10B events/month for Enterprise plans.

## Product Relationships and Integration

The account management system integrates deeply with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem through several key mechanisms:

**Portfolio Views** enable cross-project analysis by merging up to 5 projects (or 10 with approval) into unified displays using user ID/device ID matching and the User Mapping API for aliasing different user identifiers across projects.

**Permission Groups** (Enterprise-only) allow bulk assignment of project permissions through group membership, with the system automatically granting the highest permission level when users have multiple assignments. These integrate with Team Spaces and can be managed through the User Management API and SCIM API.

**SCIM 2.0 Provisioning** provides programmatic user and group management through identity provider integration, particularly with Okta, supporting standard user schema fields (userName, givenName, familyName, email, active attributes).

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**User Roles Hierarchy:**
- **Viewer**: Read-only access to discoverable content
- **Member**: Can create and edit own content, access behavioral cohorts
- **Manager**: Full content management, user invitation, project settings access
- **Admin**: Complete organizational control including billing, SSO, and user management

**Project-Level Components:**
- **API Keys/Secret Keys**: Authentication credentials with self-service management for Enterprise customers (50 active key limit)
- **Session Definitions**: Configurable user session parameters
- **Currency Display Units**: Project-specific revenue visualization formatting
- **Sample Rate Configuration**: Controls for Session Replay capture and behavioral sampling

**Data Management Terms:**
- **Dynamic Behavioral Sampling**: User identity-based event sampling for volume management
- **Upsampling Metrics**: Statistical correction for sampled data analysis
- **Self-Service Data Deletion**: Permanent removal of specific events and properties
- **User Privacy Notifications**: GDPR compliance alerts for data deletion requests

## Broader Ecosystem Integration

The account management system serves as the foundational layer for Amplitude's analytics platform, controlling access to:

**Analytics Features**: Revenue LTV charts, Event Segmentation metrics, Data Tables, Visual Labeling, custom events, and derived properties

**Content Management**: Dashboards, notebooks, behavioral cohorts, team spaces, and content ownership transfers

**Compliance and Privacy**: User Privacy API integration, GDPR/CCPA compliance workflows, and automated privacy regulation notifications

**External Integrations**: Slack integration for notifications, webhook configurations for custom monitors, and SSO provider connectivity

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**User Management API**: Programmatic user and group management with SCIM 2.0 support
**User Privacy API**: Automated data deletion request processing
**User Mapping API**: Cross-project user identity aliasing for Portfolio Views

**Key Management Interface**: Self-service API key and secret key creation, revocation, and deletion through Organization Settings

**Webhook Configuration**: Custom monitor endpoints for real-time KPI behavior change notifications (Enterprise Insights package)

The system requires specific SDK implementation for Session Replay functionality and supports CSV export settings for usage reports and analytics data extraction. Administrative functions are accessible through the Organization Settings interface, with most advanced features requiring Enterprise plan subscriptions and appropriate user role permissions.
