**Summary:** Portfolio enables cross-project analysis in Amplitude Enterprise by creating Views that merge multiple projects (up to 5, or 10 with account team approval) into a single display, using user ID/device ID matching and the User Mapping API for aliasing different user IDs across projects while maintaining project-specific user property silos.
