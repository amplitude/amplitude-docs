# Summary
Portfolio is an Enterprise-level feature that enables cross-project analysis by creating Views that merge data from multiple Amplitude Projects (up to 5-10 projects), allowing organizations to track user behavior across different products while maintaining project-specific user properties and supporting user mapping via API for reconciling different user IDs.
