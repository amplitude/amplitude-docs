Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that provides a suite of chart types and analytical tools for understanding user behavior, conversion patterns, and product engagement. The platform enables organizations to track, analyze, and optimize user journeys through sophisticated event-based analytics and segmentation capabilities.

## Core Chart Types and Features

The platform offers 16+ distinct chart types organized around four primary use cases: knowing your users, converting users, retaining users, and monetizing. Key chart types include:

**Foundational Analytics:**
- **Event Segmentation**: Count and filter events to understand user behavior patterns
- **Funnel Analysis**: Track conversion rates and identify drop-off points in user flows
- **Retention Analysis**: Measure how frequently users return to the product over time
- **User Sessions**: Analyze session-based user behavior and engagement patterns

**Advanced Analytics:**
- **Journeys**: Visualize sequences of user actions and path analysis
- **Personas**: Create user clusters based on behavioral similarities using machine learning
- **Engagement Matrix**: Understand feature engagement by breadth and frequency
- **Impact Analysis**: Measure how first-time feature engagement affects subsequent behaviors
- **Stickiness**: Analyze event frequency within time intervals to identify habit-forming features
- **Lifecycle**: Categorize users as New, Current, Resurrected, or Dormant
- **Compass**: Identify behavioral thresholds that predict retention and growth
- **Revenue LTV**: Analyze lifetime value and monetization patterns
- **Experiment Results**: Conduct A/B testing with statistical significance analysis

## Key Components and Modules

**Events Module**: Central component for event selection and configuration, supporting default Amplitude events (Top Global Events, Any Active Event, New User), wildcard search with glob operators, and custom event grouping with OR logic. Events can be filtered and grouped using event properties and user properties.

**Segmentation Module**: Advanced user targeting system supporting multiple user categories (any users, active users, new users), complex filtering with user properties and behavioral cohorts, and segment saving/reuse functionality. Supports inline cohort creation with the "+ Performed" feature.

**Measured As Module**: Provides various measurement options for quantifying user behavior and event occurrences across different chart types.

## Core Nomenclature and Definitions

**Array Operators**: Sophisticated filtering system including "is/is not", "contains/does not contain", "set is/set is not", "set contains/set does not contain" for precise event and property filtering.

**Filter Operators**: Comprehensive set including exact matching, substring matching (contains), prefix matching (starts with), set operations, and wildcard matching (glob match) with support for OR/AND clause logic.

**Group-by Functionality**: Enables data breakdown with specific limits (100 values for single group-by, 500 for dual group-by) and automatic pruning based on top activity within specified timeframes.

**Behavioral Cohorts**: User segments defined by specific behavioral patterns that can be created inline or saved for reuse across multiple analyses.

**Property Types**: Distinction between event properties (attributes of specific events) and user properties (attributes of users), with support for nested object arrays through cart analysis features.

## Technical Architecture and Performance

**Query Optimization**: The platform implements intelligent caching based on query intervals (real-time, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly) and offers query time sampling using 10% random user samples with statistical up-sampling for performance optimization.

**Data Processing**: Supports property splitting for object arrays, enabling sophisticated e-commerce and cart analysis with cross-property, parallel, item match, and collection match filtering capabilities.

**Export and Integration**: Provides CSV export functionality with specific limits (10,000 for standard exports, 20,000 for Dashboard REST API), chart sharing capabilities, and integration with dashboards and notebooks.

## Specialized Features

**Event Explorer**: Real-time event stream visualization tool for taxonomy exploration and instrumentation QA, allowing user targeting by IP address, user ID, device ID, or user properties.

**Cart Analysis**: Advanced feature for analyzing object arrays, particularly valuable for e-commerce analytics, requiring property splitting setup in Amplitude Data.

**Custom Events**: Ability to create grouped events using OR logic for analyzing users who trigger any of several specified events, useful for funnel conversion steps.

**Data Tables**: Multi-metric comparison and breakdown functionality in a single view for comprehensive analysis.

**Color Customization**: Organization-level theme management for Growth/Enterprise plans, supporting custom themes with 8-16 colors using hex values or color picker.

The platform integrates with Amplitude Data for advanced data management and supports various API endpoints for programmatic access. Chart creation includes keyboard shortcuts for efficient workflow management, and the system provides comprehensive annotation and release tracking capabilities for contextualizing analytical insights.
