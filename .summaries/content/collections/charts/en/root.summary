Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that provides a suite of chart types and analysis tools for understanding user behavior, conversion, retention, and monetization. The platform enables organizations to track events, analyze user journeys, and derive actionable insights from user data through various specialized chart types and analytical modules.

## Core Chart Types and Features

The platform offers 17+ distinct chart types organized into four primary use case categories:

**Know Your Users**: Event Segmentation (event counting and filtering), User Sessions (session-based analysis), Data Tables (multi-metric comparison), User Composition (user property analysis), and Event Explorer (real-time event streams)

**Convert Your Users**: Funnel Analysis (conversion tracking), Journeys (user path analysis), and Experiment Results (A/B testing outcomes)

**Retain Your Users**: Retention Analysis (return behavior), Lifecycle (user categorization as New/Current/Resurrected/Dormant), Stickiness (event frequency measurement), and Impact Analysis (feature engagement correlation)

**Monetize**: Revenue LTV (lifetime value analysis), Personas (behavioral clustering), Engagement Matrix (feature breadth vs frequency), and Compass (behavioral threshold identification)

## Key Analytical Modules and Components

**Events Module**: Central component for event selection supporting default Amplitude events (Top Global Events, Any Active Event, New User), wildcard search with glob operators, event filtering, and grouping using event and user properties. Includes custom event creation through OR logic grouping.

**Segmentation Module**: Advanced user segment creation supporting multiple user categories (any users, active users, new users), complex filtering with user properties and behavioral cohorts, inline cohort creation with "+ Performed" feature, and segment saving/reuse functionality.

**Measured As Module**: Provides various measurement options for quantifying events and user behavior across different chart types.

## Advanced Filtering and Operators

The platform employs sophisticated array operators including:
- Basic operators: is, is not, contains, does not contain
- Set operators: set is, set is not, set contains, set does not contain
- Advanced matching: glob match (wildcard), starts with, exact values, substring matching
- Logical operators: OR/AND clause combinations for complex filtering

## Performance Optimization and Data Management

**Query Performance**: Implements query time sampling using 10% random user samples with up-sampling via inverse sampling methods. Includes automatic data pruning with limits of 100 values for single group-by and 500 for dual group-by operations.

**Caching System**: Employs tiered caching based on query intervals (real-time, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly) to optimize performance while maintaining data freshness.

**Data Limits**: Enforces various limits including CSV export (10,000 rows), Dashboard REST API (20,000 rows), and breakdown table restrictions to maintain system performance.

## Specialized Analysis Capabilities

**Cart Analysis**: Supports behavioral insights through object array analysis, particularly valuable for e-commerce analytics. Requires property splitting setup in Amplitude Data and supports cross-property, parallel, item match, and collection match filtering.

**Real-time Analysis**: Event Explorer provides real-time event stream visualization, enabling users to view events as they're triggered by specific users (identified by IP address, user ID, device ID, or user properties).

**Behavioral Cohorts**: Advanced segmentation allowing creation of user groups based on specific behavioral patterns and event sequences.

## Customization and Enterprise Features

**Color Themes**: Chart color customization with organization-level default themes (Growth/Enterprise plans), supporting 8-16 colors per theme using hex values or color picker.

**Annotations and Releases**: Chart annotation system for marking significant events and product releases.

**Plan-based Access**: Feature availability varies across Starter, Plus, Growth, and Enterprise tiers, with advanced features like Personas, Compass, and Revenue LTV typically requiring higher-tier plans.

## Integration and Export Capabilities

The platform supports various integration methods including dashboard integration, notebook integration, CSV downloads, and REST API access. Charts can be shared across teams and embedded in external systems. The platform also includes keyboard shortcuts for efficient chart creation workflows and template systems for standardized analysis patterns.

## Data Processing and API Integration

Supports integration with external data sources and includes specialized tools like the Instrumentation Explorer Chrome plugin for development and QA workflows. The platform processes both real-time and batched events, with specific handling for different event types and exclusion rules for system events like Identify events.
