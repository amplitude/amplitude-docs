Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior through event tracking, segmentation, and advanced analytics. The platform provides a suite of chart types and analytical tools designed to help teams make data-driven decisions across the entire user lifecycle.

## Core Chart Types and Analytics Capabilities

The platform offers 16+ distinct chart types organized around four primary use cases:

**Know Your Users**: Event Segmentation for counting and filtering events, Data Tables for multi-metric comparisons, User Sessions for session-based analysis, and Event Explorer for real-time event stream visualization.

**Convert Your Users**: Funnel Analysis for conversion tracking, Journeys for user path analysis, and Experiment Results for A/B testing statistical analysis.

**Retain Your Users**: Retention Analysis for return behavior tracking, Lifecycle charts for user categorization (New, Current, Resurrected, Dormant), Stickiness analysis for event frequency measurement, and Compass for identifying behavioral thresholds that predict retention.

**Monetize**: Revenue LTV for lifetime value analysis, Impact Analysis for feature engagement correlation, Engagement Matrix for feature breadth and frequency analysis, and Personas for behavioral clustering.

## Key Platform Components and Modules

**Events Module**: Central component for event selection and configuration, supporting default Amplitude events (Top Global Events, Any Active Event, New User), wildcard search with glob operators, custom event grouping with OR logic, and event property filtering. Events can be added to charts through the "Add Event or Metric" interface.

**Segmentation Module**: Advanced user targeting system supporting multiple user categories (any users, active users, new users), complex filtering with user properties and behavioral cohorts, inline cohort creation with the "+ Performed" feature, and segment saving/reuse functionality.

**Measured As Module**: Provides different measurement options for events and metrics within charts.

## Core Nomenclature and Definitions

**Array Operators**: Comprehensive set of filtering operators including basic operators (is, is not, contains, does not contain) and set operators (set is, set is not, set contains, set does not contain) for event and property filtering.

**Filter Operators**: Extended operator set including exact matching (is), substring matching (contains), prefix matching (starts with), array set operations, and wildcard matching (glob match) with support for OR/AND clause logic.

**User Properties vs Event Properties**: Distinction between attributes associated with users versus attributes associated with specific events, both usable for filtering and segmentation.

**Behavioral Cohorts**: User groups defined by specific behavioral patterns, can be created inline within charts or saved for reuse across analyses.

**Group-by Functionality**: Feature for breaking down results by property values with specific limits (100 values for single group-by, 500 for dual group-by) and automatic pruning when limits are exceeded.

## Advanced Features and Capabilities

**Cart Analysis**: Specialized feature for e-commerce analysis supporting object arrays through property splitting, enabling analysis of shopping cart flows with cross-property, parallel, item match, and collection match filtering options (available in Growth and Enterprise plans).

**Query Performance Optimization**: Built-in sampling feature that analyzes 10% random user samples and up-samples results using inverse sampling methods, configurable at chart and project levels.

**Real-time Capabilities**: Event Explorer provides real-time event stream visualization with user targeting by IP address, user ID, device ID, or user properties for instrumentation QA and taxonomy exploration.

**Data Export and Integration**: CSV export functionality, Dashboard REST API with 20,000 limit, breakdown tables for data review and analysis, and integration with dashboards and notebooks.

## Chart Customization and Management

**Visual Customization**: Chart color theme system supporting custom themes with 8-16 colors using hex values, organization-level default themes for Growth/Enterprise plans, Y-axis customization including dual Y-axis support for event segmentation.

**Chart Operations**: Comprehensive sharing capabilities, custom legend labels, annotations and releases functionality, keyboard shortcuts for workflow optimization, and chart caching with different intervals (real-time, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly) based on query types.

**Data Management**: Automatic data pruning and ordering by top activity within timeframes, breakdown table functionality for sorting, filtering, and data review, and series selection capabilities.

## Platform Architecture and Access Control

**Plan-based Feature Access**: Tiered availability across Starter, Plus, Growth, and Enterprise plans with advanced features like cart analysis, custom color themes, and organization-level settings restricted to higher tiers.

**User Permissions**: Role-based access control with admin/manager/member permissions affecting chart creation and data access capabilities.

**Performance Limits**: Built-in query limits and result restrictions to maintain platform performance, including group-by limits, CSV export limits (10,000), and API limits (20,000).

The platform integrates with external tools through APIs and supports advanced SQL querying capabilities for direct Snowflake access, positioning it as an enterprise-grade analytics solution for comprehensive user behavior analysis and product optimization.
