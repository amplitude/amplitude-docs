Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior through event tracking, segmentation, and advanced analytics. The platform provides a suite of chart types and analytical tools designed to help teams make data-driven decisions about user acquisition, conversion, retention, and monetization.

## Core Chart Types and Analytics Capabilities

The platform offers 15+ distinct chart types organized around key business objectives:

**User Understanding & Segmentation:**
- **Event Segmentation**: Core chart for counting and filtering events to understand user behavior patterns
- **User Sessions**: Analyzes session-based user behavior and engagement patterns
- **Data Tables**: Multi-metric comparison and breakdown views for comprehensive event analysis
- **User Composition**: Demographic and behavioral user breakdowns

**Conversion Analysis:**
- **Funnel Analysis**: Tracks conversion rates and drop-off points across user journeys
- **Journeys**: Visualizes user path sequences and navigation patterns
- **Experiment Results**: A/B testing analysis with statistical significance testing

**Retention & Engagement:**
- **Retention Analysis**: Measures user return behavior and long-term engagement
- **Stickiness**: Analyzes event frequency within time intervals to identify habit-forming behaviors
- **Lifecycle**: Categorizes users as New, Current, Resurrected, or Dormant
- **Engagement Matrix**: Maps feature usage by breadth and frequency

**Advanced Analytics:**
- **Personas**: Machine learning-based user clustering and behavioral segmentation
- **Impact Analysis**: Correlates feature engagement with downstream behavior changes
- **Compass**: Identifies behavioral thresholds that predict retention and growth
- **Revenue LTV**: Lifetime value analysis and monetization tracking

## Key Platform Components and Architecture

**Events Module**: Central component for event selection, filtering, and configuration. Supports wildcard search with glob match operators, default Amplitude events (Top Global Events, Any Active Event, New User), and custom event grouping with OR logic.

**Segmentation Module**: Advanced user targeting system supporting behavioral cohorts, user property filtering, and complex segment definitions using AND/OR clause logic. Enables inline cohort creation and bulk property value selection.

**Event Explorer**: Real-time event stream visualization tool for taxonomy exploration, instrumentation QA, and live event monitoring by user ID, device ID, or IP address.

## Core Nomenclature and Definitions

**Array Operators**: Filtering logic including `is`, `is not`, `contains`, `does not contain`, `set is`, `set is not`, `set contains`, `set does not contain` for precise event and property matching.

**Group-by Functionality**: Categorization system with result limits (100 for single group-by, 500 for double group-by) and intelligent ordering by metric priority.

**Cart Analysis**: E-commerce-specific feature for analyzing object arrays with property splitting, supporting cross-property vs parallel filtering semantics.

**Query Time Sampling**: Performance optimization using 10% random user sampling with inverse sampling methods for large-scale analysis.

**Behavioral Cohorts**: User segments defined by specific action sequences, created inline or saved for reuse across charts.

## Data Management and Performance

The platform implements sophisticated caching mechanisms with different durations based on time intervals:
- Realtime queries: No caching
- Hourly/Daily: Short-term caching
- Weekly/Monthly/Quarterly/Yearly: Extended caching periods
- Dashboard and API calls have separate cache optimization

Data pruning automatically manages large result sets, with CSV exports supporting up to 10,000 values and Dashboard REST API supporting up to 20,000 values.

## Integration and Extensibility

**API Integration**: Comprehensive REST API for programmatic access to chart data and configurations, with specific caching behaviors for API calls.

**Amplitude Data Integration**: Deep integration with Amplitude's data management layer for property splitting, custom event creation, and advanced filtering capabilities.

**Chrome Plugin**: Instrumentation Explorer for real-time event validation and debugging.

**Multi-Project Support**: Organization-level settings for theme management, default configurations, and cross-project analytics.

## Enterprise and Collaboration Features

**Plan-Based Access**: Feature availability across Starter, Plus, Growth, and Enterprise tiers, with advanced features like Personas, Impact Analysis, and Revenue LTV restricted to higher tiers.

**Customization Options**: Custom color themes (8-16 colors), organization-level defaults, dual Y-axis support, and custom legend labeling.

**Sharing and Export**: Comprehensive sharing capabilities, CSV export functionality, and dashboard integration with collaborative features including annotations and releases.

The platform serves as a complete analytics ecosystem where events flow through various chart types, each optimized for specific analytical use cases, while maintaining consistent filtering, segmentation, and performance optimization across all components.
