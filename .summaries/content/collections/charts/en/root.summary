Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that provides a suite of chart types and analysis tools for understanding user behavior, conversion patterns, and product performance. The platform enables organizations to analyze event data, user segments, and behavioral patterns through various specialized chart types and visualization tools.

## Core Chart Types and Analysis Tools

The platform offers 15+ distinct chart types organized around four primary use cases:

**Know Your Users:**
- **Event Segmentation**: Count and filter events to understand user behavior patterns
- **Data Tables**: Compare and break down events and metrics in tabular format
- **User Sessions**: Analyze session-based user behavior and engagement
- **Event Explorer**: Real-time event stream visualization for taxonomy exploration and instrumentation QA

**Convert Your Users:**
- **Funnel Analysis**: Track conversion rates and drop-off points across user journeys
- **Journeys**: Analyze sequences of user actions and path analysis

**Retain Your Users:**
- **Retention Analysis**: Measure how often users return to the product
- **Stickiness**: Analyze frequency of event performance within time intervals
- **Lifecycle**: Categorize users as New, Current, Resurrected, or Dormant
- **Engagement Matrix**: Understand feature engagement by breadth and frequency

**Advanced Analytics:**
- **Personas**: Cluster users based on behavioral similarities using machine learning
- **Experiment Results**: Analyze A/B test outcomes with statistical significance
- **Impact Analysis**: Measure how engagement with one feature affects other behaviors
- **Compass**: Identify behavioral thresholds that predict retention and growth
- **Revenue LTV**: Analyze lifetime value and monetization patterns

## Key Platform Components and Architecture

**Events Module**: Central component for event selection and configuration, supporting:
- Default Amplitude events (Top Global Events, Any Active Event, New User)
- Wildcard search with glob match operators
- Event property filtering and grouping
- Custom event creation through OR logic grouping

**Segmentation Module**: Advanced user segmentation capabilities including:
- User categories (any users, active users, new users)
- Filter by clauses with user properties
- Behavioral cohort creation with "+ Performed" clause
- Inline cohort definitions and saved segment functionality

**Measured As Module**: Defines how events are quantified and analyzed across different chart types.

## Core Nomenclature and Definitions

**Array Operators**: Set of filtering operators including `is`, `is not`, `contains`, `does not contain`, `set is`, `set is not`, `set contains`, `set does not contain` for precise event and property filtering.

**Group-by Functionality**: Categorization feature with specific limits:
- Single group-by: 100 value limit
- Double group-by: 500 value limit
- Results ordered by metric priority (uniques, totals, frequency)

**Cart Analysis**: Specialized feature for e-commerce analytics using object arrays with property splitting, supporting cross-property and parallel filtering semantics.

**Query Time Sampling**: Performance optimization feature using 10% random user sampling with inverse sampling methods for up-scaling results.

**Breakdown Table**: Interactive data review interface supporting column sorting, summary aggregation, series selection, and CSV export capabilities.

## Integration and Ecosystem

The platform integrates with broader data infrastructure through:
- **Amplitude Data**: Configuration hub for property splitting and data management
- **Identify API**: User property management with append() and set() methods
- **REST API**: Programmatic access with specific cache times and data limits
- **Snowflake Integration**: Direct querying through Amplitude SQL
- **Chrome Plugin**: Instrumentation Explorer for real-time debugging

## Plan-Based Feature Access

Features are tiered across Starter, Plus, Growth, and Enterprise plans, with advanced analytics capabilities like Personas, Impact Analysis, and Compass typically available on higher-tier plans. Organization-level customization features (custom color themes, default settings) are available on Growth/Enterprise plans.

## Performance and Caching

The platform implements sophisticated caching strategies based on time intervals:
- Realtime, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly intervals
- Chart-specific cache times optimized for different analysis patterns
- CSV export limits (10,000 rows) and Dashboard REST API limits (20,000 rows)

## API Endpoints and Commands

Key interface elements include:
- Keyboard shortcuts: Shift+e (Event Segmentation), Shift+f (Funnel), Shift+g (other charts)
- Lightning bolt icon for sampling configuration
- "+ Performed" clause for behavioral cohort creation
- "Add Event to Chart" functionality from Event Explorer
- Bulk property selection through comma-separated value pasting
