   - **Revenue LTV**: Measures user monetization effectiveness
   - **Compass**: Finds behavior thresholds that predict retention
   - **Stickiness**: Measures frequency of event performance
   - **Personas**: Clusters users based on similar behaviors
   - **Impact Analysis**: Shows how first-time engagement affects other behaviors
   - **User Sessions**: Analyzes session-based user behavior
   - **Engagement Matrix**: Visualizes feature engagement by breadth and frequency
   - **Lifecycle**: Categorizes users as New, Current, Resurrected, or Dormant

2. **Supporting Features**:
   - **Segmentation Module**: Allows creation and refinement of user segments
   - **Events Module**: Enables selection and grouping of events for analysis
   - **Cart Analysis**: Specialized for e-commerce object arrays analysis

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Events**: User actions tracked in the product (e.g., page views, button clicks)
2. **User Segments**: Groups of users defined by properties or behaviors
3. **Filter by Specification**: Conditions that limit which events are included in analysis
4. **Group-by Specification**: Dimensions used to segment data in charts
5. **Behavioral Cohorts**: Groups of users who performed specific actions
6. **Array Operators**:
   - **Equals**: Exact match for a single value
   - **Set Contains**: Matches if array contains specified value
   - **Set Equals**: Matches if array contains exactly the specified values
7. **Query Time Sampling**: Performance optimization technique analyzing 10% of users
8. **Object Arrays**: Structured data format for analyzing complex objects like shopping carts
9. **Custom Events**: User-defined combinations of multiple events with OR relationships

## Integration with Broader Ecosystem

1. **Dashboard Integration**: Charts can be added to dashboards for comprehensive views
2. **Project Switching**: Users can switch between different projects while maintaining chart context
3. **Annotations/Releases**: Charts support annotations to mark significant events or releases
4. **Organization-level Settings**: Features like custom color themes can be managed at the organization level
