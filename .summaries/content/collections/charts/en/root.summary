# Amplitude Charts: Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude Charts is a comprehensive analytics platform that enables users to visualize, analyze, and derive insights from user behavior data. The platform offers a diverse set of chart types organized around key business goals: knowing your users, converting users, retaining users, and monetizing your product. Amplitude Charts provides powerful visualization tools that help product teams understand user engagement, conversion funnels, retention patterns, and revenue metrics.

The platform supports various analysis methodologies through specialized chart types, including Event Segmentation for basic event counting and filtering, Funnel Analysis for conversion tracking, Retention Analysis for measuring user return rates, and more advanced analytics like Personas for behavioral clustering and Impact Analysis for feature adoption impact measurement.

## Product Relationships and Features

Amplitude Charts is organized into several key chart types, each serving specific analytical needs:

1. **Core Analysis Charts**:
   - **Event Segmentation**: The fundamental chart type for counting and filtering events to understand user behavior
   - **Funnel Analysis**: Tracks conversion and drop-off rates between key events
   - **Retention Analysis**: Measures how often users return to the product
   - **Data Tables**: Compares and breaks down events and metrics in a single view

2. **User Journey Charts**:
   - **Journeys**: Analyzes sequences of steps taken by users
   - **User Sessions**: Counts and filters sessions to understand user behavior patterns

3. **Advanced Analysis Charts**:
   - **Revenue LTV**: Measures how well users are being monetized
   - **Compass**: Identifies thresholds of user behavior that predict retention
   - **Stickiness**: Measures how frequently users perform specific events
   - **Personas**: Determines clusters of users by grouping those with similar behaviors
   - **Impact Analysis**: Shows how first-time engagement with one feature affects other behaviors
   - **User Sessions**: Analyzes session-based metrics
   - **Engagement Matrix**: Visualizes feature engagement by breadth and frequency
   - **Lifecycle**: Breaks down user base by New, Current, Resurrected, and Dormant Users

4. **Experimental Analysis**:
   - **Experiment Results**: Identifies statistically significant outcomes of A/B tests

5. **Advanced Query Options**:
   - **SQL-based Charts**: Direct querying of Snowflake for custom analytics

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Events Module**: Component for selecting and configuring events to analyze in charts
2. **Segmentation Module**: Tool for defining and refining user segments based on properties or behaviors
3. **Group-by**: Feature that categorizes events by specified properties, limited to 100 values for single group-by and 500 for double group-by
4. **Filter by specification**: Conditions applied to events to refine analysis
5. **Array operators**: Operators for analyzing array data (equals, set contains, set equals, etc.)
6. **Behavioral cohorts**: User segments defined by specific behaviors or actions
7. **Query time sampling**: Performance optimization technique that analyzes a 10% random sample of users
8. **Object arrays**: Data structure for analyzing complex nested data like shopping carts
9. **Property splitting**: Technique for analyzing child properties within parent properties
10. **Breakdown table**: Interactive data table showing chart results with sorting and export capabilities

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Charts integrates with the broader Amplitude Analytics ecosystem in several ways:

1. **Dashboard Integration**: Charts can be saved to dashboards for ongoing monitoring and sharing
2. **Annotations and Releases**: Charts support annotations to mark significant events or releases
3. **Experiment Integration**: Direct connection to experiment results for measuring impact
4. **Data Export**: Results can be exported via CSV or accessed through the Dashboard REST API
5. **Customization Options**: Organization-level chart theme customization for consistent branding
6. **Event Explorer**: Real-time event stream visualization tool that helps identify appropriate events for analysis

## Technical Specifications

1. **Chart Customization**:
   - Custom color themes with 8-16 colors
   - Y-axis customization including dual Y-axis support
   - Legend label customization

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Query time sampling for faster funnel analysis (10% user sample)
   - Data pruning to limit results (100 values for single group-by, 500 for double group-by)
   - Different cache times based on query type (hourly/daily/weekly/monthly)

3. **Advanced Filtering Capabilities**:
   - Property operators: is, contains, set is, glob match
   - AND/OR logic between filters
   - Cross-property and parallel filtering for object arrays

4. **Data Manipulation**:
   - Custom event creation by grouping multiple events with OR relationships
   - Pasting lists of property values for bulk filtering
   - Inline behavioral cohort creation

5. **Sharing and Collaboration**:
   - Chart sharing via links
   - Dashboard integration
   - Saved segments for team reuse

The Amplitude Charts platform offers different chart availability based on subscription plans (Growth, Enterprise), with the most comprehensive set of charts available to Enterprise customers.
