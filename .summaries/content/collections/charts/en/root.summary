# Amplitude Charts: Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude Charts is a comprehensive analytics platform that enables users to analyze user behavior, track product performance, and derive actionable insights from event data. The platform offers a diverse set of chart types organized around key business goals: Know, Convert, Retain, and Monetize. These charts help product teams understand how users interact with their applications, identify conversion patterns, measure retention, and track monetization metrics.

Key features of Amplitude Charts include:
- Multiple chart types for different analysis needs
- Robust segmentation capabilities
- Customizable visualizations
- Real-time event streaming
- Advanced filtering and grouping options
- Experiment analysis tools
- User journey mapping
- Behavioral cohort creation

## Product Relationships and Features

Amplitude Charts consists of several interconnected chart types, each serving specific analytical purposes:

1. **Core Analysis Charts**
   - **Event Segmentation**: The fundamental chart type for counting and filtering events to understand user behavior
   - **Funnel Analysis**: Tracks conversion and drop-off rates between key events
   - **Retention Analysis**: Measures how often users return to the product
   - **Data Tables**: Compares and breaks down events and metrics in a single view

2. **User Journey Charts**
   - **Journeys**: Analyzes sequences of steps taken by users
   - **Experiment Results**: Identifies statistically significant outcomes of A/B tests
   - **Revenue LTV**: Measures how effectively users are being monetized

3. **User Behavior Charts**
   - **Compass**: Finds thresholds of user behavior that predict retention and lead to growth
   - **Stickiness**: Measures how often users perform specific events
   - **Personas**: Determines clusters of users by grouping those with similar behaviors
   - **Impact Analysis**: Understands how first-time engagement with one feature affects other behaviors
   - **User Sessions**: Counts and filters sessions to understand user behavior

4. **User Segmentation Tools**
   - **Segmentation Module**: Allows creation of user segments based on properties and behaviors
   - **Event Explorer**: Provides real-time visualization of event streams

5. **Advanced Analysis Charts**
   - **Engagement Matrix**: Visualizes feature engagement by breadth and frequency
   - **Lifecycle**: Breaks down user base by New, Current, Resurrected, and Dormant Users
   - **SQL-based Charts**: Enables direct querying of Snowflake for custom analyses

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Events and Properties**
   - **Events**: User actions tracked in the product (e.g., page views, button clicks)
   - **Event Properties**: Attributes associated with events that provide context
   - **User Properties**: Attributes associated with users (e.g., demographics, subscription status)
   - **Group Properties**: Attributes associated with organizational groups

2. **Segmentation Concepts**
   - **User Segments**: Subsets of users defined by properties or behaviors
   - **Behavioral Cohorts**: Groups of users who have performed specific actions
   - **Filter by Specification**: Conditions that limit which events are included in analysis
   - **Group-by Specification**: Dimensions used to segment data for comparison

3. **Array Operators**
   - **Equals Operator**: Exact matching of values
   - **Set Contains**: Checks if an array contains specific values
   - **Set Equals**: Checks if arrays match exactly
   - **Glob Match**: Pattern matching using wildcards

4. **Analysis Terms**
   - **Query Time Sampling**: Performance optimization technique that analyzes a 10% random sample
   - **Data Pruning**: Limiting results to maintain performance (100 values for single group-by, 500 for double)
   - **Breakdown Table**: Tabular view of chart data with interactive features
   - **Custom Events**: User-defined combinations of multiple events with OR conditions

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Charts integrates with the broader Amplitude product ecosystem in several ways:

1. **Dashboard Integration**: Charts can be added to dashboards for regular monitoring and sharing
2. **Experiment Platform**: Charts connect with Amplitude Experiment for A/B test analysis
3. **Data Management**: Charts utilize data from Amplitude's event collection and processing system
4. **Behavioral Cohorts**: Cohorts created in charts can be used across the Amplitude platform
5. **Snowflake Integration**: SQL-based charts can directly query Snowflake data warehouses

The platform supports different subscription tiers (Growth and Enterprise) with varying feature availability. Enterprise customers have access to additional features like organization-level default color themes.

## Technical Implementation Details

1. **Chart Customization**
   - Custom color themes can be created with 8-16 colors using hex values
   - Y-axis customization including dual Y-axis support
   - Custom legend labels

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Query time sampling can be enabled for individual funnel charts or as a project-wide default
   - Different caching times apply to different query types
   - Group-by results are limited to maintain performance

3. **Data Export Options**
   - CSV export of chart data
   - Dashboard REST API access

4. **Advanced Filtering Capabilities**
   - Cross-property and parallel filtering for cart/object array analysis
   - Support for AND/OR logic in filter combinations
   - Ability to paste lists of property values for bulk filtering

5. **User Identification Methods**
   - User ID targeting
   - IP address search
   - Device ID filtering

The platform includes keyboard shortcuts for efficient chart manipulation and supports annotations and releases for contextualizing data trends over time.
