Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior through advanced charting and segmentation capabilities. The platform provides a suite of 16+ chart types designed to analyze different aspects of the user journey, from acquisition and engagement to retention and monetization.

## Core Chart Types and Relationships

The platform organizes its analytics capabilities into four primary use case categories:

**Know Your Users**: Event Segmentation serves as the foundational chart type for counting and filtering events, while User Sessions analyzes session-based behavior patterns. Data Tables provide multi-metric comparisons, and User Composition breaks down user properties.

**Convert Your Users**: Funnel Analysis tracks conversion rates and drop-off points across user journeys. Journeys visualizes user path sequences, while Experiment Results provides A/B testing statistical analysis.

**Retain Your Users**: Retention Analysis measures user return patterns, Lifecycle categorizes users into New/Current/Resurrected/Dormant segments, and Stickiness measures event frequency within intervals.

**Monetize**: Revenue LTV analyzes lifetime value and monetization effectiveness.

**Advanced Analytics**: Personas uses clustering to group similar user behaviors, Engagement Matrix plots feature breadth vs. frequency, Impact Analysis measures feature interaction effects, and Compass identifies behavioral thresholds that predict retention.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events Module**: The core component for selecting and configuring events, supporting default Amplitude events (Top Global Events, Any Active Event, New User), wildcard search with glob operators, and custom event grouping with OR logic.

**Segmentation Module**: Handles user segment creation and modification using Filter by clauses, Performed clauses (behavioral cohorts), and Group Segment by functions. Supports both user properties and behavioral cohorts with complex AND/OR logic.

**Array Operators**: A comprehensive set of filtering operators including basic operators (is, is not, contains, does not contain) and set operators (set is, set is not, set contains, set does not contain) for handling array-type event properties.

**Cart Analysis**: Specialized functionality for analyzing object arrays through property splitting, enabling cross-property filters, parallel filters, item match, and collection match capabilities.

**Group-by Functionality**: Categorization feature with automatic pruning (100 values for single group-by, 500 for double group-by) and metric-based ordering prioritization.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Analytics integrates with several complementary tools and features:

**Amplitude Data**: Required for cart analysis property splitting setup and manages data taxonomy and instrumentation.

**Event Explorer**: Real-time event stream visualization tool that connects with User Lookup and Instrumentation Explorer Chrome plugin for live debugging and QA.

**Query Time Sampling**: Performance optimization feature using 10% random user sampling with inverse sampling methods, configurable at project and dashboard levels.

**Cohorts and Segments**: Saved user segments can be reused across charts and exported for activation in other tools.

**Dashboards and Notebooks**: Charts integrate into broader reporting and collaboration workflows with sharing, annotation, and release tracking capabilities.

## Technical Implementation

**API and Performance**: The platform implements intelligent caching based on query intervals (real-time, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly) and provides REST API access with specific limits (CSV export: 10,000 rows, Dashboard REST API: 20,000 rows).

**Plan-Based Access**: Features are tiered across Starter, Plus, Growth, and Enterprise plans, with advanced features like custom color themes and organization-level settings available on Growth/Enterprise tiers.

**Data Processing**: Supports both batched and real-time event processing, with special handling for Identify events and complex property value timing considerations.

**Customization**: Extensive customization options including dual Y-axis support, custom legend labels, color theme management, and keyboard shortcuts for power users.

The platform also includes specialized tools like Amplitude SQL for direct Snowflake querying and maintains legacy chart support for backward compatibility.
