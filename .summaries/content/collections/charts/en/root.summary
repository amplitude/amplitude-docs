Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior through sophisticated event tracking, segmentation, and visualization capabilities. The platform provides a rich ecosystem of chart types and analytical tools designed to help teams make data-driven decisions across the entire user lifecycle.

## Core Chart Types and Analytical Capabilities

The platform centers around 16 primary chart types organized into four strategic categories:

**Know Your Users**: Event Segmentation for counting and filtering events, User Sessions for session-based analysis, Data Tables for multi-metric comparisons, User Composition for demographic breakdowns, and Event Explorer for real-time event stream monitoring.

**Convert Your Users**: Funnel Analysis for conversion tracking, Journeys for user path analysis, and Experiment Results for A/B testing statistical analysis.

**Retain Your Users**: Retention Analysis for return behavior measurement, Stickiness for event frequency analysis, Lifecycle for user categorization (New, Current, Resurrected, Dormant), and Engagement Matrix for feature breadth and frequency analysis.

**Monetize**: Revenue LTV for lifetime value calculations, Impact Analysis for feature correlation studies, Personas for behavioral clustering, and Compass for identifying behavioral thresholds that predict retention.

## Key Features and Functionality

### Event and User Segmentation
The platform's segmentation capabilities form the foundation of most analyses. The Events module supports wildcard search with glob operators, default Amplitude events (Top Global Events, Any Active Event, New User), and custom event grouping with OR logic. The Segmentation Module enables complex user filtering through user properties, behavioral cohorts, and inline cohort creation using the "+ Performed" feature.

### Advanced Filtering and Operators
Amplitude provides sophisticated filtering through array operators (is, is not, contains, does not contain, set is, set is not, set contains, set does not contain) and supports complex logical operations with OR/AND clauses. The platform includes specialized functionality for cart analysis through object array processing and property splitting capabilities.

### Data Processing and Performance Optimization
The system implements intelligent data management through automatic pruning (100 values for single group-by, 500 for dual group-by) and query time sampling using 10% random user samples with statistical up-sampling. Chart caching operates on different intervals (real-time, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly) based on query complexity.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events**: Trackable user actions that form the basis of all analysis, including both custom instrumented events and default Amplitude events.

**User Segments**: Defined groups of users based on properties, behaviors, or cohort membership, supporting both active and new user categorizations.

**Properties**: Attributes associated with events (event properties) or users (user properties) that enable detailed filtering and grouping.

**Cohorts**: Groups of users defined by shared characteristics or behaviors, including behavioral cohorts created through the "+ Performed" functionality.

**Group-by**: Categorization mechanism for breaking down data by specific dimensions, with support for single and dual group-by operations.

**Array Operators**: Specialized filtering operators designed for handling array-type data, including set operations and containment checks.

**Cart Analysis**: Specialized functionality for analyzing object arrays, particularly useful for e-commerce scenarios involving nested product attributes.

**Sampling**: Performance optimization technique using statistical sampling (10% user sample) with inverse sampling methods for result extrapolation.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Analytics integrates deeply with the broader Amplitude ecosystem through several key touchpoints:

**Amplitude Data**: Provides the foundational data infrastructure, including property splitting setup required for cart analysis and object array processing.

**User Lookup**: Integrates with Event Explorer for real-time user targeting and event stream analysis.

**Instrumentation Explorer Chrome Plugin**: Extends Event Explorer capabilities for real-time instrumentation quality assurance.

**Dashboard and Notebook Integration**: Charts can be shared and embedded across Amplitude's collaborative features, with dashboard-level sampling controls and organization-wide theme management.

**API Integration**: The platform supports CSV exports with 10,000 row limits and Dashboard REST API access with 20,000 row limits for programmatic data access.

## Advanced Configuration and Customization

The platform offers extensive customization through organization-level settings for Growth and Enterprise plans, including default chart color themes with 8-16 color palettes using hex values. Project administrators can configure query time sampling defaults, while individual charts support custom legend labels, dual Y-axis configurations, and annotations/releases functionality.

Chart interaction includes keyboard shortcuts for workflow optimization, breakdown table functionality for data review and export, and template-based chart creation for standardized analysis patterns. The system maintains plan-based feature availability across Starter, Plus, Growth, and Enterprise tiers, with certain advanced features like Personas clustering and Compass behavioral analysis restricted to higher-tier plans.
