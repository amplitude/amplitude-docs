# Summary
This documentation explains Amplitude's group-by feature for categorizing events, including how results are limited (100 for single group-by, 500 for double group-by) and how different metrics determine the ordering of group-by results in the Breakdown Table, with specific ordering rules for formulas with and without group-bys.
