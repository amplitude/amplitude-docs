Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that provides a suite of chart types and analysis tools for understanding user behavior, conversion patterns, and product performance. The platform enables organizations to track, analyze, and optimize user engagement through event-based analytics and advanced segmentation capabilities.

## Core Chart Types and Analysis Tools

The platform offers 16+ distinct chart types organized around four key use cases:

**Know Your Users:**
- **Event Segmentation**: Core chart for counting and filtering events to understand user behavior patterns
- **Data Tables**: Multi-metric comparison and breakdown views in tabular format
- **User Sessions**: Session-based analysis for understanding user engagement patterns
- **Event Explorer**: Real-time event stream visualization for taxonomy exploration and instrumentation QA

**Convert Your Users:**
- **Funnel Analysis**: Conversion and drop-off analysis for key user journeys
- **Journeys**: Sequential step analysis of user paths through the product
- **Experiment Results**: A/B testing analysis with statistical significance testing

**Retain Your Users:**
- **Retention Analysis**: User return behavior and cohort-based retention tracking
- **Stickiness**: Frequency-based engagement measurement within time intervals
- **Lifecycle**: User categorization into New, Current, Resurrected, and Dormant segments
- **Engagement Matrix**: Feature engagement analysis by breadth and frequency

**Advanced Analytics:**
- **Personas**: Machine learning-based user clustering and behavioral segmentation
- **Impact Analysis**: Feature correlation and first-time engagement impact measurement
- **Compass**: Retention threshold identification for growth optimization
- **Revenue LTV**: Lifetime value and monetization analysis

## Key Product Architecture and Relationships

### Events Module and Segmentation Framework
The platform centers around an **Events Module** that handles event selection, filtering, and grouping. Key components include:

- **Default Amplitude Events**: Top Global Events, Any Active Event, New User events
- **Wildcard Search**: Glob match operators for flexible event selection
- **Custom Events**: OR-logic grouping of multiple events for consolidated analysis
- **Event Properties**: Granular filtering and grouping capabilities

### Segmentation Module
The **Segmentation Module** provides user-based analysis with three core user categories:
- **Any Users**: All users in the dataset
- **Active Users**: Users who performed specific events
- **New Users**: First-time users within the analysis period

Segmentation supports complex filtering through:
- **Filter by clauses**: User property-based filtering
- **Performed clauses**: Behavioral cohort creation
- **Group Segment by**: Custom grouping and saved segments

### Data Processing and Performance Optimization
- **Query Time Sampling**: 10% random user sampling with up-sampling for performance optimization
- **Data Pruning**: 100-value limit for single group-by, 500-value limit for dual group-by
- **Caching System**: Tiered caching based on time intervals (realtime, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly)
- **Export Capabilities**: CSV export with 10,000 row limits, Dashboard REST API with 20,000 row limits

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Array and Filter Operators
- **Basic Operators**: `is`, `is not`, `contains`, `does not contain`
- **Set Operators**: `set is`, `set is not`, `set contains`, `set does not contain`
- **Advanced Operators**: `starts with`, `glob match` (wildcard matching)
- **Cross-property vs Parallel Filtering**: Different semantics for object array analysis

### Cart Analysis and Object Arrays
- **Property Splitting**: Parent/child/sibling property relationships
- **Item Match vs Collection Match**: Different filtering approaches for e-commerce data
- **Cross-property Filters**: Analysis across related properties within object arrays

### User and Event Properties
- **User Properties**: Attributes associated with users (demographics, account info)
- **Event Properties**: Attributes associated with specific events
- **Behavioral Cohorts**: User groups defined by specific action patterns
- **Inline Behavioral Cohorts**: Real-time cohort creation within chart building

## Product Ecosystem Integration

### Data Infrastructure
- **Amplitude Data**: Backend data management and property splitting configuration
- **Identify API**: User property management with `append()` and `set()` methods
- **Instrumentation Explorer**: Chrome plugin for event stream monitoring
- **User Lookup**: Integration for user identification and targeting

### Enterprise Features and Plan Tiers
The platform offers tiered access across **Starter**, **Plus**, **Growth**, and **Enterprise** plans:
- **Organization-level Settings**: Custom color themes, default configurations
- **Advanced Analytics**: Personas, Impact Analysis, Compass (higher-tier features)
- **Collaboration Tools**: Chart sharing, annotations, releases, monitors

### API and Integration Capabilities
- **Dashboard REST API**: Programmatic access to chart data
- **CSV Export**: Bulk data extraction capabilities
- **Amplitude SQL**: Direct Snowflake querying for advanced users
- **Chart Templates**: Reusable chart configurations

### Customization and Visualization
- **Dual Y-axis Support**: Advanced visualization for Event Segmentation charts
- **Custom Color Themes**: 8-16 color themes with hex values or color picker
- **Dynamic Group Properties**: Flexible property-based grouping
- **Breakdown Tables**: Interactive data exploration with sorting and filtering

The platform serves as a comprehensive analytics solution that scales from basic event tracking to advanced behavioral analysis, supporting both technical and business users through its modular chart system and flexible segmentation capabilities.
