# Amplitude Charts: Product Overview

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude Charts is a comprehensive analytics platform that enables users to analyze user behavior, track product performance, and derive actionable insights from event data. The platform organizes various chart types around four key business goals: Know, Convert, Retain, and Monetize. These charts help product teams understand user interactions, identify conversion patterns, measure retention, and track monetization metrics.

Key features include:
- Multiple specialized chart types for different analysis needs
- Robust segmentation and cohort creation capabilities
- Customizable visualizations with interactive elements
- Real-time event streaming and analysis
- Advanced filtering, grouping, and comparison options
- Experiment analysis tools for A/B testing
- User journey mapping and behavioral analysis
- Performance optimization features for large datasets

## Product Relationships and Features

Amplitude Charts consists of several interconnected chart types organized by analytical purpose:

1. **Core Analysis Charts**
   - **Event Segmentation**: The fundamental chart type for counting and filtering events
   - **Funnel Analysis**: Tracks conversion and drop-off rates between sequential events
   - **Retention Analysis**: Measures how often users return to perform specific actions
   - **Data Tables**: Provides tabular comparisons of events and metrics

2. **User Journey Charts**
   - **Journeys**: Visualizes sequences of steps taken by users
   - **Experiment Results**: Analyzes A/B test outcomes with statistical significance
   - **Revenue LTV**: Tracks user monetization over their lifetime

3. **User Behavior Charts**
   - **Compass**: Identifies behavioral thresholds that predict retention
   - **Stickiness**: Measures frequency of specific event performance
   - **Personas**: Clusters users with similar behavioral patterns
   - **Impact Analysis**: Correlates feature engagement with other behaviors
   - **User Sessions**: Analyzes session-level metrics and patterns

4. **User Segmentation Tools**
   - **Segmentation Module**: Creates user segments based on properties and behaviors
   - **Event Explorer**: Provides real-time visualization of event streams

5. **Advanced Analysis Charts**
   - **Engagement Matrix**: Maps feature engagement by breadth and frequency
   - **Lifecycle**: Categorizes users as New, Current, Resurrected, or Dormant
   - **SQL-based Charts**: Enables direct Snowflake querying for custom analyses

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Events and Properties**
   - **Events**: Tracked user actions within a product
   - **Event Properties**: Contextual attributes associated with events
   - **User Properties**: Attributes associated with individual users
   - **Group Properties**: Attributes associated with organizational groups

2. **Segmentation Concepts**
   - **User Segments**: Subsets of users defined by specific criteria
   - **Behavioral Cohorts**: Groups of users who have performed specific actions
   - **Filter by Specification**: Conditions limiting which events are included
   - **Group-by Specification**: Dimensions used to segment and compare data

3. **Array Operators**
   - **Equals Operator**: Exact value matching
   - **Set Contains**: Checks if an array contains specific values
   - **Set Equals**: Verifies exact array matches
   - **Glob Match**: Pattern matching using wildcards

4. **Analysis Terms**
   - **Query Time Sampling**: Performance optimization analyzing a 10% random sample
   - **Data Pruning**: Result limitation to maintain performance
   - **Breakdown Table**: Interactive tabular view of chart data
   - **Custom Events**: User-defined combinations of multiple events

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Charts integrates with the broader Amplitude platform:

1. **Dashboard Integration**: Charts can be added to dashboards for monitoring and sharing
2. **Experiment Platform**: Charts connect with Amplitude Experiment for A/B testing
3. **Data Management**: Charts utilize Amplitude's event collection and processing system
4. **Behavioral Cohorts**: Cohorts created in charts can be used across the platform
5. **Snowflake Integration**: SQL-based charts can directly query Snowflake

The platform offers different subscription tiers (Growth and Enterprise) with varying feature availability. Enterprise customers receive additional features like organization-level default color themes and advanced analysis capabilities.

## Technical Implementation

1. **Chart Customization**
   - Custom color themes with 8-16 colors using hex values
   - Y-axis customization including dual Y-axis support
   - Custom legend labels and display options

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Query time sampling for large datasets
   - Tiered caching times for different query types
   - Result limitations to maintain performance (100 values for single group-by, 500 for double)

3. **Data Export Options**
   - CSV export functionality
   - Dashboard REST API access for programmatic data retrieval

4. **Advanced Filtering**
   - Cross-property and parallel filtering for cart/object arrays
   - AND/OR logic combinations
   - Bulk property value filtering

5. **User Identification**
   - User ID targeting
   - IP address search
   - Device ID filtering

The platform includes keyboard shortcuts for efficient chart manipulation and supports annotations and release markers to provide context for data trends over time.
