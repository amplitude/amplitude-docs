Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that provides a suite of specialized chart types and analysis tools for understanding user behavior, conversion patterns, retention metrics, and product performance. The platform centers around event-based analytics, enabling organizations to track, analyze, and optimize user interactions across their digital products.

## Core Chart Types and Analysis Capabilities

The platform offers 16 distinct chart types organized into four primary use case categories:

**User Understanding Charts:**
- **Event Segmentation**: The foundational chart type for counting and filtering events to understand user behavior patterns
- **Data Tables**: Multi-metric comparison views for breaking down events and metrics in a unified interface
- **User Sessions**: Session-based analysis for understanding user engagement patterns
- **Personas**: Machine learning-driven user clustering to identify behavioral segments
- **Lifecycle**: User categorization into New, Current, Resurrected, and Dormant segments

**Conversion Analysis Charts:**
- **Funnel Analysis**: Multi-step conversion analysis to identify drop-off points and optimization opportunities
- **Journeys**: Sequential user path analysis to understand navigation patterns

**Retention and Engagement Charts:**
- **Retention Analysis**: Cohort-based analysis measuring how often users return to the product
- **Stickiness**: Frequency-based engagement measurement within defined time intervals
- **Engagement Matrix**: Two-dimensional analysis of feature usage by breadth and frequency

**Advanced Analytics Charts:**
- **Compass**: Behavioral threshold identification for predicting retention and growth
- **Impact Analysis**: Causal analysis measuring how first-time feature engagement affects subsequent behaviors
- **Experiment Results**: A/B testing analysis with statistical significance calculations
- **Revenue LTV**: Lifetime value and monetization analysis

## Key Platform Architecture and Relationships

The platform operates on a modular chart-building system with four core components:

1. **Events Module**: Handles event selection, including default Amplitude events (Top Global Events, Any Active Event, New User), wildcard search with glob match operators, and custom event grouping
2. **Segmentation Module**: Manages user segment definition through property filters, behavioral cohorts, and inline cohort creation
3. **Measured As Module**: Defines calculation methods and metrics
4. **Segment By Module**: Controls data grouping and categorization

Charts share common functionality including dual Y-axis support, custom legend labeling, annotation systems with date ranges and categories, and comprehensive data export capabilities through breakdown tables and CSV exports.

## Core Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events and Properties:**
- **Events**: User actions tracked within the product (clicks, page views, purchases)
- **Event Properties**: Attributes associated with specific events
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes associated with users across sessions
- **Parent/Child Properties**: Nested property structures for complex data analysis

**User Segmentation:**
- **Active Users**: Users who performed any tracked event in the specified time period
- **New Users**: First-time users within the analysis window
- **Behavioral Cohorts**: User groups defined by specific action patterns
- **Inline Cohorts**: Dynamically created user segments using the "+ Performed" clause

**Analysis Concepts:**
- **Group-by Clauses**: Data categorization with limits of 100 values for single group-by and 500 for dual group-by
- **Array Operators**: Filtering logic including is/is not, contains/does not contain, set is/set is not, set contains/set does not contain
- **Query Time Sampling**: Performance optimization using 10% random user samples with statistical up-sampling

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Analytics integrates with several complementary tools and systems:

- **Amplitude Data**: Handles data ingestion, property splitting for cart analysis, and data governance
- **Event Explorer**: Real-time event stream visualization for instrumentation QA and taxonomy exploration
- **User Lookup**: Individual user journey analysis and debugging
- **Instrumentation Explorer Chrome Plugin**: Browser-based event validation
- **Organization Settings**: Enterprise-level configuration for themes, sampling defaults, and access controls

The platform supports multiple data export mechanisms including REST APIs, CSV exports, and direct Snowflake querying through Amplitude SQL for advanced analysis.

## Technical Implementation Details

**Performance Optimization:**
- Automatic query time sampling with 10% user samples for large datasets
- Configurable caching intervals (realtime, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly)
- Data pruning mechanisms with result limits (100 single group-by, 500 dual group-by, 10,000 CSV export, 20,000 Dashboard REST API)

**Access Control:**
- Plan-based feature availability across Starter, Plus, Growth, and Enterprise tiers
- Role-based permissions for custom event creation (admin/manager/member)
- Organization-level theme and sampling configuration

**Advanced Features:**
- Cart analysis for e-commerce with object array support
- Historical count application for Event Segmentation
- Keyboard shortcuts for rapid chart creation (Shift+e, Shift+f, Shift+g)
- Custom color theming with 8-16 color palettes using hex values

The platform emphasizes real-time analysis capabilities while providing robust historical analysis tools, making it suitable for both operational monitoring and strategic product optimization initiatives.
