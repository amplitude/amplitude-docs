Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior through advanced event tracking, segmentation, and visualization capabilities. The platform provides a suite of 16+ specialized chart types designed to analyze different aspects of the user journey, from acquisition and engagement to retention and monetization.

## Core Chart Types and Relationships

The platform organizes its analytics capabilities into four primary use case categories:

**Know Your Users**: Event Segmentation serves as the foundational chart type for counting and filtering events, while User Sessions analyzes session-based behavior patterns. Data Tables provide multi-metric comparisons, and User Composition breaks down user properties.

**Convert Your Users**: Funnel Analysis tracks conversion rates and drop-off points across user journeys, while Journeys visualizes sequential user paths. Event Explorer offers real-time event stream monitoring for instrumentation validation.

**Retain Your Users**: Retention Analysis measures user return behavior, Stickiness charts analyze event frequency within intervals, and Lifecycle categorizes users as New, Current, Resurrected, or Dormant. Engagement Matrix plots feature usage by breadth and frequency.

**Monetize**: Revenue LTV analyzes lifetime value and monetization effectiveness, while Experiment Results provides A/B testing statistical analysis.

**Advanced Analytics**: Personas uses clustering to group similar user behaviors, Compass identifies behavioral thresholds that predict retention, and Impact Analysis measures how first-time feature engagement affects subsequent behaviors.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events Module**: The core component for selecting and configuring events, supporting default Amplitude events (Top Global Events, Any Active Event, New User), wildcard search with glob operators, and custom event grouping with OR logic.

**Segmentation Module**: Enables user segment creation and modification using user properties, behavioral cohorts, and various filter operators (is, contains, starts with, set operators, glob match) with OR/AND clause logic.

**Array Operators**: Specialized filtering operators including is/is not, contains/does not contain, set is/set is not, and set contains/set does not contain for handling array-type event properties.

**Group-by Functionality**: Categorizes events and users with automatic result pruning (100 values for single group-by, 500 for double group-by) and intelligent ordering by top activity.

**Cart Analysis**: Advanced feature for analyzing object arrays through property splitting, supporting cross-property, parallel, item match, and collection match filtering for e-commerce use cases.

**Query Time Sampling**: Performance optimization feature that analyzes 10% random user samples and up-samples results using inverse sampling methods.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The platform integrates deeply with Amplitude Data for property splitting and event instrumentation management. Charts connect seamlessly with dashboards and notebooks for collaborative analysis. The system supports saved user segments and behavioral cohorts that can be reused across different chart types.

Organization-level features include custom color theme management for Growth/Enterprise plans, project-wide sampling defaults, and role-based permissions (admin/manager/member) for custom event creation and data access.

## Technical Implementation

**API and Data Access**: Charts support CSV export functionality with limits (10,000 for exports, 20,000 for Dashboard REST API). The platform includes Amplitude SQL for direct Snowflake querying and integrates with the Instrumentation Explorer Chrome plugin.

**Performance Optimization**: The system implements intelligent caching based on query intervals (real-time, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly) and automatic data pruning to maintain chart performance while preserving analytical accuracy.

**Advanced Filtering**: Supports complex filtering scenarios including comma-separated property value pasting, inline behavioral cohort creation with the "+ Performed" feature, and historical count functionality in Event Segmentation charts.

The platform provides comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for efficient chart creation workflows and includes annotation and release tracking capabilities for contextualizing analytical insights within product development cycles.
