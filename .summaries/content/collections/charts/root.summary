Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior through sophisticated event tracking, segmentation, and visualization capabilities. The platform provides a rich ecosystem of chart types and analytical tools designed to help teams make data-driven decisions across the entire user lifecycle.

## Core Chart Types and Analytical Framework

The platform organizes its analytical capabilities around four primary use cases: knowing your users, converting users, retaining users, and monetizing users. The foundational chart types include:

**Event Segmentation** serves as the primary tool for counting and filtering events to understand user behavior patterns. **Funnel Analysis** focuses on conversion optimization by tracking user progression through sequential steps and identifying drop-off points. **Retention Analysis** measures how frequently users return to the product over time, while **User Sessions** provides session-based behavioral insights.

Advanced analytical capabilities include **Personas** for clustering users based on behavioral similarities, **Journeys** for analyzing user path sequences, **Engagement Matrix** for understanding feature engagement by breadth and frequency, and **Impact Analysis** for measuring how first-time feature engagement affects subsequent behaviors. Specialized charts like **Stickiness** measure event frequency within intervals, **Lifecycle** categorizes users as New, Current, Resurrected, or Dormant, and **Compass** identifies behavioral thresholds that predict retention.

## Event and User Segmentation Architecture

The platform's segmentation capabilities center around the **Events Module** and **Segmentation Module**. The Events Module handles event selection with support for default Amplitude events (Top Global Events, Any Active Event, New User), wildcard search functionality using glob operators, and custom event creation through OR logic grouping. Users can filter and group events using event properties and user properties.

The Segmentation Module provides sophisticated user categorization with support for active users, new users, and custom segments. It includes **Filter by clauses** and **Performed clauses** for behavioral cohorts, with advanced filtering using various operators (is, contains, starts with, set is, set contains, glob match). The module supports OR/AND clause logic and enables inline behavioral cohort creation through the "+ Performed" feature.

## Key Nomenclature and Operational Concepts

**Array Operators** form a critical component of the filtering system, including basic operators (is, is not, contains, does not contain) and set operators (set is, set is not, set contains, set does not contain). These operators enable precise event and property filtering with different semantic behaviors for cross-property versus parallel filtering.

**Cart Analysis** introduces specialized functionality for e-commerce analytics through object array analysis, utilizing property splitting with parent, child, and sibling property relationships. This enables sophisticated product performance analysis and conversion rate tracking by product type.

**Group-by functionality** provides data categorization with specific limits: 100 results for single group-by operations and 500 for double group-by operations. The system automatically prunes datasets and orders results by top activity within specified timeframes to maintain performance.

## Data Management and Performance Optimization

The platform implements **query time sampling** for performance optimization, analyzing 10% random user samples and up-sampling results using inverse sampling methods. This feature can be configured at individual chart, project-wide, or dashboard levels.

**Data Tables** provide comprehensive multi-metric analysis capabilities with breakdown table functionality for reviewing, sorting, filtering, and exporting underlying chart data. The system supports CSV exports with specific limits (10,000 for CSV export, 20,000 for Dashboard REST API).

## Advanced Features and Integrations

**Event Explorer** offers real-time event stream visualization, enabling users to view events and properties as they're triggered by specific users identified through IP address, user ID, device ID, or user properties. This tool supports taxonomy exploration and instrumentation QA.

**Experiment Results** charts provide A/B testing analysis with statistical significance testing, while **Revenue LTV** charts focus on monetization analytics and lifetime value calculations.

The platform includes sophisticated customization options through **chart color themes** with organization-level defaults for Growth/Enterprise plans, supporting 8-16 color custom themes using hex values or color picker interfaces.

## Technical Implementation Details

Chart caching operates on different intervals based on query types: real-time, hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly queries each have specific caching behaviors. The platform supports dual Y-axis functionality for event segmentation charts and provides comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for chart creation workflows.

The system integrates with **Amplitude Data** for property splitting setup and supports various API integrations including the Identify API with append() and set() methods for data manipulation. **Amplitude SQL** provides direct Snowflake querying capabilities for advanced users requiring custom analytical approaches.

Plan-based feature availability spans across Starter, Plus, Growth, and Enterprise tiers, with different chart types and advanced features accessible based on subscription level. The platform maintains comprehensive annotation and release tracking functionality for contextualizing analytical insights within product development cycles.
