## Product Architecture and Relationships

### Core Chart Types

1. **Event Segmentation**: Foundation chart for counting and filtering events
2. **Funnel Analysis**: Tracks conversion through defined event sequences
3. **Retention Analysis**: Measures recurring user engagement over time
4. **Data Tables**: Compares metrics across multiple dimensions in tabular format
5. **Journeys**: Analyzes sequential user paths through the product
6. **Experiment Results**: Evaluates A/B test outcomes with statistical significance
7. **Revenue LTV**: Tracks user lifetime value and monetization metrics
8. **Compass**: Identifies behavioral thresholds that predict retention
9. **Stickiness**: Measures frequency of specific event performance
10. **Personas**: Clusters users based on similar behavioral patterns
11. **Impact Analysis**: Correlates first-time engagement with subsequent behaviors
12. **User Sessions**: Analyzes session-based metrics and patterns
13. **Engagement Matrix**: Visualizes feature adoption by breadth and frequency
14. **Lifecycle**: Categorizes users as New, Current, Resurrected, or Dormant

### Supporting Components

## Key Terminology and Definitions

- **Events**: Tracked user actions within a product
- **User Segments**: Groups defined by properties or behaviors
- **Filter by Specification**: Conditions limiting which events are included
- **Group-by Specification**: Dimensions for segmenting chart data
- **Behavioral Cohorts**: User groups based on specific actions
- **Array Operators**:
  - **Equals**: Exact match for single value
  - **Set Contains**: Matches if array includes specified value
  - **Set Equals**: Matches if array contains exactly the specified values
- **Query Time Sampling**: Performance technique analyzing 10% of users
- **Object Arrays**: Structured format for complex data like shopping carts
- **Custom Events**: User-defined combinations of multiple events

## Ecosystem Integration
