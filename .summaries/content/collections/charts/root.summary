Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform designed to help organizations understand user behavior through data-driven insights. The platform provides 17+ specialized chart types organized into four strategic use cases: knowing users, converting users, retaining users, and monetizing users.

## Product Architecture and Chart Ecosystem

The platform's chart types form an interconnected ecosystem supporting the complete user analytics lifecycle:

**User Understanding Charts** include Event Segmentation for event counting and filtering, User Sessions for session-based analysis, Data Tables for multi-metric comparison, User Composition for user property analysis, and Event Explorer for real-time event monitoring.

**Conversion Analysis Charts** feature Funnel Analysis for tracking conversion rates, Journeys for mapping user paths, and Experiment Results for A/B testing outcomes.

**Retention Analysis Charts** encompass Retention Analysis for measuring return behavior, Lifecycle for categorizing users as New/Current/Resurrected/Dormant, Stickiness for measuring event frequency, and Impact Analysis for correlating feature engagement.

**Monetization Charts** include Revenue LTV for lifetime value analysis, Personas for behavioral clustering, Engagement Matrix for analyzing feature breadth versus frequency, and Compass for identifying behavioral thresholds.

## Core Platform Components

**Events Module** serves as the central component for event selection, supporting default Amplitude events (Top Global Events, Any Active Event, New User), wildcard search with glob operators, event filtering and grouping using event and user properties, and custom event creation through OR logic grouping.

**Segmentation Module** enables advanced user segment creation with support for multiple user categories (any users, active users, new users), complex filtering with user properties and behavioral cohorts, inline cohort creation via the "+ Performed" feature, and segment saving/reuse functionality.

**Measured As Module** provides various measurement options for quantifying events and user behavior across different chart types, allowing flexible metric calculation approaches.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** represent user actions tracked within applications, including both default Amplitude events and custom events defined by organizations.

**Cohorts** are user segments based on shared characteristics or behaviors, supporting both property-based and behavioral segmentation.

**Behavioral Cohorts** represent advanced user groupings based on specific behavioral patterns and event sequences.

**Cart Analysis** refers to object array analysis capabilities, particularly valuable for e-commerce analytics requiring property splitting setup.

**Query Time Sampling** involves using 10% random user samples with up-sampling via inverse sampling methods for performance optimization.

**Glob Operators** provide wildcard matching capabilities for flexible event and property filtering.

## Advanced Filtering and Query Capabilities

The platform implements sophisticated array operators including basic operators (is, is not, contains, does not contain), set operators (set is, set is not, set contains, set does not contain), advanced matching (glob match with wildcards, starts with, exact values, substring matching), and logical operators supporting OR/AND clause combinations for complex filtering scenarios.

## Performance Architecture and Data Management

**Caching System** employs tiered caching based on query intervals (real-time, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly) to optimize performance while maintaining data freshness.

**Data Limits** include CSV export limits (10,000 rows), Dashboard REST API limits (20,000 rows), and breakdown table restrictions to maintain system performance.

**Query Performance Optimization** includes automatic data pruning with limits of 100 values for single group-by operations and 500 for dual group-by operations.

## Integration Points and API Access

The platform supports multiple integration methods including dashboard integration, notebook integration, CSV downloads, and REST API access. Charts can be shared across teams and embedded in external systems. The Dashboard REST API provides programmatic access to chart data with specific row limits for performance management.

## Specialized Analysis Features

**Real-time Analysis** through Event Explorer provides live event stream visualization, enabling users to view events as they're triggered by specific users identified by IP address, user ID, device ID, or user properties.

**Cart Analysis** supports behavioral insights through object array analysis, requiring property splitting setup in Amplitude Data and supporting cross-property, parallel, item match, and collection match filtering.

**Instrumentation Explorer Chrome Plugin** provides specialized tools for development and QA workflows, facilitating proper event implementation and validation.

## Enterprise and Customization Features

**Color Themes** enable chart color customization with organization-level default themes available on Growth/Enterprise plans, supporting 8-16 colors per theme using hex values or color picker interfaces.

**Annotations and Releases** provide chart annotation systems for marking significant events and product releases.

**Plan-based Feature Access** varies across Starter, Plus, Growth, and Enterprise tiers, with advanced features like Personas, Compass, and Revenue LTV typically requiring higher-tier plans.

## Workflow and Usability Features

The platform includes keyboard shortcuts for efficient chart creation workflows, template systems for standardized analysis patterns, and the ability to save and reuse segments and cohorts across different analyses. The system processes both real-time and batched events with specific handling for different event types and exclusion rules for system events like Identify events.
