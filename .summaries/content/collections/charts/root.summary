Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior through sophisticated event tracking, segmentation, and visualization capabilities. The platform provides a rich ecosystem of chart types and analytical tools designed to help teams make data-driven decisions across the entire user lifecycle.

## Core Chart Types and Analytical Framework

The platform organizes its analytical capabilities around four primary use cases: Know Your Users, Convert Your Users, Retain Your Users, and Monetize. The foundational chart types include:

**Event Segmentation** serves as the primary tool for counting and filtering events to understand user behavior patterns. **Funnel Analysis** focuses on conversion optimization by tracking user progression through key event sequences and identifying drop-off points. **Retention Analysis** measures how frequently users return to the product over time, while **User Sessions** provides session-based behavioral insights.

Advanced analytical capabilities include **Personas** for clustering users based on behavioral similarities, **Journeys** for analyzing user path sequences, **Engagement Matrix** for understanding feature engagement by breadth and frequency, and **Impact Analysis** for measuring how first-time feature engagement affects subsequent behaviors. Specialized charts like **Stickiness** measure event frequency within intervals, **Lifecycle** categorizes users as New, Current, Resurrected, or Dormant, and **Compass** identifies behavioral thresholds that predict retention.

## Event and User Segmentation Architecture

The platform's segmentation capabilities center around the **Events Module** and **Segmentation Module**. The Events Module supports event selection including default Amplitude events (Top Global Events, Any Active Event, New User), wildcard search functionality with glob operators, and custom event creation through OR logic grouping. Users can filter and group events using event properties and user properties.

The Segmentation Module enables sophisticated user categorization through multiple user types (any users, active users, new users), complex filtering with user properties and behavioral cohorts, and segment grouping capabilities. The system supports **inline behavioral cohorts** through the "+ Performed" feature and allows saving segments for reuse across charts.

## Filtering and Operator System

Amplitude employs a comprehensive operator system for data filtering. **Array operators** include is/is not, contains/does not contain, and set-based operators (set is, set is not, set contains, set does not contain). The platform supports complex logical operations through OR/AND clause combinations and provides specialized operators like glob match for wildcard pattern matching.

**Cart analysis** functionality enables behavioral insights through object array analysis, particularly valuable for e-commerce applications. This requires property splitting setup in Amplitude Data and supports cross-property, parallel, item match, and collection match filtering capabilities.

## Data Management and Performance Optimization

The platform implements sophisticated **query time sampling** using 10% random user samples with up-sampling through inverse sampling methods to optimize performance. **Data pruning** automatically limits results to 100 values for single group-by operations and 500 for dual group-by operations, ordering results by top activity within specified timeframes.

**Chart caching** operates on different intervals based on query types: real-time, hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly queries each have specific cache durations. The system supports CSV exports with 10,000 row limits and Dashboard REST API access with 20,000 row limits.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Active Events** refer to events that have been triggered within the selected time range, while **behavioral cohorts** are user groups defined by specific action sequences. **Property splitting** enables analysis of nested object arrays by creating parent, child, and sibling property relationships. **Group-by clauses** allow data breakdown by property values with automatic pruning when limits are exceeded.

**User properties** define user characteristics, while **event properties** capture specific event attributes. **Segments** represent filtered user groups that can be saved and reused across charts. **Inline cohorts** are behavioral segments created directly within chart building workflows.

## Integration and Ecosystem

The platform integrates with **Amplitude Data** for property splitting configuration and supports the **Identify API** for user property management. **Event Explorer** provides real-time event stream visualization for taxonomy exploration and instrumentation QA. The **Instrumentation Explorer Chrome plugin** extends debugging capabilities.

Chart customization includes **color theme management** at organization and chart levels, **dual Y-axis** support for event segmentation, custom legend labels, and annotation capabilities. The platform supports **keyboard shortcuts** for efficient chart creation workflows and provides **breakdown tables** for detailed data analysis with sorting, filtering, and export capabilities.

Revenue analysis capabilities through **Revenue LTV** charts enable lifetime value calculations and monetization insights. **Experiment Results** charts provide A/B testing analysis with statistical significance testing. **Data Tables** offer multi-metric comparison capabilities in unified views.

The platform operates on a tiered access model with Starter, Plus, Growth, and Enterprise plans providing different levels of chart type access and advanced features like organization-level theme management and enhanced sampling controls.
