Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior through sophisticated event tracking, segmentation, and visualization capabilities. The platform provides a suite of 16+ specialized chart types designed to answer different analytical questions about user engagement, conversion, retention, and monetization.

## Core Chart Types and Relationships

The platform organizes its analytical capabilities into four primary use case categories:

**Know Your Users**: Event Segmentation serves as the foundational chart type for counting and filtering events, while User Sessions analyzes session-based behavior patterns. Data Tables provide multi-metric comparisons, and User Composition breaks down user properties.

**Convert Your Users**: Funnel Analysis tracks conversion rates and drop-off points across user journeys. Journeys visualizes user path sequences, while Experiment Results provides A/B testing statistical analysis.

**Retain Your Users**: Retention Analysis measures user return behavior, Stickiness analyzes event frequency within intervals, and Lifecycle categorizes users as New, Current, Resurrected, or Dormant.

**Monetize**: Revenue LTV calculates lifetime value metrics for monetization analysis.

**Advanced Analytics**: Personas uses clustering to group similar user behaviors, Engagement Matrix plots feature breadth vs. frequency, Impact Analysis measures feature interaction effects, and Compass identifies behavioral thresholds that predict retention.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events Module**: The core component for selecting and configuring events, supporting default Amplitude events (Top Global Events, Any Active Event, New User), wildcard search with glob operators, and custom event grouping with OR logic.

**Segmentation Module**: Handles user categorization with support for active users, new users, behavioral cohorts, and complex filtering using user properties. Features inline cohort creation with the "+ Performed" functionality.

**Array Operators**: A comprehensive set of filtering operators including basic operators (is, is not, contains, does not contain) and set operators (set is, set is not, set contains, set does not contain) for handling array data structures.

**Group-by Functionality**: Enables event categorization with automatic result pruning (100 values for single group-by, 500 for double group-by) and intelligent ordering by top activity within specified timeframes.

**Cart Analysis**: Specialized feature for e-commerce analytics using object arrays with property splitting, supporting both cross-property and parallel filtering semantics for analyzing shopping cart behaviors.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Analytics integrates deeply with the broader Amplitude ecosystem through several key touchpoints:

**Amplitude Data**: Provides the foundational data layer with property splitting configuration for cart analysis and event instrumentation management.

**Real-time Tools**: Event Explorer offers live event stream visualization for taxonomy exploration and instrumentation QA, while the Instrumentation Explorer Chrome plugin extends debugging capabilities.

**API Integration**: The platform supports the Identify API with append() and set() methods for user property management, and provides REST API access with specific caching and export limitations.

**Enterprise Features**: Advanced capabilities include organization-level chart color theme management, Monitors for automated alerting, and enhanced collaboration features across Growth and Enterprise tiers.

## Technical Implementation Details

**Performance Optimization**: The platform implements query time sampling using 10% random user samples with inverse sampling methods for up-scaling results. Chart caching varies by time interval (realtime, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly) with different durations for standalone charts versus dashboards and API calls.

**Data Export**: CSV export capabilities with 10,000 row limits for individual charts and 20,000 row limits for Dashboard REST API calls.

**Filtering Logic**: Sophisticated filtering supports OR/AND clause combinations, exact values, substring matching, prefix strings, array sets, and wildcard matching with glob operators.

**User Lookup**: Integration with User Lookup functionality enables targeting by IP address, user ID, device ID, and user properties for detailed behavioral analysis.

The platform's modular architecture allows these components to work together seamlessly, enabling users to build complex analytical workflows that span from basic event counting to advanced behavioral prediction and monetization analysis.
