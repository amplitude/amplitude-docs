Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior through sophisticated event tracking, segmentation, and visualization capabilities. The platform provides a rich ecosystem of chart types and analytical tools designed to help teams make data-driven decisions across the entire user lifecycle.

## Core Chart Types and Analytical Framework

The platform centers around 16 primary chart types organized into four strategic categories that align with the customer lifecycle:

**Know Your Users**: Event Segmentation for counting and filtering events, User Sessions for session-based analysis, Data Tables for multi-metric comparisons, User Composition for demographic breakdowns, and Event Explorer for real-time event stream monitoring.

**Convert Your Users**: Funnel Analysis for conversion tracking, Journeys for user path analysis, and Experiment Results for A/B testing statistical analysis.

**Retain Your Users**: Retention Analysis for return behavior measurement, Stickiness for event frequency analysis, Lifecycle for user categorization (New, Current, Resurrected, Dormant), and Engagement Matrix for feature breadth and frequency analysis.

**Monetize**: Revenue LTV for lifetime value calculations, Impact Analysis for feature correlation studies, Personas for behavioral clustering, and Compass for identifying behavioral thresholds that predict retention.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

The chart types work synergistically within Amplitude's analytical framework. Event Segmentation serves as the foundational chart type, providing core event counting and filtering capabilities that inform other analyses. Funnel Analysis builds upon segmentation to track conversion flows, while Retention Analysis uses similar event-based logic to measure user return behavior.

The platform's segmentation capabilities form the backbone of most analyses, with the Events module supporting wildcard search using glob operators, default Amplitude events (Top Global Events, Any Active Event, New User), and custom event grouping with OR logic. The Segmentation Module enables complex user filtering through user properties, behavioral cohorts, and inline cohort creation using the "+ Performed" feature.

Advanced charts like Personas and Compass represent higher-order analytics that synthesize data from multiple sources to provide strategic insights. These are restricted to higher-tier plans (Growth and Enterprise) and integrate with the broader Amplitude ecosystem for comprehensive user understanding.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events**: Trackable user actions that form the basis of all analysis, including both custom instrumented events and default Amplitude events. Events support wildcard matching and can be grouped using OR logic.

**User Segments**: Defined groups of users based on properties, behaviors, or cohort membership, supporting both active and new user categorizations with complex filtering through array operators.

**Properties**: Attributes associated with events (event properties) or users (user properties) that enable detailed filtering and grouping. Properties support array operators including is, is not, contains, does not contain, set is, set is not, set contains, and set does not contain.

**Cohorts**: Groups of users defined by shared characteristics or behaviors, including behavioral cohorts created through the "+ Performed" functionality for inline cohort creation.

**Group-by**: Categorization mechanism for breaking down data by specific dimensions, with support for single and dual group-by operations. The system implements automatic pruning (100 values for single group-by, 500 for dual group-by).

**Array Operators**: Specialized filtering operators designed for handling array-type data, including set operations and containment checks, particularly useful for cart analysis scenarios.

**Sampling**: Performance optimization technique using statistical sampling (10% user sample) with inverse sampling methods for result extrapolation, configurable at organization and chart levels.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Analytics integrates deeply with the broader Amplitude ecosystem through several key touchpoints:

**Amplitude Data**: Provides the foundational data infrastructure, including property splitting setup required for cart analysis and object array processing. This integration enables sophisticated e-commerce analysis through nested product attributes.

**User Lookup**: Integrates with Event Explorer for real-time user targeting and event stream analysis, enabling immediate user behavior investigation.

**Instrumentation Explorer Chrome Plugin**: Extends Event Explorer capabilities for real-time instrumentation quality assurance, ensuring data quality at the point of collection.

**Dashboard and Notebook Integration**: Charts can be shared and embedded across Amplitude's collaborative features, with dashboard-level sampling controls and organization-wide theme management supporting team-based analytics workflows.

**API Integration**: The platform supports programmatic access through CSV exports (10,000 row limits) and Dashboard REST API access (20,000 row limits) for integration with external systems and automated reporting.

## Technical Implementation and Configuration

The platform implements intelligent data management through query time sampling and chart caching that operates on different intervals (real-time, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly) based on query complexity. This ensures optimal performance while maintaining data accuracy.

Advanced configuration options include organization-level settings for Growth and Enterprise plans, with default chart color themes using 8-16 color palettes defined by hex values. Project administrators can configure query time sampling defaults, while individual charts support custom legend labels, dual Y-axis configurations, and annotations/releases functionality.

Chart interaction capabilities include keyboard shortcuts for workflow optimization, breakdown table functionality for data review and export, and template-based chart creation for standardized analysis patterns. The system maintains plan-based feature availability across Starter, Plus, Growth, and Enterprise tiers, with advanced features like Personas clustering and Compass behavioral analysis restricted to higher-tier plans.

The platform's architecture supports complex analytical workflows through features like cart analysis for object arrays, property splitting for nested data structures, and sophisticated filtering mechanisms that enable deep user behavior analysis across the entire customer lifecycle.
