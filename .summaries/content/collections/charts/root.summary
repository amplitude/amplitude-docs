# Amplitude Charts: Product Overview

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude Charts is a comprehensive analytics platform for visualizing and analyzing user behavior data. The platform provides various chart types organized around key business objectives: understanding users, improving conversion, enhancing retention, and optimizing monetization. These visualization tools help product teams gain insights into user engagement patterns, conversion funnels, retention metrics, and revenue performance.

The platform supports multiple analysis methodologies through specialized chart types, from basic event counting with Event Segmentation to advanced behavioral clustering with Personas and impact measurement with Impact Analysis.

## Product Relationships and Features

Amplitude Charts consists of several interconnected chart types categorized by analytical purpose:

### Core Analysis Charts
- **Event Segmentation**: The foundational chart type for counting and filtering events to understand basic user behavior
- **Funnel Analysis**: Tracks conversion rates and drop-offs between sequential events
- **Retention Analysis**: Measures how frequently users return to the product over time
- **Data Tables**: Provides comparative breakdowns of events and metrics in tabular format

### User Journey Charts
- **Journeys**: Analyzes the sequences and paths users take through the product
- **User Sessions**: Examines session-based metrics and behavior patterns

### Advanced Analysis Charts
- **Revenue LTV**: Tracks user monetization metrics over their lifetime
- **Compass**: Identifies behavioral thresholds that predict retention
- **Stickiness**: Measures frequency of specific user actions
- **Personas**: Clusters users based on similar behavioral patterns
- **Impact Analysis**: Evaluates how engagement with one feature affects other behaviors
- **Engagement Matrix**: Visualizes feature adoption by breadth and frequency
- **Lifecycle**: Categorizes users as New, Current, Resurrected, or Dormant

### Experimental Analysis
- **Experiment Results**: Analyzes A/B test outcomes for statistical significance

### Advanced Query Options
- **SQL-based Charts**: Enables direct Snowflake querying for custom analytics

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Events Module**: Component for selecting and configuring events to analyze
2. **Segmentation Module**: Tool for defining user segments based on properties or behaviors
3. **Group-by**: Feature for categorizing events by properties (limited to 100 values for single group-by, 500 for double group-by)
4. **Filter by specification**: Conditions applied to refine event analysis
5. **Array operators**: Tools for analyzing array data (equals, set contains, set equals)
6. **Behavioral cohorts**: User segments defined by specific actions or behaviors
7. **Query time sampling**: Performance optimization that analyzes a 10% random user sample
8. **Object arrays**: Data structure for analyzing complex nested data
9. **Property splitting**: Technique for analyzing child properties within parent properties
10. **Breakdown table**: Interactive data visualization showing sortable chart results

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Charts integrates with the broader Amplitude Analytics ecosystem through:

1. **Dashboard Integration**: Charts can be saved to dashboards for monitoring and sharing
2. **Annotations and Releases**: Support for marking significant events or product releases
3. **Experiment Integration**: Direct connection to experiment results
4. **Data Export**: Results exportable via CSV or accessible through the Dashboard REST API
5. **Customization Options**: Organization-level chart theme customization
6. **Event Explorer**: Real-time event stream visualization for identifying relevant events
