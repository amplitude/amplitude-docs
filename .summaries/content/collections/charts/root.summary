# Amplitude Charts: Product Overview

Amplitude Charts is a comprehensive analytics platform for visualizing and analyzing user behavior data. It provides diverse chart types designed for specific analytical needs across the user journey, helping organizations understand behavior patterns, measure conversion, track retention, and optimize monetization strategies.

## Key Features and Capabilities

- Multiple specialized chart types organized by analytical purpose
- Advanced segmentation for targeted user analysis
- Customizable visualizations with color themes and formatting options
- Real-time event exploration and verification
- Performance optimization for large datasets
- Integration with the broader Amplitude ecosystem

## Product Organization and Chart Types

Amplitude Charts are organized into five main categories based on analytical purpose:

### 1. Know Your Users
- **Event Segmentation**: Count and filter events to understand user behavior
- **Data Tables**: Compare and break down events and metrics in a single view
- **User Composition**: Analyze user demographics and properties
- **User Sessions**: Count and filter sessions to understand user behavior

### 2. Convert Users
- **Funnel Analysis**: Understand conversion and drop-off for key events
- **Journeys**: Analyze sequences of steps taken by users
- **Experiment Results**: Find statistically significant outcomes of A/B tests

### 3. Retain Users
- **Retention Analysis**: Analyze how often users return to the product
- **Stickiness**: Measure how often users perform events in specific intervals
- **Compass**: Find thresholds of user behavior that predict retention
- **Lifecycle**: Break down user base by New, Current, Resurrected, and Dormant Users

### 4. Monetize
- **Revenue LTV**: Learn how well users are being monetized
- **Impact Analysis**: Understand how first-time engagement affects other behaviors
- **Engagement Matrix**: Understand overall feature engagement by breadth and frequency
- **Personas**: Determine clusters of users that behave similarly

### 5. Other Capabilities
- **SQL-based analysis**: Direct querying of Snowflake databases
- **Legacy Charts**: Access to previous chart implementations

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Core Components
- **Events Module**: Component for selecting and configuring events to analyze in charts
- **Segmentation Module**: Component for defining and refining user segments based on properties or behaviors
- **Group-by**: Feature that categorizes events by specified properties (limits: 100 values for single group-by, 500 for double group-by)

### Data Analysis Features
- **Array Operators**:
  - Equals/Does not equal: Exact matching
  - Set contains/Set does not contain: Partial matching
  - Set equals/Set does not equal: Complete matching

- **Cart Analysis**: Feature for analyzing object arrays (e-commerce focus)
  - Property splitting: Breaking down object arrays into parent and child properties
  - Cross-property filters: Filtering across different properties
  - Parallel filters: Applying multiple filters simultaneously

- **Query Time Sampling**: Performance optimization that analyzes a 10% random sample of users and extrapolates results

- **Breakdown Table**: Interactive data table showing chart results with sorting, filtering, and export capabilities

- **Custom Events**: User-created event groups that combine multiple events with an OR relationship

## Integration with Amplitude Ecosystem

Amplitude Charts integrates with other Amplitude products and features:

1. **Dashboards**: Charts can be added to dashboards for monitoring and sharing
2. **Behavioral Cohorts**: User segments defined by behavior patterns can be used across charts
3. **Annotations and Releases**: Charts can display markers for significant events or product releases
4. **Experiment Framework**: Integration with Amplitude's experimentation tools for A/B test analysis
5. **Data Export**: Chart data can be exported via CSV or accessed through the Dashboard REST API
