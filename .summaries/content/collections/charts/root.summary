Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior through advanced event tracking, segmentation, and visualization capabilities. The platform provides a suite of specialized chart types and analytical tools designed to help businesses optimize user acquisition, conversion, retention, and monetization strategies.

## Core Chart Types and Analytical Capabilities

The platform centers around 16 primary chart types organized into four strategic categories:

**User Understanding Charts:**
- **Event Segmentation**: The foundational chart type for counting and filtering events to understand user behavior patterns
- **Data Tables**: Multi-metric comparison and breakdown analysis in tabular format
- **User Sessions**: Session-based analysis for understanding user engagement patterns
- **Event Explorer**: Real-time event stream visualization for taxonomy exploration and instrumentation QA

**Conversion Analysis Charts:**
- **Funnel Analysis**: Multi-step conversion analysis with drop-off identification
- **Journeys**: Sequential user path analysis and behavior flow mapping
- **Experiment Results**: A/B testing statistical significance analysis

**Retention and Engagement Charts:**
- **Retention Analysis**: User return behavior and cohort-based retention tracking
- **Lifecycle**: User categorization into New, Current, Resurrected, and Dormant segments
- **Stickiness**: Event frequency analysis within specified intervals
- **Engagement Matrix**: Feature engagement analysis by breadth and frequency

**Advanced Analytics Charts:**
- **Personas**: Machine learning-based user clustering and behavioral segmentation
- **Impact Analysis**: Feature interaction and cross-behavior influence measurement
- **Compass**: Behavioral threshold identification for retention prediction
- **Revenue LTV**: Lifetime value and monetization analysis

## Key Platform Components and Architecture

**Events Module**: The core data input system supporting default Amplitude events (Top Global Events, Any Active Event, New User), custom event creation with OR logic grouping, and wildcard search functionality using glob operators. Events can be filtered and grouped using event properties and user properties.

**Segmentation Module**: Advanced user targeting system supporting multiple user categories (any users, active users, new users), complex filtering with behavioral cohorts, and inline cohort creation through the "+ Performed" feature. Supports saving and reusing segments across charts.

**Property System**: Comprehensive property management including user properties, event properties, and specialized cart analysis capabilities for object arrays. Supports property splitting in Amplitude Data for e-commerce analytics with cross-property, parallel, item match, and collection match filtering.

## Advanced Filtering and Operator System

The platform employs sophisticated filtering capabilities through multiple operator types:

**Array Operators**: is, is not, contains, does not contain, set is, set is not, set contains, set does not contain for precise event and property filtering.

**Filter Logic**: Complex AND/OR clause combinations for building nuanced user segments and event filters.

**Specialized Operators**: glob match for wildcard pattern matching, starts with for prefix matching, and various set operators for array-based property analysis.

## Performance Optimization and Data Management

**Query Time Sampling**: Automatic performance optimization using 10% random user sampling with inverse sampling up-scaling, configurable at chart, project, and dashboard levels.

**Data Pruning**: Automatic dataset limitation to 100 values for single group-by operations and 500 for dual group-by operations, with intelligent ordering by top activity within specified timeframes.

**Caching System**: Tiered caching based on query intervals (real-time, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly) to optimize performance while maintaining data freshness.

## Integration and Workflow Features

**Chart Customization**: Comprehensive theming system with organization-level defaults, custom color themes (8-16 colors), dual Y-axis support for event segmentation, and custom legend labeling.

**Data Export**: CSV export capabilities with limits (10,000 for standard export, 20,000 for Dashboard REST API), breakdown table functionality for data review and analysis.

**Collaboration Tools**: Chart sharing, dashboard integration, notebook integration, annotations and releases functionality, and keyboard shortcuts for efficient workflow management.

**Real-time Capabilities**: Event Explorer provides real-time event stream visualization with user targeting by IP address, user ID, device ID, or user properties, enabling immediate instrumentation validation and taxonomy exploration.

## Enterprise and Plan-Based Features

The platform operates on a tiered access model (Starter, Plus, Growth, Enterprise) with advanced features like organization-level theme management, enhanced sampling controls, and specialized analytics capabilities distributed across plan levels. Growth and Enterprise plans include advanced customization options and administrative controls for large-scale deployments.

The platform integrates with external systems through APIs, supports Chrome plugin integration for instrumentation exploration, and provides comprehensive data management through Amplitude Data for property splitting and advanced e-commerce analytics workflows.
