   - **Retention Charts**: Retention Analysis, Stickiness, Lifecycle
   - **Behavioral Analysis Charts**: Compass, Impact Analysis, Personas
   - **E-commerce Charts**: Cart Analysis, Revenue LTV
   - **Experimental Charts**: Experiment Results

2. **Segmentation Module**: Enables precise user targeting through:
   - User categories (any users, active users, new users)
   - Property-based filters with various operators
   - Behavioral cohorts
   - Custom groupings

3. **Events Module**: Handles selection and manipulation of event data with:
   - Event property filtering
   - Group-by specifications
   - Wildcard searches
   - Custom event creation through grouping

4. **Data Processing Layer**: Manages data pruning, ordering, and optimization for chart responsiveness

5. **Snowflake Integration**: Amplitude SQL for direct querying of Snowflake data

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Events**: User actions tracked in the product (e.g., clicks, page views, purchases)
- **Event Properties**: Attributes providing additional context for events
- **User Segments**: Subsets of users defined by specific criteria or behaviors
- **Behavioral Cohorts**: Groups of users who performed specific actions or sequences
- **Array Operators**: Logical operators for filtering array properties:
  - **Equals**: Exact match of values
  - **Set Contains**: Array contains specified value(s)
  - **Set Equals**: Array contains exactly the specified values
  - Negative versions of each operator
- **Group-by**: Functionality categorizing events by properties (limits: 100 values for single, 500 for double)
- **User Lifecycle Categories**:
  - **New Users**: First-time users in current time period
  - **Current Users**: Active in both current and previous periods
  - **Resurrected Users**: Active in current period after dormancy
  - **Dormant Users**: Active in previous period but not current
- **Query Time Sampling**: Performance technique analyzing 10% of users' events and extrapolating
- **Object Arrays**: Data structures representing collections of items with properties
- **Breakdown Table**: Tabular view of chart data for sorting, filtering, and exporting

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Analytics integrates with the broader ecosystem through:

1. **Dashboard Integration**: Charts can be added to dashboards for monitoring and sharing
2. **Team Collaboration**: Segments, cohorts, and analyses can be saved and shared
