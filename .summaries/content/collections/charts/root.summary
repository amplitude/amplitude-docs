Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform designed to help organizations understand user behavior through sophisticated event tracking, segmentation, and advanced analytics capabilities. The platform serves as a complete solution for data-driven decision making across the entire user lifecycle, from acquisition through monetization.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform is built around four primary analytical use cases, each supported by specialized chart types and analytical tools:

**User Understanding** centers on Event Segmentation charts for counting and filtering events, Data Tables for multi-metric comparisons, User Sessions for session-based analysis, and Event Explorer for real-time event stream visualization and instrumentation QA.

**Conversion Optimization** provides Funnel Analysis for tracking conversion rates through multi-step processes, Journeys for comprehensive user path analysis, and Experiment Results charts for statistical analysis of A/B testing outcomes.

**Retention Analysis** includes dedicated Retention charts for measuring return behavior, Lifecycle charts for categorizing users (New, Current, Resurrected, Dormant), Stickiness analysis for measuring event frequency patterns, and Compass charts for identifying behavioral thresholds that predict long-term retention.

**Monetization Analytics** encompasses Revenue LTV charts for lifetime value analysis, Impact Analysis for correlating feature engagement with business outcomes, Engagement Matrix for analyzing feature breadth and frequency, and Personas for behavioral clustering and segmentation.

## Key Platform Modules and Components

The **Events Module** serves as the central component for event selection and configuration, supporting Amplitude's default events (Top Global Events, Any Active Event, New User), wildcard search functionality with glob operators, custom event grouping using OR logic, and comprehensive event property filtering. Events are added to charts through the standardized "Add Event or Metric" interface.

The **Segmentation Module** provides advanced user targeting capabilities supporting multiple user categories (any users, active users, new users), complex filtering using user properties and behavioral cohorts, inline cohort creation through the "+ Performed" feature, and segment saving and reuse functionality across analyses.

The **Measured As Module** offers different measurement options for events and metrics within charts, allowing for flexible data interpretation and analysis approaches.

## Core Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Array Operators** provide comprehensive filtering capabilities including basic operators (is, is not, contains, does not contain) and advanced set operators (set is, set is not, set contains, set does not contain) for precise event and property filtering.

**Filter Operators** extend beyond basic matching to include exact matching (is), substring matching (contains), prefix matching (starts with), array set operations, and wildcard matching (glob match) with support for complex OR/AND clause logic.

**User Properties vs Event Properties** represent the fundamental distinction between attributes associated with users (demographic, account-level data) versus attributes associated with specific events (contextual, behavioral data), both usable for filtering and segmentation.

**Behavioral Cohorts** are user groups defined by specific behavioral patterns that can be created inline within charts or saved for reuse across multiple analyses, enabling sophisticated user segmentation strategies.

**Group-by Functionality** enables result breakdown by property values with specific performance limits (100 values for single group-by, 500 for dual group-by) and automatic pruning when limits are exceeded to maintain query performance.

## Advanced Analytics Features

**Cart Analysis** provides specialized e-commerce analytics supporting object arrays through property splitting, enabling detailed shopping cart flow analysis with cross-property, parallel, item match, and collection match filtering options (available in Growth and Enterprise plans).

**Query Performance Optimization** includes built-in sampling that analyzes 10% random user samples and up-samples results using inverse sampling methods, configurable at both chart and project levels to balance accuracy with performance.

**Real-time Capabilities** through Event Explorer provide live event stream visualization with user targeting by IP address, user ID, device ID, or user properties, primarily used for instrumentation QA and taxonomy exploration.

## Data Integration and Export Capabilities

The platform supports CSV export functionality with 10,000 row limits, Dashboard REST API access with 20,000 result limits, breakdown tables for detailed data review and analysis, and integration with dashboards and notebooks for comprehensive reporting workflows.

## Chart Customization and Management

**Visual Customization** includes a chart color theme system supporting custom themes with 8-16 colors using hex values, organization-level default themes for Growth/Enterprise plans, and Y-axis customization including dual Y-axis support for event segmentation charts.

**Chart Operations** encompass comprehensive sharing capabilities, custom legend labels, annotations and releases functionality for marking significant events, keyboard shortcuts for workflow optimization, and intelligent chart caching with different intervals (real-time, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly) based on query complexity and requirements.

**Data Management** features automatic data pruning and ordering by top activity within specified timeframes, breakdown table functionality for sorting, filtering, and detailed data review, and series selection capabilities for focused analysis.

## Platform Architecture and Access Control

The platform implements **Plan-based Feature Access** with tiered availability across Starter, Plus, Growth, and Enterprise plans, where advanced features like cart analysis, custom color themes, and organization-level settings are restricted to higher-tier plans.

**User Permissions** follow role-based access control with admin/manager/member permissions that affect chart creation capabilities and data access levels throughout the platform.

**Performance Limits** include built-in query limits and result restrictions designed to maintain platform performance, including group-by limits, CSV export limits, and API access limits.

The platform integrates with external tools through comprehensive APIs and supports advanced SQL querying capabilities for direct Snowflake access, positioning Amplitude Analytics as an enterprise-grade solution for comprehensive user behavior analysis and product optimization across organizations of all sizes.
