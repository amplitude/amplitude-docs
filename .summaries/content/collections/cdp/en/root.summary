## Amplitude CDP (Customer Data Platform)

Amplitude CDP is a comprehensive customer data platform that enables organizations to collect, process, and activate customer data across multiple touchpoints. The platform serves as a central hub for data ingestion, transformation, and distribution to various downstream systems and applications.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Amplitude CDP consists of three core components that work together to create a complete data activation pipeline:

**Sources** serve as the data ingestion layer, collecting customer behavioral data from various touchpoints and applications. This data forms the foundation for all downstream processing and activation.

**Audiences** represents the segmentation and personalization engine, powered by Amplitude Activation's self-serve platform. This component transforms raw behavioral data into actionable customer segments through:
- Behavioral and predictive cohorts based on user actions and patterns
- Computations that generate computed user properties for enhanced segmentation
- AutoML-powered predictions that calculate percentile likelihood scores for predictive goals
- Recommendation engines for personalized content delivery

**Destinations** function as the data export and activation layer, enabling seamless integration with third-party platforms through a modal-based configuration workflow accessible via the Connections section.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Cohorts**: Segmented groups of users based on shared behavioral patterns or predictive characteristics
- *Behavioral cohorts*: Segments based on historical user actions and engagement patterns
- *Predictive cohorts*: Forward-looking segments created using machine learning models

**Computations**: Calculated metrics that derive new user properties from existing behavioral data, enabling more sophisticated segmentation

**Predictions**: AutoML-generated models that assign percentile likelihood scores to users for achieving specific predictive goals

**Syncs**: Data delivery mechanisms that enable real-time or batch data transfer to external systems
- *Real-time syncs*: Immediate data delivery for time-sensitive use cases
- *Automated syncs*: Scheduled batch transfers for regular data updates
- *On-demand syncs*: Manual data exports triggered by user action

**UserID Export**: The process of extracting specific user identifiers for targeted campaigns or analysis

## Ecosystem Integration and APIs

The Amplitude CDP integrates into the broader Amplitude ecosystem through multiple API endpoints and data interfaces:

**Cohorts API**: Enables programmatic access to audience segments for external applications and marketing platforms

**Profile API**: Provides real-time access to individual user profiles and computed properties

The platform supports destination syncing to various third-party platforms through the Connections interface, allowing organizations to activate their segmented audiences across their entire marketing and product technology stack.

## Business Impact and Use Cases

The platform is designed to deliver measurable business outcomes, with documented conversion lift improvements of 15-30% through 1:1 personalization capabilities. Primary use cases include:
- Real-time audience segmentation for marketing campaigns
- Predictive modeling for customer lifecycle optimization
- Cross-platform data synchronization for unified customer experiences
- Automated personalization based on behavioral patterns and predictions

The self-serve nature of the platform enables both technical and non-technical users to create sophisticated audience segments and activate them across multiple channels without requiring extensive engineering resources.
