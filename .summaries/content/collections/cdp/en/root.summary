## Amplitude CDP (Customer Data Platform)

Amplitude CDP is a comprehensive customer data platform that enables organizations to collect, process, and activate customer data for personalized experiences and improved conversion rates. The platform combines data ingestion, audience segmentation, and multi-channel activation capabilities to deliver 1:1 personalization with reported conversion lifts of 15-30%.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Amplitude CDP consists of three core components that work together in a unified data pipeline:

**Sources** serve as the data ingestion layer, collecting customer behavioral data and feeding it into the platform for processing and analysis.

**Audiences** represent the segmentation and intelligence engine, powered by Amplitude Activation's self-serve personalization platform. This component transforms raw data into actionable customer segments through:
- Behavioral cohorts based on user actions and engagement patterns
- Predictive cohorts leveraging AutoML for future behavior prediction
- Computations for custom audience definitions and metrics
- Predictions and recommendations engines for personalized content delivery

**Destinations** function as the activation layer, enabling data export and synchronization with third-party platforms through the Connections section interface.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Cohorts**: User segments defined by shared behavioral characteristics or predicted attributes
- *Behavioral cohorts*: Groups based on historical user actions and engagement patterns
- *Predictive cohorts*: Segments created using machine learning to forecast future behaviors

**Computations**: Custom calculations and metrics applied to user data for advanced segmentation

**Predictions**: AutoML-powered forecasting capabilities that anticipate user behavior and preferences

**Recommendations**: Personalized content and product suggestions generated through machine learning algorithms

**Syncs**: Data synchronization mechanisms available in multiple modes:
- *On-demand syncs*: Manual data exports triggered by users
- *Automated syncs*: Scheduled data transfers
- *Real-time syncs*: Continuous data streaming for immediate activation

**Predictive Goals**: Target outcomes defined for machine learning models to optimize toward specific business objectives

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude CDP integrates with the broader Amplitude ecosystem through Amplitude Data, which provides the underlying data infrastructure and analytics capabilities. The platform connects to external systems through:

- **Third-party destination syncs** for marketing automation, advertising platforms, and customer engagement tools
- **API-based integrations** enabling programmatic access to customer data and segments
- **Real-time data streaming** for immediate personalization and activation across touchpoints

## API Endpoints and Technical Interfaces

The platform provides two primary APIs for data access and activation:

**Cohorts API**: Enables programmatic access to audience segments and cohort definitions for integration with external systems

**Profile API**: Provides individual customer profile data and attributes for real-time personalization use cases

The Destinations configuration is managed through the **Connections section** interface, where users access the **Destinations tab** and utilize **Add Destination** functionality with destination-specific configuration modals for setting up data export parameters.
