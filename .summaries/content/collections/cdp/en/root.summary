## Amplitude CDP (Customer Data Platform)

Amplitude CDP is a comprehensive customer data platform that enables organizations to collect, process, and activate customer data across multiple touchpoints. The platform serves as a central hub for data ingestion, transformation, and distribution to support personalized customer experiences and data-driven decision making.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Amplitude CDP consists of three core components that work together to create a complete data activation pipeline:

**Sources** serve as the data ingestion layer, collecting customer data from various touchpoints and channels. This data flows into the platform where it becomes available for segmentation and analysis.

**Audiences** represents the segmentation and personalization engine, powered by Amplitude Activation. This component transforms raw data into actionable customer segments through behavioral cohorts, predictive cohorts, and computations. The audience engine leverages AutoML capabilities to generate predictions and recommendations that enable 1:1 personalization.

**Destinations** function as the data activation layer, enabling the export and synchronization of processed data and audience segments to third-party platforms and external systems for campaign execution and personalization delivery.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Behavioral Cohorts**: Customer segments created based on observed user actions and engagement patterns within the platform.

**Predictive Cohorts**: Forward-looking customer segments generated using machine learning models to identify users likely to perform specific actions or exhibit certain behaviors.

**Computations**: Data processing operations that transform raw customer data into meaningful metrics and derived attributes.

**Predictions**: AutoML-generated forecasts about customer behavior, enabling proactive personalization and targeting strategies.

**Cohort Syncs**: The mechanism for delivering audience segments to external platforms, available in three modes:
- On-demand syncs for immediate data transfer
- Automated syncs for scheduled regular updates  
- Real-time syncs for continuous data streaming

**Predictive Goals**: Specific business outcomes or user behaviors that the platform optimizes for when generating predictive cohorts and recommendations.

## API and Integration Capabilities

The platform provides programmatic access through two primary APIs:

**Cohorts API**: Enables external systems to retrieve audience segment definitions and membership data, facilitating integration with marketing automation and campaign management tools.

**Profile API**: Provides access to individual customer profiles and attributes, supporting real-time personalization use cases and customer service applications.

## Ecosystem Integration and Business Impact

Amplitude CDP integrates seamlessly with the broader Amplitude ecosystem, leveraging the company's analytics foundation to power advanced segmentation and personalization capabilities. The platform is designed to deliver measurable business outcomes, with documented conversion lift improvements of 15-30% through its personalization features.

The CDP serves as a bridge between data collection and activation, enabling organizations to move beyond basic analytics into actionable customer engagement. By combining behavioral analysis with predictive modeling, the platform supports both reactive segmentation based on past actions and proactive targeting based on predicted future behaviors.

The destination sync capabilities ensure that insights and segments generated within Amplitude can be operationalized across the entire marketing and customer experience technology stack, creating a unified approach to customer data activation.
