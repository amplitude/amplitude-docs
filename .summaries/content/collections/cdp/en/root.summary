## Amplitude CDP (Customer Data Platform)

Amplitude CDP is a comprehensive customer data platform that enables organizations to collect, process, and activate customer data across their entire ecosystem. The platform serves as a central hub for data ingestion, transformation, and distribution to power personalized customer experiences and data-driven decision making.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Amplitude CDP consists of three core components that work together to create a complete data activation pipeline:

**Sources** serve as the data ingestion layer, collecting customer behavioral data, events, and user properties from various touchpoints including web applications, mobile apps, server-side implementations, and third-party platforms.

**Audiences** represents the segmentation and personalization engine, leveraging Amplitude Activation's self-serve platform to transform raw data into actionable customer insights through behavioral cohorts, predictive cohorts, and computations. This component utilizes AutoML capabilities to generate predictions and recommendations that enable 1:1 personalization.

**Destinations** function as the data activation layer, enabling seamless export and synchronization of processed data and audience segments to third-party platforms and downstream systems for campaign execution and personalization delivery.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Behavioral Cohorts**: User segments created based on actual user actions and engagement patterns within the product or platform.

**Predictive Cohorts**: Forward-looking user segments generated using machine learning models to identify users likely to perform specific actions or exhibit certain behaviors.

**Computations**: Derived metrics and calculated values that transform raw event data into meaningful business insights and user attributes.

**Cohort Syncs**: The mechanism for delivering audience segments to external platforms, available in three modes:
- On-demand syncs for immediate data transfer
- Automated syncs for scheduled regular updates  
- Real-time syncs for instant data propagation

**Predictive Goals**: Machine learning targets that define the desired outcomes for predictive modeling, enabling the AutoML system to optimize for specific business objectives.

## API Endpoints and Integration Methods

The platform provides programmatic access through two primary APIs:

**Cohorts API**: Enables retrieval and management of audience segments, allowing external systems to programmatically access user cohorts for targeting and personalization.

**Profile API**: Provides access to individual user profiles and their associated properties, enabling real-time personalization and user-specific data retrieval.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude CDP operates as the central data orchestration layer within the broader Amplitude ecosystem, connecting analytics insights with activation capabilities. The platform bridges the gap between Amplitude's behavioral analytics and external marketing, personalization, and customer engagement tools.

The CDP enables organizations to operationalize their Amplitude analytics insights by automatically syncing high-value audience segments to advertising platforms, email marketing tools, personalization engines, and customer support systems. This creates a closed-loop system where analytical insights directly drive customer experience optimization.

The platform's AutoML-powered predictions and recommendations capabilities position it as an intelligent activation layer that not only moves data but enhances it with predictive intelligence, typically delivering 15-30% conversion lift through improved targeting and personalization accuracy.
