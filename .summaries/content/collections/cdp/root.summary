# Amplitude CDP Product Overview

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude CDP (Customer Data Platform) is a comprehensive data management and personalization solution that enables businesses to collect, analyze, and activate customer data across various platforms and channels. The platform focuses on delivering personalized customer experiences through data-driven insights and automated activation.

The CDP consists of two primary components:

1. **Amplitude Activation** - A self-serve personalization platform that enables 1:1 personalization through segmentation, personalization, and delivery mechanisms
2. **Amplitude Data** - The foundation for data collection and distribution that handles importing from sources and exporting to destinations

The platform promises to drive 15-30% lift in conversions without requiring specialized data science or engineering resources, making advanced personalization accessible to marketing and product teams.

## Product Relationships and Features

The Amplitude CDP architecture consists of four interconnected components:

1. **Amplitude Sources** - Entry points for data collection that integrate with various external systems
2. **Amplitude Data** - Core data management layer that processes, stores, and prepares customer data
3. **Amplitude Activation** - Personalization engine that leverages collected data to create targeted experiences
4. **Destinations** - Output channels where activated data is sent for execution

The data flow follows a logical progression:
- Data enters through Sources
- Gets processed in Amplitude Data
- Is analyzed and segmented in Amplitude Activation
- Is delivered to Destinations for execution

Amplitude Activation enables three key capabilities:
- **Segmentation**: Creating behavioral and predictive cohorts
- **Personalization**: Deploying predictions and recommendations
- **Delivery**: Utilizing syncs and APIs to activate data across the tech stack

Amplitude Data facilitates:
- Data import from multiple sources
- Data export to third-party platforms
- Data sharing across tools and stakeholders
