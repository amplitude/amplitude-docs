Amplitude CDP is a comprehensive customer data platform designed to collect, process, and activate customer data for personalized experiences, delivering reported conversion lifts of 15-30% through 1:1 personalization capabilities.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The platform operates through three interconnected core components forming a unified data pipeline:

**Sources** function as the data ingestion layer, capturing customer behavioral data and channeling it into the platform for downstream processing and analysis.

**Audiences** serve as the segmentation and intelligence engine, powered by Amplitude Activation's self-serve personalization platform. This component transforms raw behavioral data into actionable customer segments through multiple mechanisms:
- Behavioral cohorts that group users based on historical actions and engagement patterns
- Predictive cohorts utilizing AutoML capabilities to forecast future user behaviors
- Computations enabling custom audience definitions and advanced metrics
- Predictions and recommendations engines delivering personalized content and experiences

**Destinations** operate as the activation layer, facilitating data export and synchronization with third-party platforms through the Connections section interface, enabling multi-channel customer engagement.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Cohorts**: User segments defined by shared behavioral characteristics or predicted attributes, categorized into:
- *Behavioral cohorts*: Groups based on historical user actions and engagement patterns
- *Predictive cohorts*: Machine learning-generated segments forecasting future behaviors

**Computations**: Custom calculations and metrics applied to user data for advanced segmentation and analysis

**Predictions**: AutoML-powered forecasting capabilities that anticipate user behavior patterns and preferences

**Recommendations**: Personalized content and product suggestions generated through machine learning algorithms

**Syncs**: Data synchronization mechanisms available in multiple operational modes:
- *On-demand syncs*: User-triggered manual data exports
- *Automated syncs*: Scheduled data transfers
- *Real-time syncs*: Continuous data streaming for immediate activation

**Predictive Goals**: Target outcomes defined for machine learning models to optimize toward specific business objectives

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude CDP integrates with the broader Amplitude ecosystem through Amplitude Data, which provides underlying data infrastructure and analytics capabilities. External system connectivity is achieved through:

- **Third-party destination syncs** connecting to marketing automation platforms, advertising networks, and customer engagement tools
- **API-based integrations** enabling programmatic access to customer data and audience segments
- **Real-time data streaming** supporting immediate personalization and activation across customer touchpoints

## API Endpoints and Technical Interfaces

The platform exposes two primary APIs for data access and activation:

**Cohorts API**: Provides programmatic access to audience segments and cohort definitions for external system integration

**Profile API**: Delivers individual customer profile data and attributes for real-time personalization implementations

Destination management occurs through the **Connections section** interface, where users access the **Destinations tab** and utilize **Add Destination** functionality. Configuration is handled through destination-specific modals for setting up data export parameters and sync schedules.
