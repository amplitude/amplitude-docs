Amplitude CDP is a comprehensive customer data platform that centralizes customer data collection, processing, and activation to enable personalized experiences and data-driven decision making across organizations. The platform transforms raw customer data into actionable insights and segments that can be distributed to external systems for campaign execution and real-time personalization.

## Core Architecture and Component Relationships

The platform operates through three interconnected layers that form a complete data activation pipeline:

**Sources** function as the data ingestion foundation, capturing customer interactions and behavioral data from multiple touchpoints and channels. This raw data feeds directly into the platform's processing engine where it becomes available for analysis and segmentation.

**Audiences** represents the intelligence layer powered by Amplitude Activation, transforming ingested data into strategic customer segments. This component creates both behavioral cohorts based on observed user actions and predictive cohorts using AutoML capabilities to forecast future customer behaviors. The audience engine also performs computations that derive meaningful metrics and attributes from raw data, enabling sophisticated 1:1 personalization strategies.

**Destinations** serve as the activation layer, synchronizing processed segments and customer data to third-party platforms and external systems. This ensures that insights generated within Amplitude CDP can be operationalized across the entire marketing and customer experience technology stack.

## Key Terminology and Concepts

**Behavioral Cohorts** are customer segments built from actual user engagement patterns and actions observed within the platform, providing reactive segmentation capabilities.

**Predictive Cohorts** leverage machine learning models to identify customers likely to perform specific future actions or exhibit particular behaviors, enabling proactive targeting strategies.

**Computations** are data transformation operations that convert raw customer data into derived metrics, calculated attributes, and meaningful business indicators.

**Predictions** are AutoML-generated behavioral forecasts that power personalization recommendations and targeting optimization.

**Cohort Syncs** represent the data delivery mechanism with three operational modes:
- On-demand syncs for immediate segment transfers
- Automated syncs for scheduled regular updates
- Real-time syncs for continuous data streaming

**Predictive Goals** define specific business outcomes or user behaviors that guide the platform's machine learning optimization for cohort generation and personalization recommendations.

## API Integration Points

The platform exposes two primary programmatic interfaces:

**Cohorts API** enables external systems to retrieve audience segment definitions and membership data, supporting integration with marketing automation platforms and campaign management tools.

**Profile API** provides access to individual customer profiles and real-time attributes, facilitating personalization engines and customer service applications.

## Ecosystem Position and Business Impact

Amplitude CDP leverages the foundational analytics capabilities of the broader Amplitude ecosystem, extending beyond basic data analysis into actionable customer engagement. The platform bridges the gap between data collection and activation by combining behavioral analysis with predictive modeling capabilities.

The system delivers documented conversion lift improvements of 15-30% through its personalization features, demonstrating measurable business impact. By integrating seamlessly with existing marketing technology stacks through its destination sync capabilities, the platform enables unified customer data activation strategies that span multiple channels and touchpoints.

The CDP's position within the Amplitude ecosystem allows organizations to progress from descriptive analytics to predictive customer engagement, supporting both historical behavior-based segmentation and forward-looking predictive targeting within a single integrated platform.
