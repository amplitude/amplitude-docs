Amplitude CDP (Customer Data Platform) is a comprehensive customer data orchestration platform that enables organizations to collect, process, and activate customer data across their entire technology ecosystem. The platform functions as a central hub for data ingestion, transformation, and intelligent distribution, powering personalized customer experiences and data-driven decision making through advanced segmentation and machine learning capabilities.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Amplitude CDP architecture consists of three interconnected core components that form a complete data activation pipeline:

**Sources** constitute the data ingestion foundation, systematically collecting customer behavioral data, events, and user properties from diverse touchpoints including web applications, mobile applications, server-side implementations, and third-party platforms. This layer ensures comprehensive data capture across all customer interaction points.

**Audiences** represents the intelligent segmentation and personalization engine, leveraging Amplitude Activation's self-serve platform to transform raw behavioral data into actionable customer insights. This component creates behavioral cohorts based on actual user actions, generates predictive cohorts using AutoML capabilities, and produces computations that derive meaningful business metrics from raw event data. The audience engine enables sophisticated 1:1 personalization through machine learning-powered predictions and recommendations.

**Destinations** function as the data activation and distribution layer, facilitating seamless export and synchronization of processed data and refined audience segments to third-party platforms and downstream systems. This component enables campaign execution, personalization delivery, and real-time customer engagement across multiple channels.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Behavioral Cohorts**: User segments constructed from actual user actions and engagement patterns within products or platforms, providing historical behavior-based targeting capabilities.

**Predictive Cohorts**: Forward-looking user segments generated through machine learning models that identify users with high propensity to perform specific actions or exhibit particular behaviors, enabling proactive customer engagement.

**Computations**: Derived metrics and calculated values that transform raw event data into meaningful business insights, user attributes, and actionable intelligence for decision-making.

**Cohort Syncs**: The data delivery mechanism for distributing audience segments to external platforms, operating in three distinct modes:
- On-demand syncs for immediate, manual data transfer
- Automated syncs for scheduled, regular updates based on predefined intervals
- Real-time syncs for instantaneous data propagation and immediate activation

**Predictive Goals**: Machine learning optimization targets that define desired business outcomes for predictive modeling, enabling the AutoML system to optimize algorithms for specific conversion objectives and business metrics.

**AutoML**: Automated machine learning capabilities that generate predictions and recommendations without requiring manual model development, democratizing advanced analytics across organizations.

## API Endpoints and Integration Methods

The platform provides comprehensive programmatic access through two primary API interfaces:

**Cohorts API**: Enables programmatic retrieval and management of audience segments, allowing external systems to access user cohorts for targeting, personalization, and campaign activation. This API supports both bulk segment exports and individual cohort queries.

**Profile API**: Provides granular access to individual user profiles and their associated properties, enabling real-time personalization engines and user-specific data retrieval for dynamic content delivery and customer experience optimization.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude CDP operates as the central data orchestration and activation layer within the comprehensive Amplitude analytics ecosystem, serving as the critical bridge between behavioral analytics insights and practical customer engagement execution. The platform transforms analytical discoveries into operational customer experiences by connecting Amplitude's deep behavioral analytics with external marketing automation, personalization engines, advertising platforms, and customer engagement tools.

The CDP enables organizations to operationalize Amplitude analytics insights through automated synchronization of high-value audience segments to advertising platforms, email marketing systems, personalization engines, customer support platforms, and CRM systems. This creates a closed-loop data ecosystem where analytical insights directly drive customer experience optimization and business outcomes.

The platform's AutoML-powered predictions and recommendations capabilities position it as an intelligent activation layer that enhances data with predictive intelligence rather than simply moving static information. This intelligent approach typically delivers 15-30% conversion lift improvements through enhanced targeting precision and personalization accuracy, demonstrating measurable business impact from data activation initiatives.

The CDP integrates seamlessly with the broader Amplitude product suite, leveraging existing user behavioral data, event tracking, and analytics infrastructure while extending capabilities into predictive modeling and multi-channel activation, creating a unified customer data and activation platform.
