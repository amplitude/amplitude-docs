## Amplitude Android SDK Product Suite

The Amplitude Android SDK ecosystem is a comprehensive analytics tracking solution for Android applications, consisting of multiple SDKs and tools designed to capture, process, and transmit user behavior data. The product suite includes both legacy and modern implementations with a clear migration path from maintenance-mode SDKs to actively developed solutions.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

### Core SDK Architecture
The ecosystem centers around two primary Android SDKs with distinct architectural approaches:

**Legacy Android SDK** (`com.amplitude:android-sdk`) operates in maintenance mode, supporting Java and Kotlin with traditional event logging patterns. It uses `logEvent()` methods with JSONObject-based event properties and follows conventional Android SDK patterns.

**Modern Android-Kotlin SDK** (`com.amplitude:analytics-android`) serves as the actively developed successor, featuring modern Kotlin architecture with plugin-based extensibility. This SDK provides enhanced autocapture capabilities and uses `track()` and `identify()` methods for event handling.

### Code Generation Layer
**Ampli Wrapper** functions as a code generation tool that creates strongly typed APIs on top of the base SDKs. It generates type-safe event tracking methods based on Amplitude Data tracking plans, supporting both SDK variants while providing schema enforcement with IDE autocompletion capabilities.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Event Tracking Methods
- **track()** - Primary method for logging events in the modern SDK
- **identify()** - Method for setting user properties and establishing user identity
- **groupIdentify()** - Method for setting properties at the group level
- **setGroup()** - Method for associating users with specific groups
- **logEvent()** - Legacy event logging method used in the maintenance SDK

### Configuration Parameters
- **flushIntervalMillis** - Time interval configuration for batching events before transmission
- **flushQueueSize** - Threshold number of events to accumulate before automatic flush
- **minTimeBetweenSessionsMillis** - Session timeout duration configuration
- **migrateLegacyData** - Boolean setting to enable data transfer from legacy SDK implementations

### Autocapture Capabilities
- **AutocaptureOption** - Configuration object for automatic event collection settings
- **Sessions tracking** - Automatic session lifecycle management and duration tracking
- **App lifecycle events** - Automatic capture of foreground/background state transitions
- **Screen view tracking** - Automatic page and screen navigation event capture
- **Deep link tracking** - URL scheme and Android intent-based navigation tracking
- **Element interactions** - UI component interaction and user engagement capture

### Identity Management
- **deviceId** - Unique device identifier (ADID, App Set ID, or SDK-generated)
- **userId** - Application-specific user identifier for cross-session tracking
- **sessionId** - Session-specific identifier for event grouping
- **groupType/groupName** - Group classification system and identification

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

### Data Platform Integration
The SDKs integrate with Amplitude's data infrastructure through multiple touchpoints:

**Amplitude Data** provides schema management and tracking plan enforcement via the Ampli code generation system, ensuring data consistency across implementations.

**HTTP v2 API** serves as the modern event ingestion endpoint, handling real-time data transmission with improved performance and reliability.

**EU Data Residency** support through ServerZone configuration enables GDPR compliance and regional data governance requirements.

### Development Workflow Integration
The development process incorporates several tools and workflows:

**ampli CLI** provides command-line functionality for code generation and validation, with key commands including `ampli pull` for generating tracking code and `ampli status` for implementation verification.

**Tracking Plans** serve as schema definitions within the Amplitude Data platform, defining event structures and validation rules.

**Plugin Architecture** enables extensible event processing pipelines with enrichment and destination plugins for customized data handling.

### Privacy and Compliance Framework
- **COPPA Control** - Children's Online Privacy Protection Act compliance features
- **TrackingOptions** - Granular control mechanisms over data collection scope
- **Location Tracking** - Configurable geographic data collection with privacy controls
- **Advertising ID Management** - Privacy-conscious device identification strategies

## API Endpoints and Integration Points

### SDK Installation Dependencies
```
implementation 'com.amplitude:analytics-android:1.x.x'  // Modern SDK
implementation 'com.amplitude:android-sdk:2.x.x'        // Legacy SDK
```

### Core API Surface
**Configuration Classes**: `LoadOptions`, `LoadClientOptions`, `EventOptions` provide comprehensive SDK configuration capabilities.

**Event Tracking Methods**: Primary tracking functionality through `track()`, `identify()`, `groupIdentify()`, and `flush()` methods.

**Revenue Tracking**: Dedicated `Revenue` class with Google Play Store purchase verification integration.

**Plugin System**: Extensible architecture including `DestinationPlugin`, `NetworkTrackingPlugin`, and `AndroidNetworkConnectivityCheckerPlugin` for enhanced functionality.

### Command Line Interface
- `ampli pull` - Generates strongly typed tracking code from Amplitude Data tracking plans
- `ampli status` - Validates current implementation against defined tracking plan schemas

The Android SDK suite provides a comprehensive analytics solution with clear upgrade paths, extensive customization options, and deep integration with Amplitude's broader data platform ecosystem, enabling developers to implement robust analytics tracking with minimal configuration overhead.
