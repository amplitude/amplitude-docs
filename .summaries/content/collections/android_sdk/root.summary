# Amplitude Android SDK Product Suite

The Amplitude Android SDK ecosystem is a comprehensive analytics platform designed for Android application tracking and user behavior analysis. The product suite encompasses multiple SDK implementations, migration tools, and integration capabilities, structured around a transition from legacy Java-based architecture to modern Kotlin-based implementations with enhanced plugin systems and autocapture functionality.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Android SDK ecosystem operates through three interconnected tiers:

**Primary SDK Layer:**
- **Android-Kotlin SDK** (`com.amplitude:analytics-android`) - Current flagship implementation featuring modern architecture, plugin extensibility, and comprehensive autocapture capabilities
- **Android SDK** (`com.amplitude:android-sdk`) - Legacy implementation in maintenance mode, providing backward compatibility for existing integrations
- **Ampli Wrapper** - Code generation framework that creates strongly-typed tracking interfaces layered above core SDKs

**Integration and Migration Layer:**
The ecosystem implements a structured upgrade pathway with dedicated migration utilities, data transfer mechanisms, and compatibility bridges between legacy and modern implementations. The migration system preserves user data, session continuity, and configuration settings during SDK transitions.

**Plugin and Extension Layer:**
The modern SDK architecture supports modular functionality through enrichment plugins, destination plugins, and third-party integrations, enabling customizable data processing pipelines and external service connectivity.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Tracking Interface:**
- `track()` - Primary event recording method in modern SDK architecture
- `logEvent()` - Legacy event recording method for maintenance SDK
- `identify()` - User property assignment and identification management
- `groupIdentify()` - Group-level property management and association
- `setGroup()` - User-to-group relationship establishment
- `flush()` - Immediate event transmission trigger

**Configuration Parameters:**
- **flushIntervalMillis** - Automatic event batching time interval
- **flushQueueSize** - Event batch size threshold for transmission
- **sessionTimeoutMillis** - Session expiration duration
- **minTimeBetweenSessionsMillis** - Minimum session separation interval
- **migrateLegacyData** - Legacy data preservation during SDK upgrade
- **serverZone** - Regional data residency configuration

**Autocapture System:**
- **AutocaptureOption** - Automated event collection configuration
- **Session tracking** - Automatic session lifecycle management
- **App lifecycle events** - Application state change monitoring
- **Screen views** - Navigation and view tracking
- **Deep links** - URL-based navigation capture
- **Element interactions** - UI component interaction tracking

**Advanced Configuration:**
- **TrackingOptions** - Granular data collection control
- **COPPA control** - Children's privacy compliance features
- **ADID (Advertising ID)** - Device identification via Google Play Services
- **App Set ID** - Application-scoped device identification
- **NetworkTrackingPlugin** - HTTP request monitoring and analysis

## Product Ecosystem Integration

**Amplitude Data Platform Integration:**
The Ampli system creates a bidirectional integration with Amplitude Data's tracking plan infrastructure:
1. Tracking schemas defined in Amplitude Data platform
2. `ampli pull` generates locally-typed tracking code
3. `ampli status` validates implementation schema compliance
4. Runtime enforcement of event structure and property types

**Plugin Architecture Framework:**
The modern SDK implements extensible plugin system supporting:
- **Enrichment plugins** - Pre-transmission data enhancement and transformation
- **Destination plugins** - Custom routing, processing, and external service integration
- **NetworkTrackingPlugin** - HTTP request interception and analytics
- **AndroidNetworkConnectivityCheckerPlugin** - Offline mode detection and queue management

**Third-party Service Integration:**
- **Google Play Services** - Advertising ID and App Set ID acquisition
- **OkHttp** - HTTP client dependency for network operations
- **Jetpack Compose** - Modern UI framework element tracking support
- **ProGuard/R8** - Code obfuscation compatibility and configuration

**Data Residency and Compliance:**
- EU data residency through `serverZone` configuration
- COPPA compliance controls for applications serving minors
- Granular tracking options for privacy-sensitive implementations

## API Endpoints and CLI Commands

**Ampli CLI Interface:**
- `ampli pull` - Downloads tracking plan and generates strongly-typed code from Amplitude Data
- `ampli status` - Validates current implementation against defined tracking schema

**Core SDK Methods:**
- `Amplitude.getInstance().track(eventType, eventProperties)` - Modern event tracking
- `Amplitude.getInstance().identify(identifyObject)` - User identification and property setting
- `Amplitude.getInstance().setUserId(userId)` - User ID assignment
- `Amplitude.getInstance().setDeviceId(deviceId)` - Device identification override
- `Amplitude.getInstance().logRevenueV2(revenue)` - Revenue tracking (legacy SDK)
- `Amplitude.getInstance().setGroup(groupType, groupName)` - Group association

**Configuration Classes and Interfaces:**
- `LoadOptions` and `LoadClientOptions` - Ampli initialization and client configuration
- `EventOptions` - Per-event configuration and metadata
- `BaseEvent` - Event structure interface for modern SDK
- `MiddlewarePayload` - Legacy SDK middleware processing system
- `TrackingOptions` - Privacy and data collection controls

**Dependency Management:**
- Maven Central distribution with `com.amplitude` group identifier
- Gradle and Maven build system support
- Specific package variants for different SDK implementations
- ProGuard configuration rules for release builds
- Android manifest permission declarations for device ID and network access

The ecosystem supports comprehensive offline functionality, automatic retry mechanisms, and configurable data transmission policies, enabling robust analytics implementation across diverse Android application architectures and deployment scenarios.
