# Amplitude Android SDK Product Suite

The Amplitude Android SDK ecosystem is a comprehensive analytics platform designed for Android applications, offering multiple SDK options and tools for event tracking, user analytics, and data management. The suite provides both modern Kotlin-based implementations and legacy support, with extensive customization capabilities through plugins and middleware.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The ecosystem is structured around three primary components that work together to provide flexible analytics implementation options:

**Android-Kotlin SDK** (`com.amplitude:analytics-android`) serves as the flagship modern implementation, built with Kotlin and supporting both Java and Kotlin applications. This SDK features a plugin-based architecture, enhanced privacy controls, and performance optimizations.

**Legacy Android SDK** (`com.amplitude:android-sdk`) remains in maintenance mode for existing implementations, receiving critical updates while new feature development focuses on the Kotlin SDK. A comprehensive migration path exists between these SDKs, including automatic data migration through the `migrateLegacyData` configuration.

**Ampli Wrapper** provides a code generation layer that sits atop either core SDK, creating strongly typed APIs generated from Amplitude Data tracking plans. This wrapper enables schema-driven development with compile-time validation and type safety.

The architecture supports extensibility through plugins (Kotlin SDK) and middleware (Legacy SDK), allowing custom enrichment, validation, and routing of analytics data to multiple destinations.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Event Tracking Terminology:**
- `track()` - Primary event logging method in Kotlin SDK (replaces legacy `logEvent()`)
- `BaseEvent` - Core event structure containing properties and metadata
- `EventOptions` - Per-event configuration object
- `EventCallback` - Handler for event processing completion
- `Revenue` - Specialized event type for purchase tracking with Play Store verification

**User and Session Management:**
- `identify()` - Sets user properties and characteristics
- `groupIdentify()` - Manages properties for user groups
- `setGroup()` - Associates users with organizational groups
- `Device ID` - Unique device identifier with multiple generation strategies (ADID, App Set ID)
- `User ID` - Application-defined user identifier
- `sessionId` - Unique session identifier with configurable timeout behavior
- `minTimeBetweenSessionsMillis` - Session timeout configuration

**Privacy and Configuration:**
- `TrackingOptions` - Granular privacy controls for disabling specific data collection
- `COPPA` - Children's Online Privacy Protection Act compliance controls
- `ServerZone.EU` - European data residency configuration
- `optOut` - Global tracking disable control
- `Autocapture` - Automatic tracking of predefined events (sessions, screen views, app lifecycle, deep links, element interactions)

**Architecture Components:**
- `Plugins` - Extensible architecture for data enrichment and routing
- `DestinationPlugin` - Plugin type for routing events to external systems
- `NetworkTrackingPlugin` - Network request monitoring capability
- `Middleware` - Legacy SDK extensibility mechanism using `MiddlewarePayload`

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The Android SDK integrates deeply with Amplitude's broader analytics platform and external systems:

**Amplitude Data Integration** enables schema-driven development through the Ampli wrapper, which connects to centrally managed tracking plans. The `ampli CLI` tool facilitates code generation and schema management with commands like `ampli pull` for downloading schemas and `ampli status` for implementation validation.

**Platform Integration** leverages Android-specific features including Google Play Store revenue verification, Advertising ID (ADID) for attribution tracking, App Set ID for privacy-compliant device identification, foreground tracking for session accuracy, and network state monitoring for offline support.

**Development Workflow Support** accommodates multiple approaches: direct SDK integration for flexible implementations, Ampli wrapper for schema-driven type safety, and hybrid combinations of both methodologies.

## API Endpoints and Configuration

**Core Tracking Methods:**
```kotlin
amplitude.track("Event Name", eventProperties)
amplitude.identify(Identify().set("property", "value"))
amplitude.revenue(Revenue().setProductId("product").setPrice(9.99))
amplitude.setGroup("groupType", "groupName")
amplitude.groupIdentify("groupType", "groupName", groupProperties)
```

**Configuration Parameters:**
- `flushQueueSize` and `flushIntervalMillis` for batch processing
- `optOut` and `enableCoppaControl()` for privacy compliance
- `trackingOptions` for granular data collection control
- `serverZone: ServerZone.EU` for data residency
- `minTimeBetweenSessionsMillis` for session management

**Ampli Integration:**
```kotlin
ampli.load(LoadOptions(client = LoadClientOptions()))
ampli.eventName(EventNameProperties(property = "value"))
ampli.flush()
ampli.identify(userId, identifyProperties)
```

**Plugin System:**
The Kotlin SDK supports custom plugins implementing `Plugin` interface with methods like `setup()`, `execute()`, and `teardown()` for extending functionality.

The ecosystem provides comprehensive analytics capabilities while maintaining implementation flexibility, supporting everything from simple event tracking to complex, schema-driven analytics architectures with full type safety and validation.
