## Amplitude Android SDK Collection

The Amplitude Android SDK collection provides comprehensive analytics tracking solutions for Android applications through three interconnected components: a legacy maintenance-mode Android SDK, a modern Android-Kotlin SDK with plugin architecture, and the Ampli Wrapper for type-safe event tracking. This ecosystem enables developers to implement robust analytics including event tracking, user identification, revenue measurement, session management, and automated behavior capture.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The collection follows an evolutionary architecture where the legacy Android SDK (`com.amplitude:android-sdk`) serves as the foundation while being gradually superseded by the Android-Kotlin SDK (`com.amplitude:analytics-android`). The migration path flows from the maintenance SDK to the modern implementation, with both supporting core analytics functionality but differing in architectural approaches - the legacy SDK uses middleware patterns while the modern SDK implements a plugin-based architecture.

The Ampli Wrapper operates as a code generation layer that works with either SDK implementation, providing compile-time type safety and schema enforcement based on centralized tracking plans managed through Amplitude Data. This creates a three-tier architecture: the underlying SDK for core functionality, the optional Ampli layer for type safety, and the Amplitude Data platform for schema governance.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**SDK Components:**
- **Android SDK**: Legacy maintenance-mode implementation using `com.amplitude:android-sdk`
- **Android-Kotlin SDK**: Modern implementation using `com.amplitude:analytics-android` with plugin architecture
- **Ampli Wrapper**: Code generation tool creating strongly-typed APIs from tracking plans

**Core Tracking Methods:**
- **track()**: Primary event logging method (supersedes legacy `logEvent()`)
- **identify()**: User property management and identification
- **groupIdentify()**: Group-level property assignment
- **revenue()**: Revenue event tracking with Google Play Store verification support
- **flush()**: Force immediate event transmission (replaces legacy `uploadEvents()`)

**Configuration Parameters:**
- **flushIntervalMillis**: Automatic event transmission timing
- **flushQueueSize**: Event batching threshold
- **serverZone**: Data residency control (EU/US regions)
- **deviceId/userId**: User identification management
- **sessionTimeoutMillis**: Session boundary definition
- **migrateLegacyData**: Legacy SDK data transition configuration

**Advanced Capabilities:**
- **Autocapture**: Automated tracking of sessions, app lifecycles, screen views, deep links, and UI interactions
- **TrackingOptions**: Granular data collection controls for COPPA compliance
- **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture supporting enrichment and destination plugins

## Ecosystem Integration

The Android SDK collection integrates deeply with Amplitude's broader analytics platform through multiple connection points. Event data flows to Amplitude's HTTP V2 API endpoints with automatic batching, retry logic, and offline queuing. The Ampli Wrapper connects to Amplitude Data for centralized tracking plan management, utilizing the `ampli CLI` for code generation workflows.

Revenue tracking integrates with Google Play Store receipt verification systems, while user identification connects with Android advertising ID (ADID) and App Set ID frameworks. The plugin architecture enables third-party integrations through custom destination plugins and enrichment middleware, allowing data to flow to additional analytics platforms or internal systems.

## API Endpoints and CLI Commands

**Ampli CLI Operations:**
- `ampli pull`: Downloads latest tracking plan schema and generates typed API code
- `ampli status`: Validates local implementation against tracking plan requirements

**Primary SDK Methods:**
- `Amplitude.getInstance().track(eventType, eventProperties)`: Event logging
- `Amplitude.getInstance().identify(identifyObject)`: User property management
- `Amplitude.getInstance().setGroup(groupType, groupValue)`: Group assignment
- `Amplitude.getInstance().revenue().track(revenueEvent)`: Revenue tracking
- `Amplitude.getInstance().flush()`: Force event transmission

**Configuration APIs:**
- `LoadOptions` and `LoadClientOptions`: Ampli initialization configuration
- `EventOptions`: Per-event configuration parameters
- `AutocaptureOption`: Enumeration for automated tracking features
- `TrackingOptions`: Privacy and compliance control settings

The collection supports both Gradle and Maven dependency management systems, requires specific ProGuard configuration for code obfuscation compatibility, and needs Android manifest permissions for network access and optional location tracking capabilities. Integration involves adding dependencies, configuring API keys, and implementing tracking calls throughout the application lifecycle.
