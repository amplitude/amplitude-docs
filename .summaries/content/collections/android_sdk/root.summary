# Amplitude Android SDK Product Suite

The Amplitude Android SDK ecosystem is a comprehensive analytics platform designed for tracking user behavior and events in Android applications. The product suite encompasses multiple SDKs, tools, and integrations that provide both legacy support and modern implementation approaches, with a strategic focus on migrating users to a contemporary Kotlin-based architecture.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Android SDK ecosystem is built around three interconnected components that work together to provide a complete analytics solution:

**Primary SDK Components:**
- **Android-Kotlin SDK** (`com.amplitude:analytics-android`) - The flagship, actively maintained SDK featuring modern architecture, plugin system, and enhanced performance
- **Android SDK** (`com.amplitude:android-sdk`) - Legacy SDK currently in maintenance mode, providing continued support for existing implementations while encouraging migration
- **Ampli Wrapper** - A sophisticated code generation tool that creates strongly-typed, validated APIs on top of the core SDKs

**Architectural Evolution:**
The product suite follows a deliberate evolution strategy from the legacy Android SDK to the modern Kotlin implementation. This transition is supported by comprehensive migration tooling, data transfer utilities, and parallel documentation that ensures seamless upgrades without data loss or functionality gaps.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Event Tracking Methods:**
- `track()` - Primary event tracking method in the modern Kotlin SDK for logging user actions and behaviors
- `logEvent()` - Legacy event tracking method used in the maintenance SDK for backward compatibility
- `identify()` - User property management for associating attributes with specific users
- `groupIdentify()` - Group-level property management for organizational or cohort-based analytics
- `setGroup()` - Establishes user-to-group associations for segmentation and analysis
- `logRevenueV2()` - Specialized revenue event tracking with built-in verification capabilities

**Configuration Parameters:**
- `flushIntervalMillis` - Controls the batching interval for event transmission to optimize network usage
- `flushQueueSize` - Defines the event queue size threshold that triggers automatic flush operations
- `sessionTimeoutMillis` - Sets the duration after which user sessions are considered expired
- `minTimeBetweenSessionsMillis` - Establishes minimum time requirements between distinct session boundaries
- `instanceName` - Unique identifier enabling multiple SDK instances within a single application

**Device and User Identification:**
- **ADID** (Advertising ID) - Google's advertising identifier accessible via `useAdvertisingIdForDeviceId` configuration
- **App Set ID** - Privacy-focused device identifier implemented through `useAppSetIdForDeviceId` for enhanced user privacy
- `setUserId()` - Custom user identification method for linking analytics data to business user IDs
- `setDeviceId()` - Custom device identification for specific device tracking requirements

**Data Management and Privacy:**
- `migrateLegacyData` - Configuration option enabling seamless data transition from legacy SDK implementations
- `TrackingOptions` - Comprehensive privacy controls and data collection preference management
- `COPPA` compliance - Children's Online Privacy Protection Act compliance controls for applications serving minors

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

**Amplitude Data Platform Integration:**
The Ampli Wrapper serves as a critical bridge to Amplitude Data's centralized tracking plan system. It generates strongly-typed code from centralized schema definitions, ensuring cross-platform consistency and providing compile-time validation that prevents tracking errors before deployment.

**Plugin Architecture System:**
The Kotlin SDK implements a sophisticated plugin architecture supporting multiple extension types:
- **Enrichment Plugins** - Enhance event data with additional context before transmission
- **Destination Plugins** - Enable custom data routing, processing, and third-party integrations
- **NetworkTrackingPlugin** - Monitors network state changes for connectivity-aware analytics
- **AndroidNetworkConnectivityCheckerPlugin** - Manages offline mode operations and data queuing

**Global Data Residency Compliance:**
Both SDKs support EU data residency requirements through `serverZone` configuration, enabling organizations to comply with GDPR, CCPA, and other regional data protection regulations by controlling where analytics data is processed and stored.

## API Endpoints and Command Line Tools

**Ampli CLI Operations:**
- `ampli pull` - Downloads the latest tracking plan from Amplitude Data and generates corresponding typed code
- `ampli status` - Validates local implementation against the centralized tracking plan to identify discrepancies

**Backend API Integration:**
- **Amplitude HTTP v2 API** - Primary backend service endpoint for event ingestion and processing
- **Google Play Store API Integration** - Enables revenue verification for in-app purchase tracking and fraud prevention

**Configuration Implementation:**
```kotlin
// Modern Kotlin SDK Configuration
Configuration(
    flushIntervalMillis = 30000,
    flushQueueSize = 30,
    minTimeBetweenSessionsMillis = 300000,
    serverZone = ServerZone.EU
)

// Autocapture Configuration Options
AutocaptureOption.SESSIONS           // Automatic session tracking
AutocaptureOption.APP_LIFECYCLES     // Application state changes
AutocaptureOption.SCREEN_VIEWS       // Screen navigation tracking
AutocaptureOption.DEEP_LINKS         // Deep link interaction capture
AutocaptureOption.ELEMENT_INTERACTIONS // UI element interaction tracking
```

**Advanced Integration Features:**
- **Location Tracking** - GPS-based event enrichment through `locationListening` for geospatial analytics
- **SSL Pinning** - Enhanced security implementation via `PinnedAmplitudeClient` for secure data transmission
- **Middleware Support** - Custom event processing pipeline for data transformation and filtering
- **Jetpack Compose Integration** - Native support for modern Android UI framework with `testTag` compatibility
- **ProGuard Compatibility** - Code obfuscation support with proper configuration rules for production builds
- **Multi-Instance Support** - Capability to run multiple SDK instances for complex application architectures or A/B testing scenarios

The ecosystem delivers enterprise-grade analytics capabilities while maintaining comprehensive backward compatibility and providing clear, well-documented migration paths that minimize disruption for existing implementations. The architecture supports both simple integration scenarios and complex enterprise deployments with advanced customization requirements.
