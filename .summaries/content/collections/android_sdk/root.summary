# Amplitude Android SDK Product Suite

The Amplitude Android SDK ecosystem is a comprehensive analytics platform designed for Android applications, featuring multiple SDKs and tools that enable detailed user behavior tracking, event analytics, and data collection. The suite encompasses both legacy Java-based implementations and modern Kotlin-based solutions, with a clear migration path and extensive autocapture capabilities.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Android SDK ecosystem is structured around three interconnected components:

**Core SDKs:**
- **Android-Kotlin SDK** (`com.amplitude:analytics-android`) - The flagship, actively developed SDK representing the modern analytics solution with enhanced performance and developer experience
- **Android SDK** (`com.amplitude:android-sdk`) - The legacy Java-based SDK currently in maintenance mode, providing backward compatibility
- **Ampli Wrapper** - A sophisticated code generation layer that creates strongly typed, schema-validated APIs on top of the core SDKs

**Migration Architecture:**
The ecosystem implements a structured upgrade path from legacy to modern implementations, featuring built-in migration utilities (`migrateLegacyData` configuration), compatibility layers, and data preservation mechanisms to ensure seamless transitions without analytics data loss.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Primary Tracking Methods:**
- `track()` - Core event tracking method in the modern SDK (supersedes legacy `logEvent()`)
- `identify()` - User property management and user identification
- `groupIdentify()` - Group-level property management for organizational analytics
- `setGroup()` - Establishes user-to-group associations for cohort analysis
- `logRevenueV2()` - Revenue tracking with integrated Google Play Store receipt verification

**Configuration Parameters:**
- `flushIntervalMillis` - Time-based batching interval for event transmission optimization
- `flushQueueSize` - Event count threshold for automatic batch transmission
- `sessionTimeoutMillis` - Session expiration duration for user engagement tracking
- `minTimeBetweenSessionsMillis` - Minimum interval required between distinct sessions
- `migrateLegacyData` - Boolean flag enabling data migration from legacy SDK implementations

**Autocapture Capabilities:**
- `AutocaptureOption.SESSIONS` - Automated session lifecycle tracking
- `AutocaptureOption.APP_LIFECYCLES` - Application state transition monitoring
- `AutocaptureOption.SCREEN_VIEWS` - Screen navigation and view tracking
- `AutocaptureOption.DEEP_LINKS` - Deep link interaction and attribution tracking
- `AutocaptureOption.ELEMENT_INTERACTIONS` - UI element interaction capture

**Identity Management System:**
- `deviceId` - Persistent device-specific identifier
- `userId` - Application-defined user identifier
- `ADID` - Google Advertising ID for attribution and marketing analytics
- `App Set ID` - Google Play Services-provided identifier for privacy-compliant tracking

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The Android SDK suite integrates extensively with Amplitude's broader analytics and data platform:

**Amplitude Data Platform Integration:**
- **Tracking Plans** - Schema definition, validation, and enforcement through Ampli code generation
- **Data Validation** - Real-time schema compliance checking and type safety enforcement
- **Code Generation** - Automated SDK wrapper creation via `ampli CLI` toolchain

**Infrastructure and Compliance:**
- **EU Data Residency** - `setServerZone` configuration for GDPR compliance and data localization
- **Batch API** - HTTP v2 API integration for efficient, high-volume data transmission
- **Plugin Architecture** - Extensible plugin system supporting enrichment, transformation, and destination plugins

**Development Toolchain:**
- **Ampli CLI Commands:**
  - `ampli pull` - Downloads latest tracking plan schema and generates type-safe code
  - `ampli status` - Validates current implementation against defined tracking plan
- **Network Tracking Plugin** - OkHttp interceptor for comprehensive network request monitoring
- **ProGuard/R8 Support** - Code obfuscation and minification compatibility

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Package Dependencies:**
- Modern SDK: `com.amplitude:analytics-android` (available via Gradle/Maven)
- Legacy SDK: `com.amplitude:android-sdk` (Maven Central distribution)
- OkHTTP dependency required for network operations and HTTP client functionality

**Configuration Classes:**
- `LoadOptions` / `LoadClientOptions` - Ampli initialization and client configuration
- `EventOptions` - Per-event metadata, configuration, and context management
- `TrackingOptions` - Privacy controls and compliance-focused tracking restrictions
- `DestinationPlugin` - Custom data routing and destination configuration

**Privacy and Compliance Framework:**
- `enableCoppaControl()` - COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) compliance enforcement
- `TrackingOptions` - Granular control system for disabling specific tracking capabilities
- Location tracking via `enableLocationListening()` with privacy controls
- SSL certificate pinning through `PinnedAmplitudeClient` for enhanced security

**Advanced Feature Set:**
- **Offline Mode** - `setOffline()` enables network-disconnected operation with local event queuing
- **Middleware Support** - `MiddlewarePayload` system for custom data transformation and enrichment
- **Dynamic Configuration** - `setUseDynamicConfig()` enables remote configuration management
- **Jetpack Compose Integration** - Native support for modern Android UI framework with declarative tracking
- **Revenue Verification** - Integrated Google Play Store receipt validation for transaction authenticity

The ecosystem prioritizes type safety, developer experience, and comprehensive analytics coverage while maintaining flexibility for custom implementations, compliance requirements, and enterprise-scale deployments.
