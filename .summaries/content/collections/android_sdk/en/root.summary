The Android SDK collection encompasses Amplitude's analytics tracking solutions for Android applications, featuring both legacy and modern SDK implementations along with code generation tools for type-safe event tracking.

## Product Overview

The Android SDK ecosystem consists of three primary components: the maintenance-mode Android SDK for Java/Kotlin applications, the modern Android-Kotlin SDK with enhanced features and plugin architecture, and the Ampli Wrapper that generates strongly-typed APIs from Amplitude Data tracking plans. These tools enable comprehensive analytics tracking including events, user properties, revenue, sessions, and automated behavior capture in Android applications.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Android SDK collection follows an evolutionary architecture where the legacy Android SDK (`com.amplitude:android-sdk`) is being superseded by the Android-Kotlin SDK (`com.amplitude:analytics-android`). The Ampli Wrapper operates as a code generation layer that works with either SDK to provide compile-time type safety and schema enforcement based on centralized tracking plans.

The migration path flows from the maintenance Android SDK to the Android-Kotlin SDK, with the Ampli Wrapper serving as an optional enhancement layer for teams requiring strict event schema governance. Both SDKs support core analytics functionality but differ in their architectural approaches - the legacy SDK uses middleware patterns while the modern SDK implements a plugin-based architecture.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core SDK Components:**
- **Android SDK**: Legacy maintenance-mode SDK using `com.amplitude:android-sdk` package
- **Android-Kotlin SDK**: Modern SDK using `com.amplitude:analytics-android` package with plugin architecture
- **Ampli Wrapper**: Code generation tool creating strongly-typed APIs from Amplitude Data tracking plans

**Tracking Methods:**
- **track()**: Modern method for event logging (replaces legacy `logEvent()`)
- **identify()**: User property management and identification
- **groupIdentify()**: Group-level property management
- **revenue()**: Revenue event tracking with optional Google Play Store verification
- **flush()**: Force immediate event transmission (replaces `uploadEvents()`)

**Configuration Concepts:**
- **flushIntervalMillis**: Automatic event transmission interval
- **flushQueueSize**: Event batch size threshold
- **serverZone**: Data residency control (EU/US)
- **deviceId/userId**: User identification management
- **sessionTimeoutMillis**: Session boundary definition

**Advanced Features:**
- **Autocapture**: Automated tracking of sessions, app lifecycles, screen views, deep links, and element interactions
- **TrackingOptions**: Granular control over data collection (COPPA compliance)
- **Plugin System**: Extensible architecture for enrichment and destination plugins
- **migrateLegacyData**: Configuration for transitioning from legacy SDK data

## Ecosystem Integration

The Android SDK collection integrates with the broader Amplitude ecosystem through multiple touchpoints. The SDKs connect to Amplitude's HTTP V2 API endpoints for event ingestion, with automatic batching and retry logic. The Ampli Wrapper integrates with Amplitude Data for centralized tracking plan management and uses the `ampli CLI` for code generation workflows.

Revenue tracking integrates with Google Play Store for receipt verification, while user identification connects with advertising ID (ADID) and App Set ID systems. The plugin architecture enables integration with third-party tools through custom destination plugins and enrichment middleware.

## API Endpoints and CLI Commands

**Ampli CLI Commands:**
- `ampli pull`: Downloads latest tracking plan and generates typed API
- `ampli status`: Validates local implementation against tracking plan schema

**Key SDK Methods:**
- `Amplitude.getInstance().track(eventType, eventProperties)`
- `Amplitude.getInstance().identify(identifyObject)`
- `Amplitude.getInstance().setGroup(groupType, groupValue)`
- `Amplitude.getInstance().revenue().track(revenueEvent)`
- `Amplitude.getInstance().flush()`

**Configuration APIs:**
- `LoadOptions` and `LoadClientOptions` for Ampli initialization
- `EventOptions` for per-event configuration
- `AutocaptureOption` enum for automated tracking features
- `TrackingOptions` for privacy and compliance controls

The SDK collection supports both Gradle and Maven dependency management, with specific ProGuard configuration requirements and Android manifest permissions for network access and location tracking capabilities.
