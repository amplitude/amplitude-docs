# Amplitude Android SDK Product Overview

## Product Overview

The Amplitude Android SDK is a suite of analytics tracking solutions for Android applications that enables developers to capture user behavior, track events, and analyze user interactions. The product consists of two main SDK versions:

1. **Android-Kotlin SDK** (`com.amplitude:analytics-android`) - The latest, actively maintained SDK written in Kotlin with modern architecture
2. **Legacy Android SDK** (`com.amplitude:android-sdk`) - The original Java-based SDK now in maintenance mode

Additionally, the ecosystem includes the **Ampli Wrapper**, a code-generated layer that provides type-safe event tracking based on a predefined tracking plan.

## Key Features and Capabilities

### Core Analytics Functionality
- **Event Tracking**: Capture user actions and behaviors with custom properties
- **User Identification**: Associate events with specific users through unique identifiers
- **User Properties**: Store and update attributes about users
- **Session Management**: Track user engagement sessions with configurable timeouts
- **Revenue Tracking**: Monitor in-app purchases and revenue-generating activities
- **Group Analytics**: Associate users with organizations or groups

### Advanced Capabilities
- **Autocapture**: Automatically track screen views, deep links, and element interactions
- **Offline Support**: Queue events when offline and send when connectivity is restored
- **Middleware**: Intercept and modify events before they're sent to Amplitude
- **Batching**: Optimize network usage by sending events in batches
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extend functionality through plugins (Android-Kotlin SDK)
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Adjust SDK behavior remotely

## Product Relationships and Architecture

### SDK Hierarchy
- **Android-Kotlin SDK**: The recommended modern implementation
  - Built with a plugin architecture for extensibility
  - Provides improved type safety and Kotlin-first development experience
  - Supports all modern Android development patterns
  
- **Legacy Android SDK**: The original implementation
  - Java-based implementation with more traditional architecture
  - In maintenance mode (bug fixes only)
  - Uses `AmplitudeClient` as the main interface

- **Ampli Wrapper**: A code-generated layer that sits on top of either SDK
  - Generated from a tracking plan defined in Amplitude Data
  - Provides type-safe event tracking with IDE autocompletion
  - Enforces event schemas to prevent instrumentation errors

### Integration Points
- Both SDKs send data to Amplitude's HTTP V2 API
- The Android-Kotlin SDK uses a plugin architecture where core functionality and extensions are implemented as plugins
- The Ampli Wrapper can be generated to work with either SDK as the underlying implementation

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: A discrete user action or occurrence that is tracked (e.g., button click, page view)
- **User Properties**: Attributes associated with a user (e.g., name, email, preferences)
- **Device ID**: A unique identifier for the device, used for tracking anonymous users
- **User ID**: A unique identifier for authenticated users, typically set after login
- **Session**: A period of continuous user engagement, defined by configurable timeout
- **Tracking Plan**: A schema that defines the expected structure of events and properties
- **Middleware**: Code that intercepts events before they're sent to Amplitude
- **Plugin**: Modular component that adds functionality to the Android-Kotlin SDK
- **Identify**: Operation to set or update user properties
- **Group**: Collection of users, such as an organization or account
- **Revenue**: Monetary value associated with user actions

## API and Implementation Details

### Android-Kotlin SDK Key Methods
- `Amplitude.getInstance().init(context, apiKey, configuration)` - Initialize the SDK
- `track(event, eventProperties)` - Log an event with properties
- `identify(identifyObj)` - Set or modify user properties
- `setUserId(userId)` - Identify a user with a unique ID
- `flush()` - Force send events to Amplitude servers
- `setGroup(groupType, groupName)` - Associate user with a group
- `groupIdentify(groupType, groupName, identifyObj)` - Set group properties

### Legacy Android SDK Key Methods
- `AmplitudeClient.getInstance().initialize(context, apiKey)` - Initialize the SDK
- `logEvent(eventType, eventProperties)` - Log an event with properties
- `identify(identifyObj)` - Set or modify user properties
- `setUserId(userId)` - Identify a user with a unique ID
- `uploadEvents()` - Force send events to Amplitude servers
- `setGroup(groupType, groupName)` - Associate user with a group
- `groupIdentify(groupType, groupName, identifyObj)` - Set group properties

### Ampli Wrapper Key Methods
- `ampli.load(LoadOptions)` - Initialize the Ampli wrapper
- `ampli.identify(userId, identifyObj)` - Identify a user
- `ampli.track(event)` - Track a strongly-typed event
- `ampli.flush()` - Force send events
- `ampli.setGroup(groupType, groupName)` - Associate user with a group
- `ampli.groupIdentify(groupType, groupName, identifyObj)` - Set group properties
- `ampli pull` - CLI command to pull tracking plan updates
- `ampli status` - CLI command to check tracking plan status

## Migration Path

The documentation provides a clear migration path from the legacy Android SDK to the Android-Kotlin SDK, including:

1. Updating dependencies from `com.amplitude:android-sdk` to `com.amplitude:analytics-android`
2. Changing initialization patterns to use the new Configuration object
3. Updating method calls (e.g., `logEvent()` to `track()`)
4. Adapting to the new plugin architecture
5. Handling storage provider customization

The migration preserves existing functionality while providing access to the newer, more maintainable codebase with additional features.
