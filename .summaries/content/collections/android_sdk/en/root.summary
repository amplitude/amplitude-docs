## Amplitude Android SDK Product Suite

The Amplitude Android SDK ecosystem consists of multiple SDKs and tools designed for comprehensive analytics tracking in Android applications. The product suite includes a legacy maintenance SDK, a modern Kotlin-based SDK, and code generation tools for type-safe event tracking.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

### Core SDKs
The ecosystem centers around two primary SDKs:

**Legacy Android SDK** (`com.amplitude:android-sdk`) - The original maintenance-mode SDK supporting Java and Kotlin applications with traditional event logging patterns using `logEvent()` methods and JSONObject-based event properties.

**Android-Kotlin SDK** (`com.amplitude:analytics-android`) - The modern, actively developed SDK built specifically for Kotlin with enhanced features including plugin architecture, autocapture capabilities, and improved API design using `track()` methods.

### Code Generation Layer
**Ampli Wrapper** - A code generation tool that creates strongly typed APIs on top of either SDK, generating client code from Amplitude Data tracking plans to provide compile-time schema enforcement and IDE autocompletion.

### Migration Path
The ecosystem includes comprehensive migration tooling to transition from the legacy SDK to the Kotlin SDK, including automatic data migration via `migrateLegacyData` configuration and API mapping documentation.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Event Tracking Concepts
- **track()** - Primary method for logging events in the Kotlin SDK
- **logEvent()** - Legacy method for event logging in the maintenance SDK
- **identify()** - Method for setting user properties and identification
- **groupIdentify()** - Method for setting group-level properties
- **revenue()** - Specialized tracking for revenue events with Google Play Store verification

### Configuration and Management
- **flushQueueSize/flushIntervalMillis** - Batch processing controls for event transmission
- **TrackingOptions** - Configuration object for disabling specific data collection
- **LoadOptions/LoadClientOptions** - Ampli-specific configuration for SDK initialization
- **EventOptions** - Per-event configuration including destination routing

### Architecture Components
- **Plugin System** - Extensible architecture with enrichment and destination plugin types
- **DestinationPlugin** - Plugins that route events to specific endpoints
- **MiddlewarePayload** - Data structure for event processing middleware
- **Autocapture** - Automatic tracking of sessions, app lifecycles, screen views, and user interactions

### Identity and Device Management
- **deviceId** - Unique device identifier, can use App Set ID
- **ADID** - Advertising ID tracking with privacy controls
- **sessionTimeoutMillis** - Session boundary configuration
- **groupType/groupName** - Group-based analytics organization

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The Android SDKs integrate with several Amplitude platform components:

**Amplitude Data** - The tracking plan management system that defines event schemas used by Ampli for code generation via `ampli pull` and `ampli status` commands.

**Amplitude HTTP v2 API** - The backend ingestion endpoint that receives events from both SDKs, with support for EU data residency through `setServerZone` configuration.

**Google Play Store Integration** - Revenue verification system for validating in-app purchase events through `logRevenueV2` methods.

**Network and Connectivity** - Integration with OkHTTP for network requests, offline mode support with network state monitoring, and SSL pinning capabilities through `PinnedAmplitudeClient`.

## API Endpoints and CLI Commands

### CLI Commands
- `ampli pull` - Downloads latest tracking plan and generates typed client code
- `ampli status` - Validates local implementation against tracking plan schema

### Configuration Methods
- `setServerZone()` - Configure EU data residency
- `enableForegroundTracking()` - Enable automatic session management
- `enableCoppaControl()` - Enable COPPA compliance mode
- `enableLocationListening()` - Enable automatic location tracking
- `setOffline()` - Control offline mode behavior
- `setUseDynamicConfig()` - Enable dynamic configuration updates

### Package Dependencies
- **Legacy**: `com.amplitude:android-sdk` via Maven Central
- **Modern**: `com.amplitude:analytics-android` via Maven Central
- **Required**: OkHTTP dependency for network operations
- **Integration**: AndroidManifest.xml permissions and ProGuard configuration exceptions

The ecosystem supports advanced features including Jetpack Compose element tracking, network connectivity monitoring, and comprehensive privacy controls through COPPA compliance and granular tracking options.
