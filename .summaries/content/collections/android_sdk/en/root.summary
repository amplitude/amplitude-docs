# Amplitude Android SDK Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude offers analytics tracking solutions for Android applications through two main SDK variants:

1. **Android-Kotlin SDK** (`com.amplitude:analytics-android`) - The actively developed, modern SDK built for Kotlin-first development with full Java support.
2. **Android SDK** (`com.amplitude:android-sdk`) - The legacy SDK in maintenance mode, not receiving new features.

The SDKs enable developers to track user behavior, identify users, manage sessions, and capture events in Android applications. They support both automatic event capture and manual event tracking with customizable properties.

## Product Relationships and Features

### SDK Variants and Status

- **Android-Kotlin SDK**: The current, actively developed SDK that uses a plugin architecture for extensibility. It's built with Kotlin but fully supports Java applications.
- **Android SDK**: The legacy SDK in maintenance mode, still functional but not receiving new features. Developers are encouraged to migrate to the Android-Kotlin SDK.
- **Ampli Wrapper**: A code-generated layer that sits on top of either SDK to provide type-safe analytics based on tracking plans defined in Amplitude Data.

### Core Features Across SDKs

1. **Event Tracking**
   - Manual event tracking with custom properties
   - Automatic event capture (screen views, app lifecycle events)
   - Revenue tracking for purchase events

2. **User Management**
   - User identification with unique IDs
   - User property tracking and updates
   - Cross-platform user identity management

3. **Session Management**
   - Automatic session tracking
   - Configurable session timeouts
   - Background/foreground transition handling

4. **Device Information**
   - Device ID management
   - Optional advertising ID tracking
   - Device properties collection

5. **Data Management**
   - Offline event storage
   - Batched event uploading
   - Event filtering and transformation

6. **Privacy Controls**
   - EU data residency support
   - COPPA compliance options
   - Opt-out mechanisms

### Android-Kotlin SDK Specific Features

- Plugin architecture for extensibility
- Network tracking plugin for HTTP request monitoring
- Element interaction tracking
- Improved configuration API
- Better type safety with Kotlin

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Ampli Wrapper**: A code-generated SDK wrapper that provides type-safe analytics based on tracking plans.
- **Tracking Plan**: A schema that defines expected events and their properties.
- **Device ID**: A unique identifier for the device, persisted across app installations.
- **User ID**: A custom identifier set by the application to identify a specific user.
- **Event**: An action or occurrence tracked in the application.
- **Identify**: Operations that update user properties without sending events.
- **Group**: A collection of users that can be analyzed together.
- **Session**: A period of continuous user engagement with the app.
- **Middleware**: Components that can intercept and modify events before they're sent.
- **Plugin**: Modular components that extend SDK functionality in the Android-Kotlin SDK.
- **Flush**: The process of sending batched events to Amplitude servers.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Android SDKs integrate with the broader Amplitude ecosystem:

1. **Amplitude Analytics**: The SDKs send data to Amplitude Analytics for visualization and analysis.
2. **Amplitude Data**: Provides tracking plans that can be used with the Ampli Wrapper for type-safe analytics.
3. **Experiment**: Can be used alongside the SDKs for A/B testing and feature flagging.
4. **Cross-Platform Identity**: The SDKs support Amplitude's cross-platform user identity system.

The Ampli Wrapper connects with Amplitude Data through the `ampli` CLI tool, which can pull tracking plan updates and check implementation status.

## API Endpoints and Commands

### Android-Kotlin SDK Key Methods

```kotlin
// Initialization
val amplitude = Amplitude(Configuration(
    apiKey = "YOUR-API-KEY",
    context = applicationContext
))

// Event tracking
amplitude.track("Event Name", mapOf("property" to "value"))

// User identification
amplitude.setUserId("user@example.com")
amplitude.identify(Identify().set("property", "value"))

// Group operations
amplitude.setGroup("groupType", "groupName")
amplitude.groupIdentify("groupType", "groupName", Identify().set("property", "value"))

// Flush events
amplitude.flush()
```

### Ampli CLI Commands

```bash
# Pull tracking plan updates
ampli pull

# Check implementation status
ampli status
```

### Migration Path

When migrating from the legacy Android SDK to the Android-Kotlin SDK, developers need to:

1. Update dependencies from `com.amplitude:android-sdk` to `com.amplitude:analytics-android`
2. Replace initialization code with the new Configuration object
3. Update method calls according to the new API (e.g., `logEvent()` to `track()`)
4. Adapt to the new plugin architecture for custom functionality

The migration documentation provides detailed mapping between old and new APIs to facilitate this transition.
