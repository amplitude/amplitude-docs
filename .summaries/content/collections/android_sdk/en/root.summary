# Amplitude Android SDK Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude's Android SDK is a comprehensive analytics tracking solution for Android applications, available in two main versions:

1. **Android-Kotlin SDK** (`com.amplitude:analytics-android`) - The latest, actively developed SDK written in Kotlin with modern architecture
2. **Android SDK** (`com.amplitude:android-sdk`) - The legacy SDK in maintenance mode

Both SDKs enable developers to track user events, manage user identities, track revenue, and capture session data in Android applications. The SDKs integrate with Amplitude's analytics platform to provide insights into user behavior and application performance.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Core Analytics Capabilities
- **Event Tracking**: Record user actions and behaviors
- **User Identification**: Associate events with specific users
- **User Properties**: Track and update user attributes
- **Revenue Tracking**: Monitor in-app purchases and revenue events
- **Session Management**: Track user engagement sessions
- **Offline Support**: Queue events when offline and send when connectivity returns

### Advanced Features
- **Autocapture** (Android-Kotlin SDK): Automatically track sessions, app lifecycles, screen views, deep links, and element interactions
- **Plugin Architecture** (Android-Kotlin SDK): Extensible system for adding functionality
- **Middleware** (Legacy SDK): Intercept and modify events before sending
- **COPPA Compliance**: Controls for children's privacy protection
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Server-side configuration options

## Product Relationships and Architecture

### SDK Versions and Relationship
- **Android-Kotlin SDK**: Modern replacement with plugin architecture, written in Kotlin
- **Legacy Android SDK**: Original implementation in maintenance mode
- **Migration Path**: Official migration guide available for transitioning between versions

### Ampli Wrapper
- A code-generated layer that sits on top of either SDK
- Provides strongly typed APIs based on Amplitude Data tracking plans
- Enforces event schemas to prevent instrumentation errors
- Offers autocompletion for events and properties

### Integration with Amplitude Ecosystem
- Sends data to Amplitude Analytics platform
- Supports multiple destinations through plugins
- Compatible with Amplitude's Data tracking plan system

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Core Concepts
- **Event**: A discrete user action or occurrence tracked in the application
- **User Properties**: Attributes associated with a user (e.g., name, email)
- **Device ID**: Unique identifier for the device, with configurable lifecycle management
- **User ID**: Custom identifier for authenticated users
- **Session**: A period of continuous user engagement with the app
- **Batch**: Collection of events sent together to optimize network usage

### Plugin Types (Android-Kotlin SDK)
- **DestinationPlugin**: Sends event data to specific endpoints
- **EnrichmentPlugin**: Adds or modifies event data before sending
- **UtilityPlugin**: Provides additional functionality without modifying events

## API and Implementation Details

### Android-Kotlin SDK Key Methods
- `Amplitude.getInstance().init()`: Initialize the SDK
- `track()`: Record an event
- `identify()`: Set or update user properties
- `setGroup()`: Associate user with a group
- `groupIdentify()`: Set or update group properties
- `flush()`: Force send queued events
- `reset()`: Clear user identity and properties

### Ampli Wrapper Key Methods
- `ampli.load()`: Initialize the Ampli wrapper
- `ampli.identify()`: Identify users with strongly typed properties
- `ampli.track()`: Track events with type checking
- `ampli.flush()`: Force send events
- `ampli pull`: CLI command to pull tracking plan
- `ampli status`: CLI command to check tracking plan status

### Configuration Options
- Event batching and upload frequency
- Session timeout duration
- Tracking opt-out controls
- Offline event queuing limits
- Server endpoint customization
- Location tracking permissions
- Advertising ID and App Set ID collection

## Implementation Examples

### Android-Kotlin SDK Initialization
```kotlin
val amplitude = Amplitude(
    Configuration(
        apiKey = AMPLITUDE_API_KEY,
        context = applicationContext
    )
)
```

### Event Tracking
```kotlin
amplitude.track(
    "Button Clicked",
    mapOf("buttonColor" to "blue", "buttonText" to "Submit")
)
```

### User Identification
```kotlin
val identifyObj = Identify()
identifyObj.set("email", "user@example.com")
identifyObj.set("name", "User Example")
amplitude.identify(identifyObj)
```

The Android SDK provides a robust solution for tracking and analyzing user behavior in Android applications, with the Android-Kotlin SDK representing the modern, recommended implementation path for new projects.
