# Revenue LTV in Amplitude

Revenue LTV (Long-Term Value) is an analytics feature available in Amplitude for Growth and Enterprise plan customers that enables businesses to track and analyze new user monetization over a 12-month period. This specialized chart type provides critical insights into how newly acquired users generate revenue over time.

## Key Features and Concepts

- **New User Monetization Focus**: Revenue LTV specifically analyzes monetization patterns for new users only, treating them as a single cohort to track their revenue generation over time.

- **12-Month Analysis Period**: The chart tracks monetization metrics for up to 12 months after user acquisition.

- **Cumulative Metrics**: The chart displays cumulative metrics over time, showing the total value generated by new users as they progress through their lifecycle.

- **Key Monetization Metrics**:
  - **Total Revenue**: Cumulative revenue generated by new users
  - **New Paying Users**: Count of new users who have made a purchase
  - **ARPU** (Average Revenue Per User): Total revenue divided by total users
  - **ARPPU** (Average Revenue Per Paying User): Total revenue divided by paying users

- **Day Zero Measurement**: The chart begins tracking from the day of user acquisition (Day 0), providing visibility into immediate monetization behavior.

## Implementation Requirements

To use Revenue LTV effectively, proper revenue event tracking must be implemented:

1. **Revenue Event Tracking**: Must be set up through Amplitude's SDKs or custom implementation.

2. **logRevenueV2() Method**: The recommended method for tracking revenue events in Amplitude SDKs.

3. **Required Revenue Properties**:
   - `$revenue`: The monetary amount of the transaction
   - Additional optional properties for deeper analysis

4. **Revenue Authentication**: Ensures accurate revenue tracking and prevents manipulation.

## Analysis Capabilities

- **User Segmentation**: Analyze monetization patterns across different user segments.

- **Cohort Analysis**: Compare monetization performance between different cohorts of new users.

- **Conversion Tracking**: Monitor how new users convert to paying customers over time.

- **Breakdown Table**: View detailed metrics broken down by user acquisition date.

## Interpretation Considerations

- **Timeframe Impact**: The timing of when users make payments affects metrics like ARPU and ARPPU.

- **Cumulative Nature**: The chart shows cumulative values, helping to understand the total value generated over time rather than periodic snapshots.

- **New Users Only**: The analysis focuses exclusively on new users, not returning or existing users.
