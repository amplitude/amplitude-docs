# Revenue LTV in Amplitude

Revenue LTV (Lifetime Value) is an Amplitude feature that helps businesses analyze and track monetization patterns for new users over time. Available exclusively to Growth and Enterprise plan customers, this tool provides critical insights into how effectively new users convert to paying customers and their revenue contribution over a 12-month period.

## Key Features and Capabilities

- **New User Monetization Analysis**: Tracks revenue metrics specifically for new users by treating them as a single cohort
- **12-Month Tracking Period**: Monitors monetization patterns for up to 12 months after user acquisition
- **Cumulative Revenue Visualization**: Shows how revenue accumulates over time from new user cohorts
- **Key Metrics Tracking**: Measures Total Revenue, New Paying Users, ARPU (Average Revenue Per User), and ARPPU (Average Revenue Per Paying User)
- **Custom Segmentation**: Allows breakdown of metrics by user properties for targeted analysis

## Core Metrics and Definitions

- **Total Revenue**: The cumulative revenue generated by new users over time
- **New Paying Users**: Count of new users who have made a purchase
- **ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)**: Total revenue divided by total number of users
- **ARPPU (Average Revenue Per Paying User)**: Total revenue divided by number of paying users
- **Day Zero**: The first day a user appears in your data, used as the starting point for cohort analysis
- **Cohort Expansion**: How the user cohort grows and changes over the analysis period

## Implementation Requirements

Revenue LTV charts rely on properly implemented revenue tracking in your application:

- **Revenue Events**: Must use the `logRevenueV2()` method or equivalent to track revenue transactions
- **Required Properties**: Each revenue event must include the `$revenue` property
- **Optional Properties**: Can include additional properties like product ID, quantity, and revenue type
- **Authentication**: Revenue events should be properly authenticated for accurate user attribution

## Data Interpretation Considerations

When analyzing Revenue LTV charts, several important factors should be considered:

1. **Attribution Model**: Revenue is attributed to the day when the payment occurred, not when the user first appeared
2. **Cohort Definition**: Only includes new users within the specified time period
3. **Timeframe Impact**: Different timeframe selections (day, week, month) affect how data is grouped and displayed
4. **Data Completeness**: Longer timeframes provide more complete LTV pictures but require more historical data

## Integration with Amplitude Ecosystem

Revenue LTV charts complement other Amplitude analytics features:

- Works alongside standard Amplitude charts for comprehensive product analytics
- Can be used with other monetization tracking features for complete revenue analysis
- Supports the same segmentation capabilities as other Amplitude charts
- Can be included in dashboards and reports for regular monitoring

## API and Implementation

To implement revenue tracking for LTV analysis:

```javascript
// Example of revenue logging with the Amplitude SDK
amplitude.logRevenueV2({
  price: 3.99,           // Required: price of the product
  quantity: 1,           // Required: quantity of products purchased
  productId: 'com.company.app.productid', // Optional: product identifier
  revenueType: 'purchase' // Optional: type of revenue
});
```

This implementation ensures that revenue data is properly captured for accurate LTV analysis in the Amplitude platform.
