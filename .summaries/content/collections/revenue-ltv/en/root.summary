# Revenue LTV in Amplitude

Revenue LTV (Long-Term Value) is an Amplitude feature available to Growth and Enterprise plan customers that enables businesses to analyze monetization patterns of new users over time. The feature provides critical insights into how effectively new users convert to paying customers and their revenue contribution over a 12-month period.

## Key Features and Concepts

- **New User Monetization Analysis**: Focuses exclusively on new users, treating them as a single cohort to track their revenue generation over time
- **12-Month Tracking Period**: Monitors user monetization patterns for up to 12 months after acquisition
- **Cumulative Revenue Metrics**: Shows how revenue accumulates from new users over their lifecycle
- **Daily Frequency Breakdown**: Provides granular day-by-day analysis of revenue metrics
- **Segmentation Capabilities**: Allows filtering by user properties to compare monetization across different user segments

## Core Metrics Tracked

1. **Total Revenue**: Cumulative revenue generated by new users over time
2. **New Paying Users**: Count of new users who made purchases
3. **ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)**: Total revenue divided by total new users
4. **ARPPU (Average Revenue Per Paying User)**: Total revenue divided by paying users only

## Implementation Requirements

The Revenue LTV chart requires proper implementation of revenue tracking in your application:

- Must use the `logRevenueV2()` method or equivalent for tracking revenue events
- Revenue events must include the `$revenue` property with the transaction amount
- Revenue authentication must be properly configured
- User properties should be set up for effective segmentation

## Chart Interpretation

The Revenue LTV chart displays:

- **X-axis**: Time since user acquisition (days/weeks/months)
- **Y-axis**: Cumulative value of the selected metric
- **Data points**: Each point represents the cumulative value for all users who have reached that specific time point

### Important Considerations

1. **Partial Data Points**: The most recent data points may show drops as fewer users have reached those time points
2. **Acquisition Timeframe**: Users are grouped based on when they first used the product
3. **Cohort Analysis**: All new users are treated as a single cohort regardless of when they were acquired
4. **Breakdown Table**: Provides detailed metrics for each time point, including daily and cumulative values

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Revenue LTV is part of Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem, specifically focused on monetization analysis. It complements other Amplitude features by:

- Providing specialized monetization insights for new users
- Supporting business decisions around user acquisition and retention strategies
- Enabling ROI analysis for marketing campaigns
- Helping optimize conversion funnels for paid features

## Key Nomenclature

- **LTV (Long-Term Value)**: The projected revenue a customer will generate over their entire relationship with the business
- **ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)**: Total revenue divided by total number of users
- **ARPPU (Average Revenue Per Paying User)**: Total revenue divided by number of paying users
- **New Users**: First-time users of the product within the selected timeframe
- **Paying Users**: Users who have completed at least one revenue-generating transaction
- **Cohort**: A group of users who share a common characteristic, in this case, being new users

The Revenue LTV feature is specifically designed to help businesses understand the long-term revenue potential of their user acquisition efforts and optimize their monetization strategies accordingly.
