## Amplitude Revenue LTV Analytics

Amplitude's Revenue LTV is a specialized analytics feature designed to track and analyze monetization patterns for new user cohorts. This cohort-based revenue analysis system focuses exclusively on understanding how newly acquired users generate revenue over time, providing critical insights for user acquisition strategies and lifetime value optimization.

## Core Product Features and Functionality

The Revenue LTV chart operates as a dedicated monetization analysis tool that tracks revenue events from new users across defined time periods. The system automatically groups users into cohorts based on their first-seen date and measures their cumulative revenue contribution over time. Key analytical measures include:

- **Total Revenue**: Aggregate revenue generated by cohorts
- **New Paying Users**: Count of users making their first purchase
- **ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)**: Revenue averaged across all users in a cohort
- **ARPPU (Average Revenue Per Paying User)**: Revenue averaged across only paying users

The system supports lookback periods of up to 12 months and provides daily frequency breakdowns for granular analysis, including specialized tracking like 48th hour revenue measurement and Day Zero calculation logic.

## Technical Implementation and Data Architecture

Revenue tracking centers around the `[Amplitude] Any Revenue Event` with the required `$revenue` property. The system integrates with Amplitude's SDK through the `logRevenueV2()` method, which captures comprehensive revenue data including:

- `$price`: Individual item cost
- `$productId`: Product identifier
- `$quantity`: Purchase quantity
- `$revenueType`: Revenue categorization

The platform includes a revenue authentication system to ensure data integrity and supports automatic currency conversion for global implementations. The system is specifically designed to handle in-app purchases (IAPs) and other digital revenue streams.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Cohort-Based Analysis**: Users are grouped by their first-seen date, creating time-based cohorts for comparative analysis across acquisition periods.

**Cumulative Revenue Calculation**: Revenue is measured as running totals from the cohort start date, allowing for lifetime value progression tracking.

**New-User Focus**: The system exclusively analyzes users from their first interaction, filtering out existing user revenue to maintain cohort purity.

**Data Drops**: A systematic limitation where recent cohorts may show incomplete data due to insufficient user tenure, particularly near timeframe endpoints.

**Breakdown Table Expansion**: Interactive functionality allowing detailed drill-down into cohort performance metrics and revenue event visualization.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Revenue LTV operates within Amplitude's broader analytics platform as a specialized module for Growth and Enterprise plan subscribers. The feature integrates with Amplitude's core event tracking infrastructure, leveraging the same SDK and data pipeline used for behavioral analytics while applying revenue-specific processing logic.

The system connects to Amplitude's standard user identification and segmentation capabilities, allowing revenue analysis to be combined with behavioral cohorts and user properties. This integration enables comprehensive user journey analysis from acquisition through monetization.

The Revenue LTV charts complement Amplitude's other analytics tools by providing monetization context to user behavior patterns, supporting data-driven decisions around user acquisition costs, retention strategies, and product pricing optimization.
