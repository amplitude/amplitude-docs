## Amplitude Revenue LTV Analytics

Amplitude's Revenue Long-Term Value (LTV) feature provides comprehensive analytics for tracking and analyzing new user monetization patterns over extended time periods. This specialized chart type focuses on cohort-based revenue analysis, enabling businesses to understand how newly acquired users generate revenue over their lifecycle, typically measured across 12-month horizons.

## Product Relationships and Features

The Revenue LTV chart integrates deeply with Amplitude's core analytics platform, specifically designed for Growth and Enterprise plan customers. The feature operates as a specialized visualization within Amplitude Analytics, leveraging the platform's event tracking infrastructure to provide monetization insights. The chart works in conjunction with Amplitude's broader user segmentation and cohort analysis capabilities, allowing businesses to break down revenue performance across different user groups and acquisition channels.

The Revenue LTV functionality connects to Amplitude's SDK implementation through the `logRevenueV2()` method, which captures detailed transaction data and feeds into the analytics engine. This creates a seamless flow from revenue event capture to analytical insights, supporting both in-app purchases (IAPs) and other revenue streams.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Revenue LTV Chart**: A specialized analytics visualization that tracks cumulative revenue generated by new user cohorts over time, typically spanning 12-month periods.

**`[Amplitude] Any Revenue Event`**: The primary event type used for revenue tracking, automatically capturing all monetization activities within an application.

**Revenue Properties**: Core data attributes including:
- `$revenue`: The monetary value of transactions
- `$price`: Individual item pricing
- `$productId`: Product identification
- `$quantity`: Transaction volume
- `$revenueType`: Revenue categorization
- `$eventProperties`: Additional transaction metadata

**ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)**: Calculated metric showing average revenue generated across all users in a cohort, including non-paying users.

**ARPPU (Average Revenue Per Paying User)**: Calculated metric showing average revenue generated specifically from users who made purchases.

**Day Zero Measurement**: The methodology for establishing baseline measurements at the point of user acquisition or cohort formation.

**Single Cohort Treatment**: The analytical approach where each user cohort is analyzed independently to track revenue progression over time.

**Cumulative Revenue Tracking**: The system's ability to aggregate revenue data across multiple time periods, showing total lifetime value progression.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The Revenue LTV feature operates as a critical component within Amplitude's comprehensive product analytics ecosystem. It connects with the platform's user identification and segmentation systems, enabling businesses to correlate revenue performance with user behavior patterns, acquisition channels, and product engagement metrics. The feature supports currency conversion capabilities, making it suitable for global applications with multi-currency revenue streams.

The Revenue LTV charts integrate with Amplitude's authentication system to ensure revenue data accuracy and prevent fraud, while supporting breakdown table expansion for detailed analysis. The feature is designed to work alongside other Amplitude analytics tools, providing monetization context to user journey analysis, retention studies, and product optimization efforts.

## Technical Implementation

The Revenue LTV functionality relies on the `logRevenueV2()` SDK method for data collection, which captures comprehensive transaction details and revenue properties. The system processes this data through cohort-based calculations, tracking how revenue accumulates over time for specific user groups.

The charts support daily frequency breakdowns and provide detailed interpretation guidance for understanding data patterns, including potential data drops near timeframe endpoints due to insufficient user tenure for complete analysis. The 48th hour revenue calculation methodology ensures accurate short-term revenue attribution while supporting long-term trend analysis.

The feature includes sophisticated data processing capabilities that handle new user cohorts, paying user segmentation, and cumulative total revenue calculations, all while maintaining the flexibility to analyze different time horizons and user segments based on business requirements.
