# Revenue LTV in Amplitude

Revenue LTV is an Amplitude feature that helps businesses analyze and track monetization patterns for new users over time. Available exclusively to Growth and Enterprise plan customers, this tool provides critical insights into how effectively new users convert to paying customers and their long-term revenue contribution.

## Key Features and Concepts

- **New User Cohort Analysis**: Revenue LTV treats new users as a single cohort and tracks their cumulative revenue generation over time (up to 12 months)
- **Key Monetization Metrics**:
  - **Total Revenue**: Cumulative revenue generated by new users
  - **New Paying Users**: Count of new users who have made a purchase
  - **ARPU** (Average Revenue Per User): Total revenue divided by total new users
  - **ARPPU** (Average Revenue Per Paying User): Total revenue divided by paying users

## Technical Implementation

### Revenue Event Tracking
Revenue LTV relies on properly instrumented revenue events using the `logRevenueV2()` method with the following properties:
- `$revenue`: The revenue amount (required)
- Revenue authentication properties (for verification)
- Custom event properties (for segmentation)

### Data Calculation Methodology

- **Day Zero Calculation**: The first day a user appears in your data becomes their "Day 0"
- **Cumulative Metrics**: All metrics are calculated cumulatively from Day 0 onward
- **Data Point Calculation**: Each data point represents the cumulative value for all users who have reached that specific day in their user journey

## Interpretation Guidelines

### Chart Interpretation
- The x-axis represents days since a user first appeared in your data
- The y-axis shows the cumulative value of the selected metric
- Data points represent the average cumulative value for all users who have reached that specific day

### Important Considerations
- **End-of-Timeframe Drops**: Metrics may appear to drop near the end of the selected timeframe because fewer users have reached those later days
- **Segmentation Analysis**: Use the breakdown table to compare performance across different user segments
- **Timeframe Selection**: Longer timeframes provide more complete LTV insights but require more historical data

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Revenue LTV complements Amplitude's broader analytics suite by focusing specifically on monetization patterns for new users, helping businesses:
- Evaluate the effectiveness of user acquisition strategies
- Identify high-value user segments
- Optimize monetization approaches
- Project long-term revenue potential from new user cohorts

The feature is accessible through Amplitude's chart interface for customers on Growth and Enterprise plans.
