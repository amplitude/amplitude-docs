# Revenue LTV in Amplitude

Revenue LTV (Long-Term Value) is an Amplitude feature available to Growth and Enterprise plan customers that enables businesses to analyze monetization patterns of new users over time. This feature provides critical insights into how effectively new users convert to paying customers and their revenue contribution over a 12-month period.

## Key Features and Concepts

- **New User Monetization Analysis**: Focuses exclusively on new users, treating them as a single cohort to track their revenue generation over time
- **12-Month Tracking Period**: Monitors user monetization patterns for up to 12 months after acquisition
- **Cumulative Revenue Metrics**: Shows how revenue accumulates from new users over their lifecycle
- **Daily Frequency Breakdown**: Provides granular day-by-day analysis of revenue metrics
- **Segmentation Capabilities**: Allows filtering by user properties to compare monetization across different user segments

## Core Metrics Tracked

1. **Total Revenue**: Cumulative revenue generated by new users over time
2. **New Paying Users**: Count of new users who made purchases
3. **ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)**: Total revenue divided by total new users
4. **ARPPU (Average Revenue Per Paying User)**: Total revenue divided by paying users only

## Product Relationships and Features

Revenue LTV is part of Amplitude's monetization analytics suite, designed specifically for tracking the long-term value of newly acquired users. It works in conjunction with:

- Amplitude's core analytics platform for user behavior tracking
- Revenue tracking systems that implement the `logRevenueV2()` method
- User property management for segmentation capabilities
- Cohort analysis features for comparative analysis

The feature creates a specialized view that isolates new user revenue patterns, complementing other Amplitude charts that might focus on overall revenue or retention metrics.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **LTV (Long-Term Value)**: The projected revenue a customer will generate over their entire relationship with the business
- **ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)**: Total revenue divided by total number of users
- **ARPPU (Average Revenue Per Paying User)**: Total revenue divided by number of paying users
- **New Users**: First-time users of the product within the selected timeframe
- **Paying Users**: Users who have completed at least one revenue-generating transaction
- **Cohort**: A group of users who share a common characteristic, in this case, being new users
- **logRevenueV2()**: The API method required for tracking revenue events in Amplitude

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Revenue LTV integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem by:

- Providing specialized monetization insights that complement user engagement metrics
- Supporting business decisions around user acquisition and retention strategies
- Enabling ROI analysis for marketing campaigns
- Helping optimize conversion funnels for paid features

The feature is particularly valuable for subscription-based businesses, freemium applications, and e-commerce platforms that need to understand the long-term revenue impact of user acquisition efforts.

To use Revenue LTV, customers must:

- Implement the `logRevenueV2()` method or equivalent for tracking revenue events
