Available exclusively to Growth and Enterprise plan customers, this specialized chart type provides critical insights into how newly acquired users generate revenue throughout their lifecycle.

## Core Monetization Metrics

Revenue LTV tracks four primary metrics:
- **Total Revenue**: Cumulative revenue generated by new users
- **New Paying Users**: Count of new users who have made a purchase
