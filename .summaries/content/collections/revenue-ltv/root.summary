## Amplitude Revenue LTV Analytics

Amplitude Revenue LTV is a specialized cohort-based analytics feature that tracks monetization patterns exclusively for newly acquired users. The system provides critical insights for user acquisition strategies and lifetime value optimization by analyzing how new user cohorts generate revenue over time periods up to 12 months.

## Core Features and Analytical Capabilities

The Revenue LTV chart functions as a dedicated monetization analysis tool that automatically groups users into cohorts based on their first-seen date and measures cumulative revenue contribution over time. The system provides four key analytical measures:

- **Total Revenue**: Aggregate revenue generated by user cohorts
- **New Paying Users**: Count of users making their first purchase within the cohort
- **ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)**: Revenue averaged across all users in a cohort, including non-paying users
- **ARPPU (Average Revenue Per Paying User)**: Revenue averaged exclusively across paying users

The platform supports daily frequency breakdowns for granular analysis, including specialized tracking capabilities like 48th hour revenue measurement and Day Zero calculation logic. Interactive breakdown table expansion allows detailed drill-down into cohort performance metrics and revenue event visualization.

## Technical Implementation and Data Architecture

Revenue tracking is built around the `[Amplitude] Any Revenue Event` with the mandatory `$revenue` property. The system integrates with Amplitude's SDK through the `logRevenueV2()` method, capturing comprehensive revenue data including:

- `$price`: Individual item cost
- `$productId`: Product identifier  
- `$quantity`: Purchase quantity
- `$revenueType`: Revenue categorization

The platform includes a revenue authentication system to ensure data integrity and supports automatic currency conversion for global implementations. The architecture is specifically optimized for tracking in-app purchases (IAPs) and other digital revenue streams.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Cohort-Based Analysis**: Users are systematically grouped by their first-seen date, creating time-based cohorts that enable comparative analysis across different acquisition periods.

**Cumulative Revenue Calculation**: Revenue is measured as running totals from the cohort start date, providing lifetime value progression tracking over extended periods.

**New-User Focus**: The system exclusively analyzes users from their first interaction, applying filters to exclude existing user revenue and maintain cohort purity for accurate acquisition analysis.

**Data Drops**: A systematic limitation where recent cohorts may display incomplete data due to insufficient user tenure, particularly affecting analysis near timeframe endpoints.

**Lookback Periods**: Configurable time windows up to 12 months that define the duration for tracking cohort revenue performance.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Revenue LTV operates as a specialized module within Amplitude's analytics platform, available exclusively to Growth and Enterprise plan subscribers. The feature leverages Amplitude's core event tracking infrastructure, utilizing the same SDK and data pipeline architecture used for behavioral analytics while applying revenue-specific processing logic.

The system integrates with Amplitude's standard user identification and segmentation capabilities, enabling revenue analysis to be combined with behavioral cohorts and user properties. This integration supports comprehensive user journey analysis spanning from initial acquisition through monetization milestones.

Revenue LTV charts complement Amplitude's broader analytics suite by providing monetization context to user behavior patterns, enabling data-driven decisions around user acquisition costs, retention strategies, and product pricing optimization. The cohort-based approach aligns with Amplitude's user-centric analytics philosophy while addressing specific monetization analysis requirements for growth teams and product managers focused on lifetime value optimization.
