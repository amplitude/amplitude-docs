# Revenue LTV in Amplitude

Revenue LTV is an Amplitude feature available to Growth and Enterprise plan customers that enables businesses to analyze monetization patterns of new users over time. The feature provides critical insights into how effectively new users convert to paying customers and their revenue contribution over a 12-month period.

## Key Features and Concepts

- **New User Monetization Analysis**: Tracks how new users generate revenue over time by treating them as a single cohort
- **12-Month Tracking Period**: Monitors monetization metrics for up to 12 months after user acquisition
- **Cumulative Revenue Metrics**: Shows progressive revenue accumulation rather than isolated time periods
- **Daily Frequency Breakdown**: Provides granular day-by-day analysis of revenue metrics
- **Segmentation Capabilities**: Allows filtering by user properties to compare monetization across different user segments

## Core Metrics Tracked

1. **Total Revenue**: Cumulative revenue generated by the new user cohort
2. **New Paying Users**: Count of users who made their first purchase
3. **ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)**: Total revenue divided by total users
4. **ARPPU (Average Revenue Per Paying User)**: Total revenue divided by paying users

## Implementation Requirements

Revenue LTV requires proper implementation of revenue tracking in your application using:

- The `logRevenueV2()` method
- Revenue event properties with a `$revenue` property
- Revenue authentication for accurate tracking

## Chart Interpretation

The Revenue LTV chart displays:

- **X-axis**: Time since user acquisition (days/weeks/months)
- **Y-axis**: Cumulative value of the selected metric
- **Data points**: Each point represents the cumulative value up to that time period

### Important Considerations

- Data points are calculated based on users who have had sufficient time to reach that point in their lifecycle
- Metrics may appear to drop near the end of the timeframe due to fewer users reaching those later points
- The breakdown table provides detailed metrics for each time period
- User acquisition timeframe affects the cohort composition and subsequent analysis

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Revenue LTV works within Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem:

- Complements other Amplitude charts for comprehensive user behavior analysis
- Integrates with Amplitude's segmentation capabilities for targeted analysis
- Supports the overall product strategy by connecting acquisition to monetization

## Nomenclature and Definitions

- **LTV (Lifetime Value)**: The predicted revenue a user will generate throughout their relationship with the product
- **New Users**: First-time users within the selected timeframe
- **Cohort**: A group of users who share a common characteristic (in this case, being new users)
- **ARPU**: Average Revenue Per User, calculated as total revenue divided by total users
- **ARPPU**: Average Revenue Per Paying User, calculated as total revenue divided by paying users
- **Cumulative Metrics**: Progressive totals that accumulate over time rather than isolated period values
