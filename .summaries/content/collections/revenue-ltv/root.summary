# Revenue LTV in Amplitude

Revenue LTV is a specialized analytics feature in Amplitude that enables businesses to analyze and track monetization patterns for new users over time. This feature is exclusively available to customers on Growth and Enterprise plans, providing critical insights into user conversion to paying customers and their long-term revenue contribution.

## Product Overview

Revenue LTV treats new users as a cohort and tracks their cumulative revenue generation over a period of up to 12 months. The feature focuses on four key monetization metrics:

- **Total Revenue**: The cumulative revenue generated by new users
- **New Paying Users**: The count of new users who have made a purchase
- **ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)**: Total revenue divided by total new users
- **ARPPU (Average Revenue Per Paying User)**: Total revenue divided by paying users

The tool helps businesses evaluate user acquisition strategies, identify high-value user segments, optimize monetization approaches, and project long-term revenue potential from new user cohorts.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

Revenue LTV is integrated within Amplitude's broader analytics suite, specifically focusing on monetization patterns. It relies on properly instrumented revenue events using the `logRevenueV2()` method, which requires:
- A required `$revenue` property indicating the revenue amount
- Revenue authentication properties for verification
- Optional custom event properties for segmentation

The feature processes this revenue data using a specific calculation methodology:
1. Identifies each user's "Day 0" (first appearance in data)
2. Calculates metrics cumulatively from Day 0 onward
3. Represents each data point as the cumulative value for all users who have reached that specific day

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **LTV (Lifetime Value)**: The projected revenue a customer will generate throughout their relationship with the business
- **ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)**: Total revenue divided by total users
- **ARPPU (Average Revenue Per Paying User)**: Total revenue divided by paying users
- **Cohort**: A group of users who share a common characteristic (being new users in this context)
- **Day Zero**: The first day a user appears in the data
- **Revenue Event**: An event that tracks a monetary transaction

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Revenue LTV complements Amplitude's analytics suite by providing specialized monetization insights. While standard Amplitude analytics focus on user behavior and engagement, Revenue LTV specifically addresses the financial value of users over time.

The feature is accessible through Amplitude's chart interface for Growth and Enterprise plan customers. It works alongside other Amplitude features to provide a comprehensive view of user value, connecting behavioral analytics with financial outcomes.

## Technical Implementation

To implement Revenue LTV tracking, developers must use the `logRevenueV2()` method to record revenue events with the appropriate properties. The data is then processed by Amplitude's analytics engine to generate the LTV charts and metrics.

When interpreting Revenue LTV charts:
- The x-axis represents days since a user first appeared in the data
- The y-axis shows the cumulative value of the selected metric
- Data points represent the average cumulative value for all users who have reached that specific day

Users should be aware that metrics may appear to drop near the end of the selected timeframe because fewer users have reached those later days in their journey. For the most accurate LTV insights, longer timeframes are recommended, though these require more historical data.
