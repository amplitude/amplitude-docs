## Amplitude Revenue LTV Analytics

Amplitude Revenue LTV Analytics is a specialized cohort-based revenue analysis tool that tracks and analyzes new user monetization patterns over extended time periods, typically across 12-month horizons. This feature enables businesses to understand how newly acquired users generate revenue throughout their lifecycle, providing critical insights into customer lifetime value and monetization effectiveness.

## Product Relationships and Features

Revenue LTV operates as a specialized visualization within Amplitude Analytics, exclusively available to Growth and Enterprise plan customers. The feature integrates deeply with Amplitude's core analytics platform, leveraging the existing event tracking infrastructure to deliver monetization insights. It functions as part of Amplitude's broader cohort analysis and user segmentation ecosystem, enabling businesses to dissect revenue performance across different user groups, acquisition channels, and behavioral segments.

The Revenue LTV chart works in conjunction with Amplitude's user identification systems and connects seamlessly with the platform's SDK implementation. This integration creates a comprehensive flow from revenue event capture through the `logRevenueV2()` method to analytical visualization, supporting both in-app purchases (IAPs) and diverse revenue streams across global, multi-currency applications.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Revenue LTV Chart**: A specialized analytics visualization tracking cumulative revenue generated by new user cohorts over time, with standard 12-month measurement periods.

**`[Amplitude] Any Revenue Event`**: The primary automated event type capturing all monetization activities within applications, serving as the foundation for revenue tracking.

**Revenue Properties**: Core transaction data attributes including:
- `$revenue`: Monetary transaction value
- `$price`: Individual item pricing
- `$productId`: Product identification codes
- `$quantity`: Transaction volume/quantity
- `$revenueType`: Revenue stream categorization
- `$eventProperties`: Additional transaction metadata

**ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)**: Calculated metric showing average revenue across all cohort users, including non-paying users, providing broad monetization performance indicators.

**ARPPU (Average Revenue Per Paying User)**: Calculated metric focusing specifically on revenue from users who completed purchases, offering insights into paying user value.

**Day Zero Measurement**: The analytical methodology establishing baseline measurements at user acquisition or cohort formation points.

**Single Cohort Treatment**: The analytical approach treating each user cohort independently to track revenue progression and lifecycle patterns.

**Cumulative Revenue Tracking**: The system's capability to aggregate revenue data across multiple time periods, demonstrating total lifetime value progression and trends.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Revenue LTV functions as a critical monetization component within Amplitude's comprehensive product analytics ecosystem. It integrates with the platform's user identification, segmentation, and authentication systems to ensure data accuracy and prevent fraud. The feature correlates revenue performance with user behavior patterns, acquisition channels, product engagement metrics, and retention studies.

The tool supports currency conversion capabilities for global applications and provides breakdown table expansion for granular analysis. Revenue LTV charts complement other Amplitude analytics tools by adding monetization context to user journey analysis, product optimization efforts, and growth strategy development. The feature works alongside Amplitude's broader cohort analysis capabilities, enabling businesses to understand not just user behavior but the financial impact of that behavior over time.

## Technical Implementation

Revenue LTV relies on the `logRevenueV2()` SDK method for comprehensive data collection, capturing detailed transaction information and revenue properties. The system processes this data through sophisticated cohort-based calculations that track revenue accumulation patterns for specific user groups over time.

The implementation supports daily frequency breakdowns and includes detailed interpretation guidance for understanding data patterns. The system accounts for potential data drops near timeframe endpoints due to insufficient user tenure for complete analysis. The 48th hour revenue calculation methodology ensures accurate short-term revenue attribution while maintaining support for long-term trend analysis.

Technical capabilities include advanced data processing for new user cohorts, paying user segmentation, and cumulative total revenue calculations. The system maintains analytical flexibility to examine different time horizons and user segments based on specific business requirements, while ensuring data integrity through Amplitude's authentication and fraud prevention systems.
