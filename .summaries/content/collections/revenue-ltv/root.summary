## Revenue LTV Product Overview

Revenue LTV is Amplitude's specialized analytics feature for tracking and analyzing new user monetization patterns through cohort-based revenue analysis. The product focuses exclusively on new-user cohorts to provide insights into how recently acquired users generate revenue over time, supporting business decisions around user acquisition, pricing strategies, and monetization optimization.

## Product Features and Relationships

The Revenue LTV system centers around the **Revenue LTV chart**, which serves as the primary analytical interface for monetization analysis. This chart integrates with Amplitude's core event tracking system through the `[Amplitude] Any Revenue Event` and leverages the `$revenue` property to capture monetary transactions.

The product supports four key measurement types:
- **Total Revenue**: Cumulative revenue generated by cohorts
- **New Paying Users**: Count of users making their first purchase
- **ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)**: Revenue divided by total cohort size
- **ARPPU (Average Revenue Per Paying User)**: Revenue divided by paying users only

These measures work together to provide comprehensive monetization insights, with ARPU showing overall cohort value and ARPPU indicating spending behavior among converted users.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Revenue Events**: Tracked through `[Amplitude] Any Revenue Event` with associated properties including `$price`, `$productId`, `$quantity`, `$revenueType`, and `$eventProperties`. Implementation uses the `logRevenueV2()` method for proper revenue attribution.

**Cohort Logic**: Users are grouped by their first event trigger in Amplitude, with "Day Zero" representing the 48-hour period following initial user registration or first app interaction.

**Cumulative Revenue Calculation**: Revenue accumulates over time periods, allowing analysis of user value progression from initial engagement through extended lifecycles up to 12 months.

**Cohort Breakdown Table**: Provides granular analysis of individual cohorts with daily frequency breakdown capabilities for detailed monetization pattern identification.

**Timeframe Endpoint Data Drops**: A systematic limitation where recent cohorts may show incomplete data due to insufficient user tenure for complete lifecycle analysis.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Revenue LTV operates within Amplitude's broader analytics platform, available specifically on Growth and Enterprise plans. The system integrates with:

- **Core Event Tracking**: Leverages Amplitude's fundamental event collection infrastructure
- **User Identification System**: Relies on Amplitude's user tracking for cohort formation
- **Currency Conversion**: Supports multi-currency revenue tracking with automatic conversion capabilities
- **Authentication System**: Includes revenue authentication mechanisms to ensure data integrity
- **In-App Purchase (IAP) Integration**: Specifically designed to work with mobile app monetization events

The product serves as a specialized layer within Amplitude's analytics suite, focusing on the critical business metric of new user revenue generation while maintaining integration with the platform's broader user behavior analysis capabilities. This positioning allows businesses to correlate monetization patterns with user engagement metrics tracked elsewhere in the Amplitude ecosystem.
