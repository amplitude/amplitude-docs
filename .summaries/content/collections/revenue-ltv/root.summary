# Revenue LTV in Amplitude

Revenue LTV (Lifetime Value) is a specialized analytics feature in Amplitude that enables businesses to track and analyze monetization patterns for new users over a 12-month period. This feature is exclusively available to customers on Growth and Enterprise plans, providing critical insights into user revenue contribution and conversion patterns.

## Product Overview and Key Features

Revenue LTV focuses on analyzing how effectively new users convert to paying customers and their revenue contribution over time by:

- Treating new users as a single cohort for monetization analysis
- Tracking revenue metrics for up to 12 months after user acquisition
- Visualizing cumulative revenue accumulation from new user cohorts
- Measuring critical monetization metrics including Total Revenue, New Paying Users, ARPU, and ARPPU
- Supporting custom segmentation by user properties for targeted analysis

## Product Relationships and Ecosystem Integration

Revenue LTV is positioned within Amplitude's analytics ecosystem as a specialized monetization analysis tool that:

- Complements standard Amplitude analytics charts for comprehensive product insights
- Works alongside other monetization tracking features for complete revenue analysis
- Supports the same segmentation capabilities as other Amplitude charts
- Can be incorporated into dashboards and reports for regular monitoring
- Requires proper implementation of Amplitude's revenue tracking functionality

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

The Revenue LTV feature uses specific terminology to describe its metrics and functionality:

- **Total Revenue**: Cumulative revenue generated by new users over the analysis period
- **New Paying Users**: Count of new users who have completed a purchase
- **ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)**: Total revenue divided by the total number of users
- **ARPPU (Average Revenue Per Paying User)**: Total revenue divided by the number of paying users
- **Day Zero**: The first day a user appears in the data, serving as the starting point for cohort analysis
- **Cohort Expansion**: The growth and evolution of the user cohort throughout the analysis period
- **Attribution Model**: Revenue is attributed to the day when payment occurred, not when the user first appeared

## Implementation Requirements

To utilize Revenue LTV effectively, proper revenue tracking implementation is required:

- Revenue events must use the `logRevenueV2()` method or equivalent
- Each revenue event must include the `$revenue` property
- Optional properties can include product ID, quantity, and revenue type
- Revenue events should be properly authenticated for accurate user attribution

## API Implementation Example

```javascript
// Example of revenue logging with the Amplitude SDK
amplitude.logRevenueV2({
  price: 3.99,           // Required: price of the product
  quantity: 1,           // Required: quantity of products purchased
  productId: 'com.company.app.productid', // Optional: product identifier
  revenueType: 'purchase' // Optional: type of revenue
});
```

## Data Interpretation Considerations

When analyzing Revenue LTV charts, users should consider:

1. The attribution model (revenue attributed to payment date)
2. Cohort definition (only includes new users within the specified period)
3. Timeframe impact (different selections affect data grouping and display)
4. Data completeness (longer timeframes provide more complete LTV pictures but require more historical data)

Revenue LTV serves as a critical tool for businesses seeking to understand the long-term value of their user acquisition efforts and optimize their monetization strategies based on user behavior patterns over time.
