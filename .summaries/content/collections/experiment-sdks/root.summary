## Amplitude Experiment SDK Suite

Amplitude Experiment is a comprehensive feature flagging and experimentation platform that provides client-side and server-side SDKs across multiple programming languages and platforms. The platform enables organizations to conduct A/B tests, feature rollouts, and targeted experiments through both remote and local evaluation methods.

## Product Architecture and Evaluation Methods

The Experiment platform operates through two primary evaluation modes:

**Remote Evaluation**: Client applications make API calls to Amplitude's servers to fetch experiment variants for users. This method provides real-time configuration updates but requires network connectivity and introduces latency.

**Local Evaluation**: Flag configurations are downloaded and cached locally, enabling client-side evaluation without network calls for each variant lookup. This approach offers better performance and offline capability while supporting advanced features like cohort targeting and automatic assignment tracking.

The **Experiment Evaluation Proxy** serves as a bridge solution, enabling local evaluation capabilities on platforms without native SDK support through a Docker-based service that handles assignment event tracking with 24-hour deduplication and hourly cohort synchronization.

## SDK Portfolio and Platform Coverage

### Client-Side SDKs
- **JavaScript SDK** (`@amplitude/experiment-js-client`): Browser-based implementation with npm/yarn installation
- **React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/experiment-react-native-client`): Cross-platform mobile development with async-storage dependency
- **Android SDK** (`experiment-android-client`): Native Android implementation via Maven Central
- **iOS SDK**: Native iOS implementation via CocoaPods/Swift Package Manager

### Server-Side SDKs
- **Node.js SDK** (`@amplitude/experiment-node-server`): Server-side JavaScript implementation
- **JVM SDK**: Java/Kotlin implementation supporting Maven/Gradle
- **Python SDK** (`amplitude-experiment`): Server-side Python implementation
- **PHP SDK**: Server-side PHP implementation (v7.4+)
- **Go SDK** (`github.com/amplitude/experiment-go-server`): Server-side Go implementation
- **Ruby SDK** (`amplitude-experiment`): Server-side Ruby gem

## Key Nomenclature and Concepts

**Deployment Key**: Authentication credential that identifies the experiment environment and enables SDK initialization.

**Variants**: The different versions or treatments that users can be assigned to within an experiment, accessed via the `variant()` method using flag keys.

**Flag Configurations**: The rules and settings that determine how experiments are evaluated, including targeting criteria, allocation percentages, and variant definitions.

**ExperimentUser**: User object containing identification and properties (user_id, device_id, user_properties, group_properties) used for experiment evaluation and targeting.

**Exposure Tracking**: Automatic or manual tracking of when users are exposed to experiment variants, essential for accurate experiment analysis.

**Cohort Targeting**: Advanced targeting capability that allows experiments to target specific user segments defined in Amplitude Analytics.

**Assignment Tracking**: Automatic logging of experiment assignments for analysis, with configurable providers and deduplication.

**Bootstrapping**: Pre-loading initial variant configurations to reduce initial load times and provide fallback values.

## Core API Methods and Operations

### Initialization Methods
- `initializeWithAmplitudeAnalytics()`: Integration with Amplitude Analytics for seamless user tracking
- Standard initialization with deployment keys for third-party analytics integration

### Evaluation Methods
- `fetch()`: Remote evaluation method that retrieves variants from Amplitude servers
- `start()`: Local evaluation initialization that downloads flag configurations
- `variant(flagKey)`: Retrieves the assigned variant for a specific experiment flag
- `evaluate()` / `evaluateV2()`: Server-side evaluation methods for local processing

### Configuration Methods
- `fetchOnStart`: Automatically fetch remote variants during initialization
- `pollOnStart`: Enable automatic polling for flag configuration updates
- `refreshFlagConfigs()`: Manual refresh of local flag configurations

## Integration Ecosystem

The Experiment platform integrates deeply with the broader Amplitude ecosystem:

**Amplitude Analytics Integration**: Native integration provides automatic user context sharing, device ID synchronization via AmplitudeCookie parsing, and seamless exposure event tracking.

**Third-Party Analytics Support**: Compatible with Segment, mParticle, and other analytics platforms through custom exposure tracking providers and user providers.

**Data Residency**: Configurable server zones (US/EU) via `ServerZone` configuration for compliance with data residency requirements.

**Deployment Infrastructure**: Support for Kubernetes via Helm charts (`evaluation-proxy-helm`), Docker deployments, and stateless service architectures with load balancer compatibility.

## Advanced Configuration Features

**Cohort Synchronization**: Server-side SDKs support `CohortSyncConfig` for targeting experiments based on Amplitude user segments, with configurable sync intervals and maximum cohort sizes.

**Assignment Configuration**: Customizable assignment tracking through `AssignmentConfig` and provider interfaces, enabling integration with custom analytics systems.

**Flag Streaming**: Real-time flag configuration updates via `StreamUpdates` for immediate experiment changes without polling delays.

**Account-Level Bucketing**: Support for group-based experiments using account or organization-level properties for B2B use cases.

**Automatic Exposure Tracking**: Configurable automatic tracking of variant exposures with custom `ExposureTrackingProvider` implementations for different analytics backends.
