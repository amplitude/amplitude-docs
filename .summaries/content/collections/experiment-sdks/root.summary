Amplitude Experiment is a comprehensive feature flagging and experimentation platform that enables A/B testing, feature toggles, and targeted feature rollouts across multiple programming languages and platforms. The platform provides sophisticated user segmentation capabilities through cohort targeting and operates on two primary evaluation models to balance performance with real-time accuracy.

## Product Architecture and Evaluation Models

The platform's core architecture centers on two distinct evaluation approaches:

**Remote Evaluation** performs real-time API calls to Amplitude's servers using deployment keys to fetch user-specific flag configurations. This ensures flags remain current but introduces network latency dependencies.

**Local Evaluation** downloads complete flag configurations to client applications for local processing, delivering superior performance through client-side evaluation. This model supports advanced capabilities including flag streaming, cohort synchronization, and automatic assignment tracking.

The **Evaluation Proxy** extends local evaluation capabilities to unsupported platforms through a Docker-deployed service (amplitudeinc/evaluation-proxy). This bridge service handles assignment event tracking with 24-hour deduplication windows and hourly cohort synchronization cycles.

## Core Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Deployment Keys** serve as authentication tokens for SDK instances, determining access scope for flag configurations. **Flag Keys** provide unique identifiers for specific feature flags within experimental frameworks. **Variants** represent the actual flag states or values returned to users during evaluation.

**ExperimentUser** objects encapsulate user identification and targeting properties, supporting user_properties, group_properties, and device_id fields for segmentation logic. **Cohort Targeting** enables sophisticated user segmentation through CohortSyncConfig with configurable maxCohortSize parameters and synchronization intervals.

**Assignment Tracking** automatically captures when users receive specific flag variants through configurable AssignmentConfig and DefaultAssignmentTrackingProvider implementations. **Exposure Tracking** records when users actually encounter flag-controlled features via ExposureTrackingProvider interfaces, distinguishing between assignment and actual feature interaction.

## Ecosystem Integration and Analytics Platform Connectivity

The platform maintains deep integration with **Amplitude Analytics** through initializeWithAmplitudeAnalytics methods, enabling automatic device ID synchronization via **AmplitudeCookie** parsing mechanisms. Third-party analytics integrations extend to **Segment Analytics** and **mParticle** platforms.

**ServerZone** configuration accommodates data residency requirements through ServerZone.US and ServerZone.EU options, each with corresponding serverUrl and cohortServerUrl endpoint configurations.

## Configuration Patterns and Deployment Architecture

SDKs support **bootstrapping** capabilities through initialVariants and initialFlags configuration, enabling immediate flag access before remote fetch operations complete. **Flag streaming** via StreamUpdates provides real-time configuration updates, while **polling intervals** controlled by flagConfigPollingIntervalMillis and FlagConfigPollingInterval parameters manage batch update frequencies.

The Evaluation Proxy deploys as stateless service instances behind load balancers, configured through YAML with project definitions containing apiKey, secretKey, and managementKey credentials. **Redis persistent storage** supports cohort data caching and assignment deduplication functionality.

## API Patterns and Method Signatures

Standard SDK interaction patterns include:

**Initialization Methods**: `initializeRemote()`, `initializeLocal()`, `ExperimentClient.initialize()`

**Evaluation Operations**: `fetch()`, `fetchV2()`, `evaluate()`, `evaluateV2()`, `start()`

**Variant Access**: `variant()`, `variant.value`, flag key-based retrieval mechanisms

**Lifecycle Management**: `start()`, `stop()`, `clear()`, `refreshFlagConfigs()`

The platform operates on port 3546 for proxy services and exposes management API endpoints for deployment updates and configuration management operations. The architecture supports both synchronous and asynchronous operation patterns across all supported programming languages and platforms.
