Amplitude Experiment is a comprehensive feature flagging and experimentation platform that provides SDKs across multiple programming languages and platforms for both client-side and server-side implementations. The platform enables developers to implement feature flags, run A/B tests, and manage feature rollouts with sophisticated targeting capabilities.

## Core Product Architecture

The Experiment platform operates through two primary evaluation modes:

**Remote Evaluation**: Fetches flag variants from Amplitude's servers in real-time, suitable for server-side implementations where network latency is acceptable. This mode uses the `fetch()` or `fetchV2()` methods to retrieve variants for specific users.

**Local Evaluation**: Downloads flag configurations locally and evaluates variants client-side, providing faster response times and offline capability. This mode uses `start()` and `evaluate()` methods, with automatic flag configuration polling and streaming updates.

The **Evaluation Proxy** serves as a bridge service for platforms without native SDK support, deployed as a Docker container (`amplitudeinc/evaluation-proxy`) that provides local evaluation capabilities with automatic assignment tracking and 24-hour deduplication.

## SDK Ecosystem and Platform Coverage

The platform provides comprehensive SDK coverage across major development platforms:

**Client-Side SDKs**: JavaScript (`@amplitude/experiment-js-client`), iOS (CocoaPods/SPM), Android (Maven Central), React Native (`@amplitude/experiment-react-native-client`)

**Server-Side SDKs**: Node.js (`@amplitude/experiment-node-server`), Python (`amplitude-experiment`), JVM (Java/Kotlin), Ruby (`amplitude-experiment`), PHP, Go (`github.com/amplitude/experiment-go-server`)

Each SDK maintains consistent API patterns while adapting to platform-specific conventions and capabilities.

## Key Nomenclature and Concepts

**Deployment Key**: Authentication credential that identifies the specific experiment environment and enables SDK initialization.

**Variants**: The different versions or treatments of a feature flag that users can receive, containing payload data and configuration.

**ExperimentUser**: User object containing identification and properties (user_id, device_id, user_properties, group_properties) used for flag evaluation and targeting.

**Exposure Tracking**: Automatic or manual tracking of when users are exposed to flag variants, essential for experiment analysis. Implemented through `ExposureTrackingProvider` interfaces.

**Cohort Targeting**: Advanced targeting capability that syncs user cohorts from Amplitude Analytics for sophisticated audience segmentation in local evaluation mode.

**Assignment Tracking**: Automatic tracking of flag assignments with deduplication, configurable through `AssignmentConfig` and custom `AssignmentTrackingProvider` implementations.

**Bootstrapping**: Pre-loading flag configurations through `initialVariants` to reduce initial load times and provide fallback behavior.

## Integration Patterns and Provider Interfaces

The platform emphasizes flexible integration through provider interfaces:

**Analytics Integration**: Native integration with Amplitude Analytics via `initializeWithAmplitudeAnalytics()`, plus support for third-party analytics platforms (Segment, mParticle) through custom `ExposureTrackingProvider` implementations.

**User Management**: `ExperimentUserProvider` interface enables dynamic user context management, particularly useful for client-side implementations where user state changes frequently.

**Cookie Integration**: `AmplitudeCookie` utilities across server-side SDKs enable device ID synchronization between client and server implementations.

## Configuration and Deployment Options

**Server Zones**: Support for US (`ServerZone.US`) and EU (`ServerZone.EU`) data residency requirements with corresponding endpoint configurations.

**Polling and Streaming**: Configurable flag configuration updates through `flagConfigPollingIntervalMillis` settings and real-time `streamUpdates` capabilities.

**Timeout and Retry**: Comprehensive network resilience through `fetchTimeoutMillis`, `fetchRetries`, and related configuration options.

**Account-Level Bucketing**: Advanced experimentation capability supporting group-level analysis and bucketing beyond individual users.

## API Endpoints and Methods

Core SDK methods follow consistent patterns:
- Initialization: `initialize()`, `initializeWithAmplitudeAnalytics()`
- Remote evaluation: `fetch()`, `fetchV2()`, `fetchAsync()`
- Local evaluation: `start()`, `evaluate()`, `evaluateV2()`
- Variant access: `variant()`, `all()` for retrieving flag values
- Configuration management: `refreshFlagConfigs()`, `stop()`

The Evaluation Proxy exposes REST endpoints on port 3546 for platforms requiring HTTP-based integration, with management API capabilities for deployment updates.

## Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Experiment integrates deeply with the broader Amplitude ecosystem, particularly Amplitude Analytics for user data, cohort management, and experiment analysis. The platform supports both standalone implementations and unified SDK approaches, enabling gradual adoption and flexible architecture patterns. The consistent provider interface pattern across SDKs facilitates custom integrations while maintaining platform-specific optimizations and capabilities.
