## Amplitude Experiment SDK Suite

Amplitude Experiment is a comprehensive feature flagging and experimentation platform that provides client-side and server-side SDKs across multiple programming languages and platforms. The platform enables organizations to implement feature flags, conduct A/B tests, and manage feature rollouts with sophisticated targeting capabilities including cohort-based segmentation.

## Product Architecture and Evaluation Modes

The Amplitude Experiment ecosystem operates through two primary evaluation modes:

**Remote Evaluation** fetches flag configurations and variants from Amplitude's servers in real-time via API calls. This mode ensures the most up-to-date flag states but requires network connectivity for each evaluation. Key methods include `fetch()`, `fetchV2()`, and `fetch_async()` depending on the SDK.

**Local Evaluation** downloads flag configurations to the client and performs evaluations locally, reducing latency and network dependencies. This mode supports advanced features like automatic flag configuration polling, streaming updates, and cohort synchronization. Key methods include `start()`, `evaluate()`, `evaluateV2()`, and `evaluate_v2()`.

The **Evaluation Proxy** serves as a Docker-based intermediary service that enables local evaluation capabilities on platforms without native SDK support, while providing automatic assignment event tracking with 24-hour deduplication and hourly cohort synchronization.

## Platform Coverage and SDK Implementations

### Client-Side SDKs
- **Android SDK**: Maven Central distribution (`experiment-android-client`) with Amplitude Analytics integration
- **iOS SDK**: CocoaPods and Swift Package Manager support with protocol-based provider interfaces
- **JavaScript SDK**: NPM package (`@amplitude/experiment-js-client`) supporting browser environments and SSR
- **React Native SDK**: Modern implementation with AsyncStorage dependency and Expo compatibility
- **React Native Legacy SDK**: Maintenance-mode version with iOS/Android-only support

### Server-Side SDKs
- **JVM SDK**: Java/Kotlin implementation supporting Maven/Gradle with CompletableFuture async operations
- **Node.js SDK**: (`@amplitude/experiment-node-server`) with comprehensive timeout and retry configurations
- **Python SDK**: (`amplitude-experiment`) supporting Python 3.6+ with async evaluation capabilities
- **PHP SDK**: Server-side implementation (PHP 7.4+) with PSR logger interface and Guzzle HTTP client
- **Ruby SDK**: Gem-based distribution with callback-style async operations and multi-architecture support
- **Go SDK**: (`github.com/amplitude/experiment-go-server`) with native Go concurrency patterns

## Key Nomenclature and Concepts

**Deployment Key**: Authentication credential that identifies the experiment environment and enables SDK initialization. Each SDK requires a deployment key for both remote and local evaluation modes.

**Flag Key/Variant**: Flags represent individual features or experiments, while variants contain the specific values or configurations returned for a given user evaluation.

**ExperimentUser**: Standardized user object containing user identification, properties, and group memberships used for targeting and bucketing decisions.

**Exposure Tracking**: Automatic or manual tracking of when users are exposed to specific flag variants, enabling accurate experiment analysis. Implemented through `ExposureTrackingProvider` interfaces.

**Bootstrapping**: Pre-loading initial flag configurations (`initialVariants`, `initialFlags`) to reduce initial load times and provide fallback values during network unavailability.

**Cohort Sync**: Local evaluation feature that synchronizes user cohort definitions from Amplitude for advanced targeting capabilities, configured through `CohortSyncConfig`.

**Assignment Tracking**: Automatic tracking of flag assignments for analytics purposes, typically configured through `AssignmentConfig` or `DefaultAssignmentTrackingProvider`.

## Integration Ecosystem

### Analytics Integration
The SDKs provide deep integration with **Amplitude Analytics** through methods like `initializeWithAmplitudeAnalytics()`, enabling automatic user context sharing and exposure event tracking. **Segment Analytics** integration is also supported across client-side SDKs.

### Device ID Synchronization
**AmplitudeCookie** parsing utilities across server-side SDKs enable device ID synchronization between client and server contexts, maintaining consistent user identification across evaluation modes.

### Configuration Management
**ServerZone** configuration supports both US and EU data residency requirements (`ServerZone.US`, `ServerZone.EU`). Flag configuration polling intervals, streaming updates, and timeout/retry behaviors are extensively configurable across all SDKs.

## Advanced Features and Configuration

**Account-Level Bucketing**: Group-based targeting using `group_properties` for organizational or account-level feature rollouts.

**Automatic Exposure Tracking**: Configurable automatic tracking of variant exposures with customizable provider interfaces for analytics integration.

**Flag Streaming**: Real-time flag configuration updates through streaming connections, reducing polling overhead in local evaluation mode.

**Fallback Mechanisms**: Comprehensive fallback variant support ensuring graceful degradation during network issues or configuration errors.

The platform supports sophisticated deployment patterns including stateless service architectures, Kubernetes Helm chart deployments, and load balancer configurations for high-availability production environments.
