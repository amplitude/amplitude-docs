Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics platform that provides organizations with integrated tools for product analytics, experimentation, data management, and user engagement. The platform enables teams to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights across the entire customer journey.

## Core Product Architecture

The Amplitude ecosystem consists of four interconnected products that form a unified analytics and optimization platform:

**Amplitude Analytics** functions as the foundational product analytics engine, providing multiple chart types and analysis methodologies. Key capabilities include Event Segmentation charts for behavioral pattern analysis, Funnel Analysis for conversion optimization, Retention Analysis for measuring product adoption, Stickiness Analysis for identifying power users, Journey Analysis for user path discovery, Data Tables for multi-dimensional analysis, and User Sessions analysis for engagement measurement.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers A/B testing and feature experimentation infrastructure, encompassing feature flag management, targeted rollouts, and Web Experimentation specifically designed for optimizing conversion rates in web experiences and single-page applications.

**Amplitude Data** serves as the data governance and management layer, providing data taxonomy design frameworks, warehouse-native functionality that enables direct querying of existing data warehouses while preserving Amplitude's analytical capabilities, and integration pipelines with external platforms including Google Ads and HubSpot.

**Amplitude Engage** provides user engagement and activation tools, including Guides and Surveys for in-product messaging, Session Replay for contextualizing user experiences, and Autocapture with visual labeling capabilities for tracking website interactions without manual instrumentation requirements.

## Product Relationships and Integration Points

The four core products operate as an integrated ecosystem where data flows seamlessly between components. Analytics serves as the foundational layer that feeds insights into Experiment for hypothesis-driven testing, while Data ensures proper governance and taxonomy across all products. Engage leverages insights from Analytics to deliver targeted user experiences and captures additional behavioral data that enriches the overall dataset.

The warehouse-native functionality in Amplitude Data represents a key architectural approach, allowing organizations to maintain their existing data infrastructure while extending Amplitude's analytical capabilities directly to their data warehouses. This creates a hybrid model where data governance, storage, and analysis can be distributed across on-premise and cloud environments.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Event Segmentation** refers to the foundational analysis method for understanding user behavior patterns by breaking down events across different user segments and properties.

**Funnel Analysis** represents the methodology for tracking user progression through defined conversion paths and identifying drop-off points.

**Retention Analysis** measures how users return to and continue engaging with a product over specified time periods.

**Stickiness Analysis** identifies power users by measuring the frequency of user engagement within defined time windows.

**Journey Analysis** encompasses tools for discovering and analyzing user paths through products, including both exploratory and confirmatory analysis modes.

**Session Replay** provides qualitative user experience insights through recorded user sessions that can be analyzed alongside quantitative metrics.

**Autocapture** represents automated event tracking functionality that captures website interactions without requiring manual instrumentation.

**Warehouse-native** describes Amplitude's capability to operate directly on data stored in customer data warehouses while maintaining full analytical functionality.

**Spaces** function as collaborative environments where teams can organize, share, and collaborate on analytics assets.

**Data Taxonomy** refers to the structured framework for organizing and governing data definitions, properties, and relationships across the platform.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates extensively with external platforms and tools to create a comprehensive analytics ecosystem. Native integrations include Google Ads for marketing performance analysis and attribution, HubSpot for customer journey personalization and lead scoring enhancement, and various data warehouse platforms for warehouse-native implementations.

The platform supports multiple integration patterns including direct API connections, data import/export capabilities, and embedded analytics functionality. The warehouse-native approach particularly enables organizations to maintain their existing data infrastructure investments while extending Amplitude's capabilities.

## API and Technical Implementation

While specific API endpoints are not detailed in the documentation, the platform supports programmatic access through various integration methods. The warehouse-native functionality suggests SQL-based querying capabilities directly against customer data warehouses. Autocapture implementation involves JavaScript-based tracking with visual labeling tools for event definition.

Web Experimentation includes implementation frameworks for single-page applications and conversion optimization workflows. Feature flag management in Amplitude Experiment provides programmatic control over feature rollouts and targeting.

## User Personas and Use Cases

The platform serves multiple organizational roles including product managers focused on user behavior analysis and feature performance, growth marketers optimizing conversion funnels and user acquisition, data analysts performing multi-dimensional analysis and building custom reports, and administrators managing platform governance and user access.

The Amplitude Academy provides structured learning paths tailored to these personas, offering both foundational analytics concepts and advanced implementation guidance. Certification programs validate expertise across different platform capabilities and use cases.
