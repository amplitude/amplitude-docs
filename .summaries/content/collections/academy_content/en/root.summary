**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational product analytics platform, offering multiple chart types and analysis methods including Event Segmentation charts for understanding user behavior patterns, Funnel Analysis for diagnosing conversion issues, Retention Analysis for measuring product adoption, Stickiness Analysis for identifying power users, Journey Analysis for discovering user paths, Data Tables for multi-dimensional analysis, and User Sessions analysis for measuring time spent in products.

**Amplitude Data** provides data governance and taxonomy management capabilities, focusing on data quality, taxonomy design, and warehouse-native functionality that allows direct querying of data warehouses while maintaining self-serve analytics capabilities.

**Amplitude Experiment** offers feature flagging and A/B testing functionality, including both traditional experimentation workflows and Web Experimentation for optimizing web experiences and single-page applications, with comprehensive feature flag management, targeted rollouts, and rollback capabilities.

**Amplitude Engage** delivers user engagement tools through Guides and Surveys for creating targeted, in-product messages that drive adoption, engagement, and retention.

## Key Analysis Methodologies and Features

The platform employs several specialized analysis approaches. **Event Segmentation** forms the foundation for understanding user behavior patterns through detailed event tracking and segmentation. **Funnel and Path Analysis** helps diagnose conversion issues by analyzing user movement throughout products. **Retention Analysis** measures how effectively products drive long-term user engagement and adoption. **Stickiness Analysis** identifies power users by analyzing regular usage patterns. **Journey Analysis** discovers and confirms the paths users take within products.

**Session Replay** provides contextual understanding of user experiences by recording actual user sessions. **Data Tables** enable multi-dimensional analysis by allowing examination of multiple metrics simultaneously. **User Sessions** analysis helps understand time spent in products and session-based behaviors.

## Technical Implementation and Integration

Amplitude supports multiple implementation approaches including traditional SDK-based tracking and **Autocapture with Visual Labeling** for automatically tracking website clicks without manual instrumentation. The platform offers **Warehouse-Native** capabilities that allow organizations to query data directly from their existing data warehouses while maintaining Amplitude's analytics interface.
