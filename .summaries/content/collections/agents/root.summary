## Product Overview

This is an AI-powered web analytics and conversion optimization platform built around specialized intelligent agents that provide automated insights and recommendations. The platform combines session replay technology, conversion optimization tools, and AI-driven analysis to help businesses understand and improve website performance through autonomous analytical modules.

## Agent Architecture and Feature Relationships

The platform operates through three core specialized AI agents that work in concert:

**Session Replay Deep Research Agent** serves as the behavioral analysis engine, processing user session recordings to identify friction points, map user journeys, and extract behavioral insights from actual user interactions.

**Website Conversion Optimization Agent** functions as the performance optimization engine, analyzing conversion funnels and identifying specific opportunities to improve conversion rates across different customer touchpoints and user flows.

**Dashboard Summary Agent** acts as the data synthesis layer, aggregating insights from the other agents and multiple data sources to provide executive-level KPIs and digestible performance summaries.

These agents operate autonomously but share data and insights, creating a comprehensive analytical ecosystem where behavioral insights from session replay inform conversion optimization strategies, while dashboard summaries provide oversight across all analytical domains.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Agents**: Autonomous AI-powered analytical modules that specialize in specific domains of web analytics, operating independently to generate insights and recommendations within their area of expertise.

**Blueprint**: The structural template system using "agent" blueprint architecture that defines content organization, metadata structure, and documentation framework for agent-specific functionality.

**Session Replay**: Recording and reconstruction technology that captures user interactions on websites, enabling detailed post-session behavioral analysis and user experience evaluation.

**Deep Research**: Advanced analytical processing that extends beyond surface-level metrics to provide comprehensive behavioral pattern analysis and actionable insights.

**Conversion Optimization**: Systematic analysis and improvement of user conversion paths, focusing on identifying and removing barriers to desired user actions.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The platform integrates multiple layers of functionality:

**Data Collection Layer** captures user interactions, conversion events, website performance metrics, and behavioral data across all customer touchpoints.

**AI Processing Layer** houses the specialized agents that process different aspects of collected data, with each agent maintaining domain expertise while sharing relevant insights with other system components.

**Presentation Layer** includes dashboard systems and reporting interfaces that surface insights from various agents in contextually appropriate formats for different stakeholder needs.

**Security Framework** provides enterprise-grade privacy controls, data protection compliance, secure transmission protocols, and access management systems.

## Implementation Framework

The platform includes structured onboarding and configuration processes:

- Agent-specific setup procedures for configuring tracking parameters and analytical focus areas
- Conversion goal establishment and KPI customization aligned with business objectives
