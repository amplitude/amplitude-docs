# Amplitude iOS SDK Product Overview

## Product Overview

The Amplitude iOS SDK is a comprehensive analytics solution for iOS applications that enables developers to track user behavior, events, and properties. The SDK is available in two versions: the newer Swift-based SDK (AmplitudeSwift) and the maintenance Objective-C-based SDK (Amplitude-iOS). The SDK provides capabilities for event tracking, user identification, revenue tracking, session management, and advanced features like middleware, plugins, and privacy controls.

## Key Features and Concepts

1. **Event Tracking**: Track user actions and behaviors with custom properties
2. **User Identification**: Associate events with specific users and manage user properties
3. **Revenue Tracking**: Monitor in-app purchases and revenue-generating activities
4. **Session Management**: Track user sessions with configurable timeout settings
5. **Autocapture Capabilities**: Automatically track sessions, app lifecycles, screen views, deep links, and user interactions
6. **Plugin Architecture**: Extend functionality through custom plugins
7. **Privacy Controls**: Support for COPPA compliance, EU data residency, and privacy manifests
8. **Offline Mode**: Queue events when offline and send when connectivity is restored
9. **Strongly-typed Events**: Use the Ampli wrapper for type-safe event tracking

## Product Relationships and Architecture

### SDK Variants

1. **iOS Swift SDK (AmplitudeSwift)**: The newer, Swift-based implementation with a plugin architecture and modern Swift features
2. **Maintenance iOS SDK (Amplitude-iOS)**: The legacy Objective-C-based SDK that is still maintained but not receiving new features
3. **Ampli Wrapper**: A code-generated wrapper that provides strongly-typed event tracking based on your tracking plan

### Integration Methods

1. **CocoaPods**: `pod 'AmplitudeSwift'` or `pod 'Amplitude'` (for legacy SDK)
2. **Swift Package Manager**: Add the package URL `https://github.com/amplitude/Amplitude-Swift`
3. **Carthage**: Add `github "amplitude/Amplitude-Swift"` to your Cartfile

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Event**: A user action or occurrence that you want to track
2. **User Properties**: Attributes associated with a user that persist across sessions
3. **Device ID**: A unique identifier for the device, automatically generated by the SDK
4. **User ID**: A custom identifier you assign to a user, typically after authentication
5. **Session**: A period of user engagement with your app, defined by configurable timeout settings
6. **Identify**: Operations that modify user properties without generating an event
7. **Track**: Operations that record events with optional properties
8. **Middleware**: Code that processes events before they're sent to Amplitude
9. **Plugin**: Modular components that extend the SDK's functionality
10. **Flush**: The process of sending queued events to Amplitude servers
11. **LoadOptions**: Configuration options used when initializing the SDK
12. **EventOptions**: Configuration options applied to individual events

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The iOS SDK integrates with the broader Amplitude ecosystem:

1. **Amplitude Dashboard**: Events tracked by the SDK appear in the Amplitude analytics dashboard
2. **Data Taxonomy**: Works with Amplitude's tracking plan and data taxonomy features
3. **Ampli CLI**: Command-line tool for generating type-safe event tracking code based on your tracking plan
4. **Experiment**: Can be integrated with Amplitude Experiment for A/B testing
5. **EU Data Residency**: Supports sending data to EU servers for compliance with European regulations

## API Endpoints and Commands

### Swift SDK Initialization

```swift
import AmplitudeSwift

let amplitude = Amplitude(
    configuration: Configuration(
        apiKey: "YOUR-API-KEY",
        defaultTracking: DefaultTrackingOptions(
            sessions: true,
            appLifecycles: true,
            screenViews: true,
            deepLinks: true
        )
    )
)
```

### Event Tracking

```swift
// Track a basic event
amplitude.track(eventType: "Button Clicked")

// Track with properties
amplitude.track(
    eventType: "Product Purchased",
    eventProperties: ["price": 10.99, "product_id": "abc123"]
)
```

### User Identification

```swift
// Set user ID
amplitude.setUserId(userId: "user@example.com")

// Set user properties
amplitude.identify(
    Identify()
        .set("premium", value: true)
        .set("plan_type", value: "annual")
)
```

### Ampli CLI Commands

```bash
# Pull tracking plan
ampli pull

# Check status
ampli status
```

### Revenue Tracking

```swift
let revenue = Revenue()
revenue.setProductId("com.company.app.productId")
revenue.setPrice(3.99)
revenue.setQuantity(3)
amplitude.revenue(revenue)
```

### Group Identification

```swift
amplitude.setGroup(groupType: "org", groupName: "engineering")
```
