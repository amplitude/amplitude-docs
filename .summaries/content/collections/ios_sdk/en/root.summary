## Amplitude iOS SDK Product Suite

The Amplitude iOS SDK product suite provides comprehensive analytics, experimentation, and session replay capabilities for iOS applications through multiple SDK offerings. The suite includes a maintenance iOS SDK (Amplitude-iOS), a modern iOS Swift SDK (Amplitude-Swift), a unified SDK wrapper, and the Ampli code generation tool for type-safe event tracking.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The iOS SDK ecosystem consists of four interconnected components:

**Core SDKs:**
- **Maintenance iOS SDK (Amplitude-iOS)**: Legacy SDK in maintenance mode supporting both Swift and Objective-C
- **iOS Swift SDK (Amplitude-Swift)**: Modern replacement with enhanced features, plugin architecture, and improved performance
- **Unified SDK (AmplitudeUnified)**: Beta wrapper that integrates Analytics, Experiment, and Session Replay SDKs with unified identity management

**Development Tools:**
- **Ampli Wrapper**: Code generation tool that creates strongly-typed event tracking methods from Amplitude tracking plans

The migration path flows from the maintenance SDK to the Swift SDK, with the unified SDK serving as the ultimate integration point for organizations requiring multiple Amplitude products. The Ampli wrapper can be used with any of the core SDKs to provide type-safe event tracking.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Concepts:**
- **Event Tracking**: Primary analytics function using `track()` (Swift SDK) or `logEvent()` (maintenance SDK)
- **User Identification**: Associating events with users via `identify()` with user properties
- **Device ID Management**: Automatic device identification using IDFA, IDFV, or custom identifiers
- **Session Tracking**: Automatic user session management with configurable timeout periods
- **Revenue Tracking**: Specialized event type for purchase and transaction data

**Technical Architecture:**
- **Plugin System**: Modern architecture in Swift SDK replacing middleware, supporting enrichment and destination plugins
- **Autocapture**: Automatic tracking of sessions, app lifecycles, screen views, element interactions, and network requests
- **Storage Providers**: Configurable data persistence (PersistentStorage in Swift SDK vs SQLite in maintenance SDK)
- **Tracking Plans**: Schema definitions for events that generate type-safe code via Ampli

**Configuration Objects:**
- **Configuration**: Main SDK setup object replacing direct initialization parameters
- **TrackingOptions**: Controls which device properties are collected
- **LoadOptions**: Ampli-specific configuration for code generation and validation

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The iOS SDK suite integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics and optimization platform:

**Data Pipeline Integration:**
- Events flow to Amplitude's HTTP v2 API endpoints for processing and analysis
- Support for EU data residency via `serverZone` configuration
- Real-time and batch data transmission with configurable flush policies

**Cross-Product Synchronization:**
- Unified SDK maintains consistent user identity across Analytics, Experiment, and Session Replay
- Shared user properties and session management across all integrated products
- Synchronized configuration and tracking options

**Privacy and Compliance:**
- Apple Privacy Manifest compliance with NSPrivacyTracking declarations
- COPPA compliance controls for applications serving minors
- Comprehensive opt-out and data control mechanisms
- SSL pinning support for enhanced security

## API Endpoints and Implementation Details

**Installation Methods:**
- CocoaPods: `pod 'AmplitudeSwift'` or `pod 'Amplitude'`
- Swift Package Manager: GitHub repository integration
- Carthage: Binary framework distribution

**Core API Methods:**
- Event tracking: `amplitude.track("EventName", eventProperties: properties)`
- User identification: `amplitude.identify(identify)`
- Revenue tracking: `amplitude.revenue(revenue)`
- Group management: `amplitude.setGroup(groupType: "team", groupName: "engineering")`
- Session control: `amplitude.flush()` for immediate data transmission

**Ampli CLI Commands:**
- `ampli pull`: Generate type-safe tracking code from plans
- `ampli status`: Verify implementation against tracking plan
- Installation: `npm install -g @amplitude/ampli`

**Configuration Parameters:**
- `flushQueueSize`: Number of events before automatic transmission
- `flushIntervalMillis`: Time-based transmission interval
- `minTimeBetweenSessionsMillis`: Session timeout configuration
- `minIdLength`: Minimum user/device ID validation length
- `migrateLegacyData`: Automatic data migration from maintenance SDK

The SDK suite provides comprehensive debugging through configurable log levels, offline mode support for network-constrained environments, and extensive customization options for enterprise deployments requiring specific data handling or privacy controls.
