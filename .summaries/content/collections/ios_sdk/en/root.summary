# Amplitude iOS SDK Product Overview

## Product Overview

The Amplitude iOS SDK is a comprehensive analytics solution for iOS applications, enabling developers to track user behavior, manage user identities, and analyze app performance. The SDK is available in two versions: the maintenance iOS SDK (Amplitude-iOS) and the newer iOS Swift SDK (AmplitudeSwift), with the latter being the recommended implementation for new projects.

Key features include:
- Event tracking with custom properties
- User identity management
- Revenue tracking
- Session management
- Automatic event tracking (screen views, app lifecycles, deep links)
- Plugin architecture for extensibility
- Offline data collection
- EU data residency support
- Privacy controls and COPPA compliance

## Product Relationships and Architecture

### SDK Versions

1. **Maintenance iOS SDK (Amplitude-iOS)**
   - Legacy Objective-C based SDK
   - Being phased out but still supported
   - Traditional monolithic architecture

2. **iOS Swift SDK (AmplitudeSwift)**
   - Modern Swift-based implementation
   - Plugin-based architecture for extensibility
   - Improved performance and type safety
   - Recommended for all new implementations

3. **Ampli Wrapper**
   - Built on top of the Swift SDK
   - Provides strongly-typed event tracking
   - Generated from your tracking plan
   - Ensures consistency between tracking plan and implementation

### Integration Options

The SDK can be integrated via multiple dependency managers:
- CocoaPods
- Swift Package Manager (SPM)
- Carthage

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: An action performed by a user in the application
- **Identify**: Operations that update user properties
- **Track**: Method to record events
- **User Properties**: Attributes associated with a specific user
- **Group**: Collection of users that share properties
- **Session**: A period of user engagement with the app
- **Device ID**: Unique identifier for the device
- **User ID**: Custom identifier for the user
- **Middleware**: Customizable pipeline for processing events before sending
- **Plugin**: Modular component that extends SDK functionality
- **Flush**: Process of sending queued events to Amplitude servers
- **Autocapture**: Automatic tracking of predefined events without manual instrumentation

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The iOS SDK integrates with the broader Amplitude ecosystem:

1. **Amplitude Analytics Platform**
   - Events tracked via the SDK appear in the Amplitude Analytics dashboard
   - Supports real-time analytics and visualization

2. **Ampli CLI**
   - Command-line tool for generating type-safe tracking code
   - Syncs with tracking plan defined in Amplitude
   - Validates implementation against the tracking plan

3. **Data Destinations**
   - Events can be forwarded to other platforms through Amplitude's data routing

4. **Experiment Integration**
   - Can be used with Amplitude Experiment for A/B testing

## API and Implementation Details

### Swift SDK Initialization

```swift
import AmplitudeSwift

let amplitude = Amplitude(
    configuration: Configuration(
        apiKey: "YOUR-API-KEY",
        defaultTracking: DefaultTrackingOptions(
            sessions: true,
            appLifecycles: true,
            screenViews: true,
            deepLinks: true
        )
    )
)
```

### Event Tracking

```swift
// Basic event tracking
amplitude.track(
    eventType: "Button Clicked",
    eventProperties: ["buttonColor": "blue"]
)

// With event options
amplitude.track(
    eventType: "Purchase",
    eventProperties: ["price": 10.99],
    options: EventOptions(userId: "user-123")
)
```

### User Identification

```swift
// Set user ID
amplitude.setUserId("user-123")

// Update user properties
amplitude.identify(
    Identify()
        .set("premium", value: true)
        .add("loginCount", value: 1)
)
```

### Ampli Wrapper Usage

```swift
// Initialize Ampli
let ampli = Ampli()
ampli.load(LoadOptions(client: AmplitudeSwift(apiKey: "API-KEY")))

// Track typed events
ampli.songPlayed(name: "Song Name", duration: 240)
```

### CLI Commands

```bash
# Pull tracking plan
ampli pull

# Check implementation status
ampli status
```

### Plugin System

```swift
// Add a custom plugin
amplitude.add(plugin: CustomPlugin())
```

The iOS SDK provides a flexible, powerful analytics solution for iOS applications, with the Swift SDK offering modern architecture and improved developer experience compared to the legacy SDK.
