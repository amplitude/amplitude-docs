## Amplitude iOS SDK Product Suite

The Amplitude iOS SDK ecosystem consists of multiple interconnected SDKs and tools designed to provide comprehensive analytics, experimentation, and user behavior tracking for iOS applications. The suite supports both Swift and Objective-C development across iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, and visionOS platforms.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

### Core SDK Evolution
The product suite represents an evolution from a maintenance-mode legacy SDK (Amplitude-iOS) to modern Swift-based implementations:

- **Legacy iOS SDK (Amplitude-iOS)**: Maintenance-only SDK with instance-based initialization using `logEvent` methods
- **iOS Swift SDK (Amplitude-Swift)**: Current production SDK featuring configuration-based initialization, plugin architecture, and `track` methods
- **Unified SDK (AmplitudeUnified)**: Beta wrapper that consolidates Analytics, Experiment, and Session Replay capabilities

### Ampli Code Generation Layer
The Ampli wrapper sits above the core SDKs, providing strongly-typed event tracking through code generation from Amplitude tracking plans. It generates type-safe event classes and methods that wrap the underlying SDK calls, ensuring compile-time validation of analytics implementation.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Core Concepts
- **Amplitude Instance**: The main SDK client object for tracking events and managing configuration
- **Configuration Object**: Initialization parameters including API keys, server zones, and feature flags
- **Event Tracking**: Core analytics functionality using `track()` method with BaseEvent objects
- **User Identification**: Identity management through `identify()` API with user properties
- **Device ID**: Unique device identifiers using IDFA/IDFV or custom implementations

### Advanced Features
- **Autocapture**: Automatic tracking of sessions, app lifecycles, screen views, element interactions, and network requests
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible system for enrichment and destination plugins
- **Revenue Tracking**: Specialized tracking for purchase events and revenue attribution
- **User Groups**: Segmentation functionality through `groupIdentify` APIs
- **Session Management**: Configurable session tracking with `minTimeBetweenSessionsMillis` parameters

### Privacy and Compliance
- **Tracking Options**: Granular control over data collection through `trackingOptions` configuration
- **COPPA Control**: Children's privacy compliance features
- **Apple Privacy Manifest**: Required privacy declarations for App Store compliance
- **Opt-out Controls**: User privacy controls through `setOptOut` functionality

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

### Multi-Platform Strategy
The iOS SDKs integrate with Amplitude's broader cross-platform analytics ecosystem, supporting consistent tracking across web, Android, and server-side implementations. The unified identity management ensures user journeys are tracked seamlessly across platforms.

### Amplitude Cloud Services
- **HTTP v2 API**: Modern event ingestion endpoint with improved performance
- **EU Data Residency**: `setServerZone` configuration for GDPR compliance
- **Tracking Plans**: Schema validation and code generation through Ampli CLI
- **Real-time Analytics**: Event processing and dashboard integration

### Development Workflow Integration
- **Ampli CLI**: Command-line tool for pulling tracking plans and generating type-safe code
- **Multiple Package Managers**: Support for CocoaPods, Swift Package Manager, and Carthage
- **Development Tools**: Status verification, debugging utilities, and migration assistance

## API Endpoints and Command Line Usage

### Ampli CLI Commands
- `ampli pull`: Downloads tracking plan and generates type-safe event classes
- `ampli status`: Verifies implementation against tracking plan schema

### Core SDK Methods
- **Initialization**: `Amplitude(configuration: Configuration)`
- **Event Tracking**: `amplitude.track(event: BaseEvent)`
- **User Identification**: `amplitude.identify(identify: Identify)`
- **Revenue Tracking**: `amplitude.revenue(revenue: Revenue)`
- **Session Management**: `amplitude.setSessionId(sessionId: Int64)`
- **Data Transmission**: `amplitude.flush()` for immediate event upload

### Configuration Parameters
- **Batching**: `flushQueueSize`, `flushIntervalMillis` for performance optimization
- **Session Tracking**: `minTimeBetweenSessionsMillis` for session boundary definition
- **Storage**: Custom storage providers and persistent data management
- **Network**: Offline mode detection and connectivity handling

The iOS SDK suite provides a comprehensive analytics solution that scales from simple event tracking to complex multi-product implementations with type safety, privacy compliance, and cross-platform consistency.
