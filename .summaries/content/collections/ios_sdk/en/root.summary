## Amplitude iOS SDK Product Suite

The Amplitude iOS SDK ecosystem consists of multiple interconnected SDKs and tools designed to provide comprehensive analytics, experimentation, and user behavior tracking capabilities for iOS applications. The suite includes both legacy and modern implementations, with a clear migration path toward newer, more robust architectures.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The iOS SDK ecosystem is structured in three main tiers:

**Core Analytics SDKs:**
- **iOS SDK (Amplitude-iOS)** - Legacy maintenance-mode SDK using instance-based architecture with SQLite storage
- **iOS Swift SDK (Amplitude-Swift)** - Modern replacement featuring plugin architecture, configuration-object initialization, and PersistentStorage
- **Unified SDK (AmplitudeUnified)** - Beta wrapper that consolidates Analytics, Experiment, and Session Replay SDKs under unified identity management

**Code Generation Layer:**
- **Ampli for iOS Swift SDK** - Strongly-typed wrapper that generates type-safe event tracking methods from Amplitude tracking plans, supporting both Swift and Objective-C implementations

**Migration Tools:**
- Comprehensive migration utilities for transitioning from legacy SQLite storage to PersistentStorage, API method updates (logEvent → track()), and architectural changes from middleware to plugin systems

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Tracking Concepts:**
- **track()** - Primary event logging method in modern SDK (replaces legacy logEvent)
- **identify()** - User property management API using AMPIdentify class for property operations
- **AMPRevenue** - Revenue tracking class for e-commerce analytics
- **setGroup/groupIdentify** - User segmentation and group property management

**Configuration Architecture:**
- **Configuration object** - Modern initialization pattern replacing instance() method calls
- **Plugin architecture** - Extensible system for enrichment and destination plugins (PluginType)
- **PersistentStorage** - Modern storage system replacing SQLite implementation
- **TrackingOptions** - Privacy and compliance controls for COPPA, IDFA, carrier, and location data

**Advanced Features:**
- **Autocapture** - Automatic tracking of sessions, app lifecycles, screen views, element interactions, and network requests
- **defaultTracking** - Legacy equivalent covering sessions, appLifecycles, screenViews, and deepLinks
- **Middleware/AMPMiddlewarePayload** - Legacy event processing system (replaced by plugins)

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The iOS SDK suite integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics and experimentation platform through several key mechanisms:

**API Infrastructure:**
- Migration from HTTP v1 to v2 API endpoints for improved performance and reliability
- EU data residency support via setServerZone configuration
- Remote configuration capabilities through enableAutoCaptureRemoteConfig

**Cross-Platform Consistency:**
- Ampli CLI tool (@amplitude/ampli npm package) for cross-platform tracking plan code generation
- Consistent event schema and user property management across platforms
- Unified identity management system in the beta Unified SDK

**Privacy and Compliance:**
- Apple privacy manifest (NSPrivacyTracking, NSPrivacyCollectedDataTypes) integration
- IDFA/IDFV plugin implementation for device identification
- SSL pinning and comprehensive tracking controls for regulatory compliance

## Installation and Implementation Methods

**Package Management:**
- CocoaPods integration with AmplitudeSwift pod
- Swift Package Manager support for Amplitude-Swift package
- Carthage compatibility for legacy workflows

**CLI Operations:**
- `ampli pull` command for tracking plan synchronization
- `ampli status` verification for implementation validation
- Configuration management through LoadOptions and EventOptions

**Platform Support:**
- iOS, tvOS, watchOS compatibility
- iOS extensions and App Clips support
- UIKit and SwiftUI framework integration
- Swift and Objective-C language support

The ecosystem provides a comprehensive analytics solution with clear upgrade paths, extensive customization options, and robust privacy controls while maintaining backward compatibility during the transition from legacy to modern implementations.
