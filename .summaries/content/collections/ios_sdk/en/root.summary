## Amplitude iOS SDK Product Suite

The Amplitude iOS SDK ecosystem consists of multiple interconnected SDKs and tools designed for comprehensive analytics, experimentation, and user behavior tracking on iOS platforms. The suite includes a maintenance iOS SDK (Amplitude-iOS), a modern Swift SDK (Amplitude-Swift), a code generation tool (Ampli), and a unified SDK wrapper that combines analytics, experimentation, and session replay capabilities.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The iOS SDK ecosystem follows a clear evolution path and integration strategy:

**Core SDKs:**
- **Amplitude-iOS (Maintenance Mode)**: The legacy Objective-C/Swift SDK using instance-based initialization and SQLite storage
- **Amplitude-Swift**: The modern Swift-first SDK featuring plugin architecture, configuration-object initialization, and PersistentStorage
- **Amplitude Unified SDK**: A beta wrapper that combines Analytics, Experiment, and Session Replay SDKs with unified identity management

**Development Tools:**
- **Ampli Wrapper**: Code generation tool that creates strongly-typed event tracking methods from Amplitude tracking plans, compatible with both legacy and modern SDKs

The migration path flows from Amplitude-iOS → Amplitude-Swift → Unified SDK, with each iteration improving architecture, performance, and developer experience.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Concepts:**
- **BaseEvent**: Modern event tracking object in Amplitude-Swift replacing the legacy `logEvent()` method
- **Configuration**: Object-based initialization pattern replacing instance-based setup
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible system for enrichment and destination plugins, replacing middleware
- **PersistentStorage**: Modern storage system replacing SQLite in legacy SDK
- **AutocaptureOptions**: Automated tracking configuration for sessions, app lifecycles, screen views, and element interactions

**Identity Management:**
- **Identify**: User property management system using `AMPIdentify` class (legacy) or `Identify` operations (modern)
- **setGroup/groupIdentifyWithGroupType**: Group analytics functionality for organizational user segmentation
- **IDFA/IDFV**: Apple identifier tracking with plugin-based implementation

**Revenue and Events:**
- **AMPRevenue**: Revenue tracking class for e-commerce analytics
- **EventOptions**: Configuration for individual events including deviceId, price, and quantity
- **TrackingOptions**: Privacy controls including COPPA compliance and selective data collection

**Configuration Parameters:**
- **flushQueueSize/flushIntervalMillis**: Batch processing controls for event transmission
- **minTimeBetweenSessionsMillis**: Session boundary definition
- **eventUploadThreshold/eventUploadPeriodSeconds**: Upload timing configuration
- **migrateLegacyData**: Automatic data migration from legacy SDK

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The iOS SDK suite integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics and experimentation platform:

**Analytics Integration:**
- HTTP v2 API endpoints for modern event transmission (upgraded from v1 in legacy SDK)
- EU data residency support via `setServerZone` configuration
- Real-time event tracking with offline mode support through `NetworkConnectivityCheckerPlugin`

**Experimentation Platform:**
- Experiment SDK integration via Unified SDK with `amplitude.experiment.fetch()`, `variant()`, and `exposure()` methods
- Remote configuration support through `enableAutoCaptureRemoteConfig`

**Session Replay:**
- iOS-exclusive Session Replay SDK integration with `startRecording()`/`stopRecording()` controls
- Configurable sampling rates via `sessionSampleRate` and `scrollSampleRate`

**Privacy and Compliance:**
- Apple Privacy Manifest requirements with `NSPrivacyTracking` declarations
- COPPA compliance controls through `TrackingOptions`
- SSL pinning and secure data transmission

## Installation and Implementation Methods

**Package Management:**
- CocoaPods: `pod 'Amplitude'` (legacy), `pod 'AmplitudeSwift'` (modern), `pod 'AmplitudeUnified'` (unified)
- Swift Package Manager: GitHub repository integration for all SDK variants
- Carthage: Binary framework distribution support

**CLI Tools:**
- Ampli CLI: `@amplitude/ampli` npm package for tracking plan code generation
- `ampli pull` command for downloading strongly-typed event definitions
- `ampli status` for tracking plan verification

**Platform Support:**
- iOS, tvOS, watchOS compatibility across all SDK versions
- iOS Extensions and App Clips support
- UIKit and SwiftUI framework integration
- Objective-C and Swift language support with interoperability

The ecosystem provides comprehensive analytics capabilities while maintaining backward compatibility and offering clear migration paths for developers transitioning between SDK generations.
