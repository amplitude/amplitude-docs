# Amplitude iOS SDK Product Overview

## Product Overview

The Amplitude iOS SDK is a comprehensive analytics solution for iOS applications that enables developers to track user behavior, manage user identities, and analyze app usage patterns. The SDK is available in multiple versions, including a maintenance version (Amplitude-iOS), a current Swift version (AmplitudeSwift), and specialized wrappers like Ampli and the Unified SDK that provide additional functionality.

Key features of the Amplitude iOS SDK include:
- Event tracking with rich metadata
- User identification and property management
- Revenue tracking
- Session management
- Group analytics
- Offline data collection
- Autocapture capabilities for network calls and UI interactions
- Plugin architecture for extensibility
- Integration with other Amplitude products (Experiment, Session Replay)

The SDK supports both Swift and Objective-C applications and can be installed via CocoaPods, Carthage, or Swift Package Manager.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Amplitude iOS SDK ecosystem consists of several related products:

1. **Amplitude-iOS** (Maintenance SDK): The legacy Objective-C based SDK that is still maintained but not actively developed.

2. **AmplitudeSwift** (Current SDK): The modern Swift-based SDK with enhanced features, plugin architecture, and improved performance.

3. **Ampli Wrapper**: A code-generated, strongly-typed wrapper for the Amplitude SDK that provides type-safe event tracking based on a tracking plan defined in Amplitude.

4. **Amplitude Unified SDK**: A wrapper that combines multiple Amplitude products (Analytics, Experiment, and Session Replay) into a single interface for easier integration.

The architecture follows a plugin-based approach in the newer SDKs, allowing for extensibility and customization. The SDKs handle event batching, offline storage, and synchronization with Amplitude's servers.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: An action that a user performs in the application, which can be tracked with properties.
- **Identify**: The process of associating events with a specific user and updating user properties.
- **User Properties**: Attributes associated with a user that persist across sessions.
- **Group**: A collection of users that can be analyzed together.
- **Session**: A period of user engagement with the app, defined by configurable timeout parameters.
- **Device ID**: A unique identifier for the device, used for tracking users across sessions.
- **User ID**: A custom identifier that you can set to identify a user across devices.
- **Tracking Plan**: A schema that defines the expected events and properties for an application.
- **Middleware**: Custom code that can intercept and modify events before they are processed.
- **Plugin**: Modular components that extend the functionality of the SDK.
- **Autocapture**: Automatic tracking of predefined events like network calls and UI interactions.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude iOS SDK integrates with the broader Amplitude product ecosystem:

1. **Analytics**: The core functionality for tracking events and user properties, which feeds data to the Amplitude Analytics platform.

2. **Experiment**: A/B testing and feature flagging capabilities that can be integrated through the Unified SDK.

3. **Session Replay**: Captures user sessions for playback and analysis, available through the Unified SDK.

The SDK also supports integration with other systems through:
- HTTP V2 API for sending events to Amplitude's servers
- Batch API support for efficient data transmission
- Custom storage options for persisting data locally
- Identity management that can be shared across Amplitude products

## API Endpoints and Usage Examples

### Initialization

**AmplitudeSwift:**
```swift
import AmplitudeSwift

let amplitude = Amplitude(
    configuration: Configuration(
        apiKey: "YOUR-API-KEY",
        defaultTracking: DefaultTrackingOptions(
            sessions: true,
            appLifecycles: true,
            deepLinks: true
        )
    )
)
```

**Ampli Wrapper:**
```swift
import Amplitude
import Ampli

// Initialize Ampli
let ampli = Ampli()
ampli.load(LoadOptions(
    client: {
        // Optional: Customize the underlying Amplitude client
        let amplitude = Amplitude(configuration: Configuration(apiKey: "YOUR-API-KEY"))
        return amplitude
    }
))
```

**Unified SDK:**
```swift
import AmplitudeUnified

let unified = AmplitudeUnified.getInstance(
    configuration: UnifiedConfiguration(
        apiKey: "YOUR-API-KEY",
        analyticsConfiguration: AnalyticsConfiguration(),
        experimentConfiguration: ExperimentConfiguration(),
        sessionReplayConfiguration: SessionReplayConfiguration()
    )
)
```

### Event Tracking

**AmplitudeSwift:**
```swift
amplitude.track(
    eventType: "Button Clicked",
    eventProperties: ["buttonColor": "blue", "buttonText": "Sign Up"]
)
```

**Ampli Wrapper:**
```swift
// Using a predefined event from the tracking plan
ampli.songPlayed(
    songId: "song-123",
    songName: "Bohemian Rhapsody",
    artist: "Queen"
)
```

### User Identification

```swift
// Set user ID
amplitude.setUserId("user@example.com")

// Update user properties
amplitude.identify(
    Identify()
        .set("plan", value: "premium")
        .add("loginCount", value: 1)
)
```

### Revenue Tracking

```swift
amplitude.revenue(
    Revenue()
        .setProductId("product-123")
        .setPrice(9.99)
        .setQuantity(1)
)
```

### Session Management

```swift
// Configure session timeout
let configuration = Configuration(
    apiKey: "YOUR-API-KEY",
    minTimeBetweenSessionsMillis: 30 * 60 * 1000 // 30 minutes
)
```

The SDK provides many more APIs for advanced use cases, including group identification, offline mode configuration, middleware implementation, and plugin development.

# Human: I need to understand the differences between the various iOS SDKs offered by Amplitude. Can you explain the key differences between the maintenance iOS SDK (Amplitude-iOS), the current iOS Swift SDK (AmplitudeSwift), the Ampli Wrapper, and the Unified SDK? When should I use each one?
