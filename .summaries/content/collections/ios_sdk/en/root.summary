## Amplitude iOS SDK Product Suite

The Amplitude iOS SDK ecosystem consists of multiple SDKs and tools designed to provide comprehensive analytics, experimentation, and user behavior tracking capabilities for iOS applications. The suite includes both legacy maintenance SDKs and modern Swift-based solutions, with support for both Swift and Objective-C development environments.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The iOS SDK ecosystem follows a hierarchical structure with three main tiers:

**Core SDKs:**
- **iOS SDK (Amplitude-iOS)** - Legacy maintenance mode SDK providing foundational analytics capabilities
- **iOS Swift SDK (Amplitude-Swift)** - Modern replacement SDK with enhanced features and plugin architecture
- **Unified SDK (AmplitudeUnified)** - Beta wrapper that integrates Analytics, Experiment, and Session Replay SDKs

**Developer Tools:**
- **Ampli Wrapper** - Code generation tool that creates strongly-typed event tracking methods from Amplitude tracking plans

**Specialized Components:**
- **Analytics SDK** - Core event tracking and user analytics
- **Experiment SDK** - A/B testing and feature flag management  
- **Session Replay SDK** - User session recording and playback (iOS-only)

The migration path flows from the legacy iOS SDK to the modern Swift SDK, with the Unified SDK serving as the ultimate integration point for organizations requiring multiple Amplitude products.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Concepts:**
- **Tracking Plans** - Structured schemas defining events and properties for consistent data collection
- **Autocapture** - Automatic collection of standard events (sessions, app lifecycles, screen views, element interactions, network requests)
- **Plugins** - Modular components for enrichment and destination customization in the plugin architecture
- **Device ID Types** - IDFA (Identifier for Advertisers), IDFV (Identifier for Vendor) for user identification
- **User Properties** - Persistent attributes associated with users via the identify API
- **Event Properties** - Contextual data attached to specific events
- **Revenue Tracking** - Specialized event type for monetary transaction recording

**Configuration Objects:**
- **Configuration** - Primary initialization object replacing instance-based patterns
- **TrackingOptions** - Controls for disabling specific data collection fields
- **LoadOptions** - Ampli-specific configuration for wrapper initialization
- **EventOptions** - Per-event configuration including deviceId, price, and quantity

**API Methods:**
- **track()** - Primary event logging method (replaces legacy logEvent)
- **identify()** - User property management
- **setGroup()/groupIdentify()** - User group assignment and group property management
- **flush()** - Force immediate event upload
- **setUserId()/setDeviceId()** - User identification management

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The iOS SDK suite integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics and experimentation platform through several mechanisms:

**Data Pipeline Integration:**
- Events flow to Amplitude's HTTP v2 API endpoint for processing
- Support for EU data residency through serverZone configuration
- Dynamic configuration capabilities for server-side settings management

**Cross-Product Identity Management:**
- Unified SDK provides synchronized user properties across Analytics, Experiment, and Session Replay
- Consistent user identification across all Amplitude products
- Group-based analytics for account-level insights

**Privacy and Compliance Framework:**
- Apple Privacy Manifest compliance with NSPrivacyTracking and NSPrivacyCollectedDataTypes declarations
- COPPA compliance controls for applications serving minors
- Comprehensive opt-out and tracking disable capabilities
- SSL pinning support for enhanced security

## Installation and Implementation

**Package Managers:**
All SDKs support installation via CocoaPods, Swift Package Manager (SPM), and Carthage with specific package identifiers:
- `AmplitudeSwift` for the modern iOS Swift SDK
- `AmplitudeUnified` for the Unified SDK
- Legacy `Amplitude-iOS` for maintenance mode SDK

**CLI Tools:**
- `@amplitude/ampli` npm package provides CLI for code generation
- `ampli pull` command generates strongly-typed tracking methods
- `ampli status` verification for implementation validation

**Key API Endpoints and Methods:**
- `amplitude.track(event)` - Primary event tracking
- `amplitude.identify(identify)` - User property management  
- `amplitude.experiment.fetch()` - Feature flag retrieval
- `amplitude.sessionReplay.startRecording()` - Session recording initiation
- `ampli.songPlayed()` - Example of generated strongly-typed event method

The ecosystem supports advanced features including offline mode with automatic retry, session management with configurable timeouts, middleware for custom data processing, and comprehensive debugging capabilities through configurable log levels.
