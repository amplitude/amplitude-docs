## Amplitude iOS SDK Product Suite

The Amplitude iOS SDK ecosystem consists of multiple interconnected SDKs and tools designed to provide comprehensive analytics, experimentation, and user behavior tracking for iOS applications. The suite supports both Swift and Objective-C development and offers various installation methods including CocoaPods, Swift Package Manager, and Carthage.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

### Core SDK Evolution
The product suite represents an evolution from a maintenance-mode legacy SDK (Amplitude-iOS) to modern Swift-native implementations:

- **Legacy iOS SDK (Amplitude-iOS)**: Maintenance mode SDK supporting basic analytics functionality
- **iOS Swift SDK (Amplitude-Swift)**: Modern replacement with enhanced features, plugin architecture, and autocapture capabilities
- **Unified SDK (AmplitudeUnified)**: Beta wrapper that combines Analytics, Experiment, and Session Replay SDKs with synchronized identity management

### Ampli Code Generation Layer
The **Ampli wrapper** sits above the core SDKs, providing strongly-typed, code-generated event tracking methods based on Amplitude tracking plans. This ensures type safety and consistency across development teams.

### Specialized Components
- **Session Replay SDK**: iOS-only component for recording user interactions
- **Experiment SDK**: A/B testing and feature flag functionality
- **Analytics SDK**: Core event tracking and user analytics

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Core Concepts
- **Tracking Plan**: Schema definition for events and properties used to generate Ampli wrapper code
- **Autocapture**: Automatic tracking of sessions, app lifecycles, screen views, element interactions, and network requests
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible system for enrichment and destination plugins to customize data processing
- **Device ID**: Unique identifier using IDFA (Identifier for Advertisers) or IDFV (Identifier for Vendor)

### Configuration Objects
- **Configuration**: Primary initialization object for iOS Swift SDK
- **LoadOptions**: Ampli-specific configuration for environment and API key settings
- **AnalyticsConfig/ExperimentPlugin.Config/SessionReplayPlugin.Config**: Unified SDK component configurations

### Event Management
- **BaseEvent**: Foundation class for all trackable events in the modern SDK
- **AMPIdentify**: Legacy SDK class for user property management
- **AMPRevenue**: Revenue tracking implementation
- **EventOptions**: Per-event configuration including device ID and timestamp overrides

## API Endpoints and Integration Methods

### Core Tracking Methods
- **Modern SDK**: `amplitude.track()`, `amplitude.identify()`, `amplitude.revenue()`
- **Legacy SDK**: `logEvent()`, `setUserProperties()`, `logRevenue()`
- **Ampli**: `Ampli.instance.track()`, `Ampli.instance.identify()`, `Ampli.instance.load()`

### CLI Operations
- **ampli pull**: Downloads and generates strongly-typed tracking code from tracking plans
- **ampli status**: Verifies implementation against tracking plan requirements

### Session and User Management
- **Session Control**: `minTimeBetweenSessionsMillis` configuration, automatic session tracking
- **User Identity**: `setUserId()`, `setDeviceId()`, unified identity synchronization across SDKs
- **Group Analytics**: `setGroup()`, `groupIdentify()` for organizational user segmentation

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

### Data Infrastructure
- **HTTP v2 API**: Modern endpoint for event transmission with improved performance
- **Server Zones**: EU data residency support for compliance requirements
- **Batch Processing**: Configurable batching with `flushQueueSize` and `flushIntervalMillis`

### Privacy and Compliance
- **Apple Privacy Manifest**: NSPrivacyTracking compliance for App Store requirements
- **COPPA Control**: Children's privacy protection with `enableCoppaControl`
- **Tracking Options**: Granular privacy controls through `AMPTrackingOptions` and `trackingOptions`

### Platform Support
- **Multi-Platform**: iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, and visionOS compatibility
- **Framework Integration**: UIKit and SwiftUI support with specialized autocapture
- **App Extensions**: Support for App Clips, Today Extensions, and other iOS extension types

### Migration and Maintenance
The ecosystem includes comprehensive migration tooling from legacy implementations, with `migrateLegacyData` configuration options and detailed API mapping documentation. The plugin architecture enables custom storage providers and middleware integration for enterprise requirements.

The unified approach allows developers to implement analytics, experimentation, and session replay with synchronized user identity and streamlined configuration management across all Amplitude products.
