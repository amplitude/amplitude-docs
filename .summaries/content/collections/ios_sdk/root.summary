# Amplitude iOS SDK Product Suite

The Amplitude iOS SDK ecosystem is a comprehensive analytics, experimentation, and user behavior tracking platform designed specifically for iOS development. The suite encompasses multiple interconnected SDKs that have evolved from a legacy Objective-C foundation to a modern Swift-first architecture, culminating in a unified SDK that combines analytics, experimentation, and session replay capabilities.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The iOS SDK ecosystem follows a clear evolutionary architecture with three primary SDK generations:

**Legacy Foundation (Amplitude-iOS)**
The maintenance-mode Amplitude-iOS SDK serves as the foundational layer, built on Objective-C/Swift with instance-based initialization patterns and SQLite storage systems. This SDK established the core analytics functionality and API patterns that subsequent generations have refined.

**Modern Core (Amplitude-Swift)**
Amplitude-Swift represents the modern Swift-first evolution, introducing a plugin architecture that replaces the legacy middleware system. It features configuration-object initialization patterns, PersistentStorage systems replacing SQLite, and BaseEvent objects that modernize the event tracking paradigm beyond the legacy `logEvent()` method.

**Unified Platform (Amplitude Unified SDK)**
The beta Unified SDK serves as a comprehensive wrapper that integrates Analytics, Experiment, and Session Replay SDKs under a single initialization and identity management system. This represents the convergence of Amplitude's entire iOS product suite into a cohesive development experience.

**Development Toolchain (Ampli)**
The Ampli code generation tool creates strongly-typed event tracking methods from Amplitude tracking plans, providing compile-time safety and consistency across both legacy and modern SDK implementations.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Architecture Components**
- **BaseEvent**: Modern event tracking objects in Amplitude-Swift that replace legacy `logEvent()` method calls
- **Configuration**: Object-based initialization system that replaces instance-based SDK setup patterns
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible system supporting enrichment and destination plugins, superseding the legacy middleware approach
- **PersistentStorage**: Modern storage abstraction replacing direct SQLite implementation
- **AutocaptureOptions**: Automated tracking configuration covering sessions, app lifecycles, screen views, and element interactions

**Identity and User Management**
- **Identify**: User property management using `AMPIdentify` class (legacy) or `Identify` operations (modern)
- **setGroup/groupIdentifyWithGroupType**: Group analytics functionality enabling organizational user segmentation
- **IDFA/IDFV**: Apple identifier tracking implemented through plugin-based architecture
- **migrateLegacyData**: Automatic data migration capability from legacy SDK implementations

**Event and Revenue Tracking**
- **AMPRevenue**: Dedicated revenue tracking class for e-commerce analytics integration
- **EventOptions**: Per-event configuration including deviceId, price, and quantity parameters
- **TrackingOptions**: Privacy and compliance controls including COPPA compliance and selective data collection

**Performance and Transmission Controls**
- **flushQueueSize/flushIntervalMillis**: Batch processing controls governing event transmission timing
- **minTimeBetweenSessionsMillis**: Session boundary definition parameters
- **eventUploadThreshold/eventUploadPeriodSeconds**: Upload timing and batching configuration
- **NetworkConnectivityCheckerPlugin**: Offline mode support and network state management

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The iOS SDK suite integrates deeply with Amplitude's comprehensive analytics and experimentation platform through multiple integration points:

**Analytics Platform Integration**
The SDKs connect to Amplitude's analytics infrastructure via HTTP v2 API endpoints (upgraded from v1 in legacy implementations), supporting EU data residency through `setServerZone` configuration and real-time event tracking with robust offline mode capabilities.

**Experimentation Platform**
Integration with Amplitude's Experiment platform occurs through the Unified SDK, exposing methods like `amplitude.experiment.fetch()`, `variant()`, and `exposure()` for feature flag management and A/B testing. Remote configuration support is enabled through `enableAutoCaptureRemoteConfig` settings.

**Session Replay Capabilities**
The iOS-exclusive Session Replay SDK integration provides user session recording through `startRecording()` and `stopRecording()` controls, with configurable sampling rates via `sessionSampleRate` and `scrollSampleRate` parameters.

**Privacy and Compliance Framework**
The ecosystem addresses Apple's privacy requirements through Privacy Manifest compliance with `NSPrivacyTracking` declarations, COPPA compliance controls via TrackingOptions, and SSL pinning for secure data transmission.

## API Endpoints and Implementation Methods

**Package Management Integration**
- CocoaPods: `pod 'Amplitude'` (legacy), `pod 'AmplitudeSwift'` (modern), `pod 'AmplitudeUnified'` (unified)
- Swift Package Manager: Direct GitHub repository integration across all SDK variants
- Carthage: Binary framework distribution support

**Command Line Interface**
- Ampli CLI: `@amplitude/ampli` npm package for tracking plan code generation
- `ampli pull`: Downloads strongly-typed event definitions from tracking plans
- `ampli status`: Provides tracking plan verification and synchronization status

**Platform and Framework Support**
The ecosystem provides comprehensive coverage across iOS, tvOS, and watchOS platforms, with support for iOS Extensions and App Clips. Integration spans both UIKit and SwiftUI frameworks while maintaining Objective-C and Swift language interoperability.

The architecture enables developers to transition seamlessly from legacy implementations through modern Swift-first approaches to the unified platform, while maintaining backward compatibility and providing clear migration paths throughout the ecosystem evolution.
