## Amplitude iOS SDK Product Suite

The Amplitude iOS SDK ecosystem is a comprehensive analytics, experimentation, and user behavior tracking platform for iOS applications. It consists of multiple interconnected SDKs designed with a clear evolution path from legacy to modern architectures, providing developers with robust tools for understanding user engagement and optimizing app performance.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The iOS SDK ecosystem operates across three distinct architectural tiers:

**Core Analytics Layer:**
- **iOS SDK (Amplitude-iOS)** - Legacy maintenance-mode implementation using instance-based architecture with SQLite storage
- **iOS Swift SDK (Amplitude-Swift)** - Modern replacement featuring plugin architecture, configuration-object initialization, and PersistentStorage system
- **Unified SDK (AmplitudeUnified)** - Beta wrapper consolidating Analytics, Experiment, and Session Replay SDKs under unified identity management

**Code Generation Layer:**
- **Ampli for iOS Swift SDK** - Strongly-typed wrapper generating type-safe event tracking methods from Amplitude tracking plans, supporting both Swift and Objective-C implementations

**Migration Infrastructure:**
- Comprehensive migration utilities facilitating transitions from SQLite to PersistentStorage, API method updates (logEvent → track()), and architectural shifts from middleware to plugin systems

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Tracking APIs:**
- **track()** - Primary event logging method in modern SDK architecture
- **identify()** - User property management using AMPIdentify class for property operations
- **AMPRevenue** - Dedicated revenue tracking class for e-commerce analytics
- **setGroup/groupIdentify** - User segmentation and group property management system

**Configuration Architecture:**
- **Configuration object** - Modern initialization pattern replacing legacy instance() method calls
- **Plugin architecture** - Extensible system supporting enrichment and destination plugins via PluginType
- **PersistentStorage** - Modern storage implementation replacing SQLite backend
- **TrackingOptions** - Privacy and compliance controls for COPPA, IDFA, carrier, and location data

**Advanced Tracking Features:**
- **Autocapture** - Automatic tracking of sessions, app lifecycles, screen views, element interactions, and network requests
- **defaultTracking** - Legacy equivalent covering sessions, appLifecycles, screenViews, and deepLinks
- **Middleware/AMPMiddlewarePayload** - Legacy event processing system superseded by plugin architecture

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The iOS SDK suite integrates seamlessly with Amplitude's comprehensive analytics and experimentation platform:

**API Infrastructure:**
- Migration from HTTP v1 to v2 API endpoints for enhanced performance and reliability
- EU data residency support through setServerZone configuration
- Remote configuration capabilities via enableAutoCaptureRemoteConfig

**Cross-Platform Consistency:**
- Ampli CLI tool (@amplitude/ampli npm package) enabling cross-platform tracking plan code generation
- Unified event schema and user property management across platforms
- Consolidated identity management system in the beta Unified SDK

**Privacy and Compliance Framework:**
- Apple privacy manifest integration (NSPrivacyTracking, NSPrivacyCollectedDataTypes)
- IDFA/IDFV plugin implementation for device identification
- SSL pinning and comprehensive tracking controls for regulatory compliance

## Installation and Implementation Methods

**Package Management Support:**
- CocoaPods integration via AmplitudeSwift pod
- Swift Package Manager support for Amplitude-Swift package
- Carthage compatibility for legacy workflows

**CLI Operations:**
- `ampli pull` command for tracking plan synchronization
- `ampli status` verification for implementation validation
- Configuration management through LoadOptions and EventOptions

**Platform Compatibility:**
- iOS, tvOS, watchOS support
- iOS extensions and App Clips compatibility
- UIKit and SwiftUI framework integration
- Swift and Objective-C language support

The ecosystem delivers a complete analytics solution with structured upgrade paths, extensive customization capabilities, and robust privacy controls while maintaining backward compatibility throughout the transition from legacy to modern implementations.
