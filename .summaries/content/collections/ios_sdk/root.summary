# Amplitude iOS SDK Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude's iOS SDK is a comprehensive analytics solution for iOS applications, enabling developers to track user behavior, manage user properties, and analyze app performance. The product consists of two main SDK versions:

1. **Amplitude-Swift (iOS Swift SDK)** - The newer, recommended SDK built with Swift, featuring a plugin architecture and modern Swift-based API
2. **Amplitude-iOS (Maintenance iOS SDK)** - The legacy SDK that is still maintained but not receiving new features

Both SDKs support core analytics functionality including event tracking, user identification, session management, and revenue tracking, with the Swift SDK offering enhanced features like autocapture and a more flexible plugin system.

## Product Relationships and Features

### Core SDK Components

1. **Amplitude-Swift (iOS Swift SDK)**
   - Built natively in Swift with Objective-C compatibility
   - Plugin-based architecture for extensibility
   - Strongly-typed event tracking via Ampli wrapper
   - Autocapture capabilities for automatic event collection
   - Modern configuration approach using a configuration object

2. **Amplitude-iOS (Maintenance iOS SDK)**
   - Legacy SDK with traditional callback-based architecture
   - Supports both Swift and Objective-C
   - Continues to receive bug fixes but no new features

3. **Ampli Wrapper**
   - Code-generated tracking library that provides type-safety
   - Integrates with the iOS Swift SDK
   - Enables validation of event tracking implementation

### Feature Relationships

- **Event Tracking**: Both SDKs support the core `track` method, with the Swift SDK offering a more streamlined API
- **User Identification**: Both support `identify` for user property management, with the Swift SDK using a more consistent approach
- **Session Management**: Both provide automatic and manual session tracking capabilities
- **Revenue Tracking**: Both support revenue event tracking with the Swift SDK using a more structured approach
- **Plugins**: The Swift SDK introduces a plugin architecture that allows for customization and extension

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **AmplitudeSwift**: The main class for the iOS Swift SDK that handles initialization and provides access to tracking methods
- **Amplitude**: The main class for the legacy iOS SDK
- **Identify**: An operation to set or modify user properties
- **Track**: The method used to record events
- **Event**: A user action or occurrence that is tracked
- **User Properties**: Attributes associated with a user
- **Device ID**: A unique identifier for the device
- **User ID**: A unique identifier for the user
- **Session**: A period of user engagement with the app
- **Plugin**: In the Swift SDK, a component that can intercept and modify events or add functionality
- **Middleware**: In the legacy SDK, a component that can intercept and modify events
- **Ampli**: The strongly-typed wrapper for event tracking
- **LoadOptions**: Configuration options for the Ampli wrapper
- **EventOptions**: Options that can be passed when tracking an event

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The iOS SDKs integrate with the broader Amplitude ecosystem:

1. **Amplitude Analytics Platform**: Events tracked via the SDKs are sent to Amplitude's analytics platform for analysis
2. **Ampli CLI**: Command-line tool that generates the strongly-typed Ampli wrapper based on your tracking plan
3. **EU Data Residency**: Both SDKs support sending data to EU servers for compliance with European regulations
4. **Privacy Controls**: Both SDKs include features for COPPA compliance and privacy manifest support

## API Endpoints and Commands

### Swift SDK Core Methods

```swift
// Initialization
let amplitude = AmplitudeSwift(
    configuration: Configuration(
        apiKey: "YOUR-API-KEY"
    )
)

// Event Tracking
amplitude.track(
    eventType: "Button Clicked",
    eventProperties: ["buttonColor": "red"]
)

// User Identification
amplitude.identify(
    Identify()
        .set("email", value: "user@example.com")
        .set("role", value: "admin")
)

// Flush Events
amplitude.flush()
```

### Ampli CLI Commands

```bash
# Pull tracking plan
ampli pull

# Check implementation status
ampli status
```

### Ampli Wrapper Usage

```swift
// Initialize Ampli
let ampli = Ampli()
ampli.load(LoadOptions(client: AmplitudeSwift(configuration: Configuration(apiKey: "YOUR-API-KEY"))))

// Track strongly-typed event
ampli.songPlayed(name: "Song Name", duration: 240)
```

### Legacy SDK Core Methods

```swift
// Initialization
Amplitude.instance().initializeApiKey("YOUR-API-KEY")

// Event Tracking
Amplitude.instance().logEvent("Button Clicked", withEventProperties: ["buttonColor": "red"])

// User Identification
let identify = AMPIdentify()
identify.set("email", value: "user@example.com")
Amplitude.instance().identify(identify)
```

Both SDKs support installation via CocoaPods, Swift Package Manager, and Carthage, with detailed implementation guides available for each approach.
