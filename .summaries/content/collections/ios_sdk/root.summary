# Amplitude iOS SDK Product Overview

## High-Level Overview

The Amplitude iOS SDK is an analytics solution for iOS applications that enables developers to track user behavior, events, and properties. Available in two versions: a modern Swift-based SDK (AmplitudeSwift) and a maintenance Objective-C-based SDK (Amplitude-iOS). The SDK provides comprehensive event tracking, user identification, revenue monitoring, session management, and advanced features including middleware, plugins, and privacy controls.

Key features include event tracking with custom properties, user identification and property management, revenue tracking for in-app purchases, configurable session management, autocapture capabilities, plugin architecture for extensibility, privacy controls (COPPA compliance, EU data residency), offline event queuing, and strongly-typed event tracking through the Ampli wrapper.

## Product Relationships

The Amplitude iOS SDK ecosystem consists of three main components:

1. **iOS Swift SDK (AmplitudeSwift)**: The newer implementation built with Swift, featuring a plugin architecture and modern Swift capabilities. This is the recommended SDK for new implementations.

2. **Maintenance iOS SDK (Amplitude-iOS)**: The legacy Objective-C implementation that continues to be maintained but receives no new features.

3. **Ampli Wrapper**: A code-generated layer that provides strongly-typed event tracking based on your defined tracking plan, ensuring type safety and consistency.

The SDK can be integrated through multiple dependency managers:
- CocoaPods: `pod 'AmplitudeSwift'` or `pod 'Amplitude'` (legacy)
- Swift Package Manager: Using the URL `https://github.com/amplitude/Amplitude-Swift`
- Carthage: By adding `github "amplitude/Amplitude-Swift"` to your Cartfile

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: A tracked user action or occurrence within the application
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes associated with a specific user
- **Device ID**: Automatically generated unique identifier for the device
- **User ID**: Custom identifier assigned to users, typically after authentication
- **Session**: Period of user engagement, defined by configurable timeout settings
- **Identify**: Operations that modify user properties without generating events
- **Track**: Operations that record events with optional properties
- **Middleware**: Processing layer for events before transmission to Amplitude
- **Plugin**: Modular components extending SDK functionality
- **Flush**: Process of sending queued events to Amplitude servers
- **LoadOptions**: Configuration options used during SDK initialization
- **EventOptions**: Configuration options applied to individual event tracking
- **DefaultTrackingOptions**: Settings for automatic event tracking features

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The iOS SDK integrates with the broader Amplitude platform:

1. **Amplitude Dashboard**: All tracked events appear in the Amplitude analytics dashboard for analysis
2. **Data Taxonomy**: Compatible with Amplitude's tracking plan and data taxonomy features
3. **Ampli CLI**: Works with the command-line tool for generating type-safe event tracking code
4. **Experiment**: Can integrate with Amplitude Experiment for A/B testing functionality
5. **EU Data Residency**: Supports EU server endpoints for regulatory compliance

## API Usage Examples

### SDK Initialization
```swift
import AmplitudeSwift

let amplitude = Amplitude(
    configuration: Configuration(
        apiKey: "YOUR-API-KEY",
        defaultTracking: DefaultTrackingOptions(
            sessions: true,
            appLifecycles: true,
            screenViews: true,
            deepLinks: true
        )
    )
)
```

### Event Tracking
```swift
// Basic event
amplitude.track(eventType: "Button Clicked")

// Event with properties
amplitude.track(
    eventType: "Product Purchased",
    eventProperties: ["price": 10.99, "product_id": "abc123"]
)
```

### User Identification
```swift
// Set user ID
amplitude.setUserId(userId: "user@example.com")

// Set user properties
amplitude.identify(
    Identify()
        .set("premium", value: true)
        .set("plan_type", value: "annual")
)
```

### Revenue Tracking
```swift
let revenue = Revenue()
revenue.setProductId("com.company.app.productId")
revenue.setPrice(3.99)
revenue.setQuantity(3)
amplitude.revenue(revenue)
```

### Group Identification
```swift
amplitude.setGroup(groupType: "org", groupName: "engineering")
```

### Ampli CLI Commands
```bash
# Pull tracking plan
ampli pull

# Check status
ampli status
```
