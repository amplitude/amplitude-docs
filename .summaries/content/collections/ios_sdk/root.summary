# Amplitude iOS SDK Product Suite

The Amplitude iOS SDK ecosystem is a comprehensive analytics, experimentation, and user behavior tracking platform designed specifically for iOS applications. The suite encompasses multiple SDKs ranging from legacy maintenance solutions to modern Swift-based architectures, supporting both Swift and Objective-C development environments with extensive privacy compliance and cross-product integration capabilities.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The iOS SDK ecosystem operates through a three-tiered hierarchical structure designed for progressive adoption and feature expansion:

**Foundation Layer:**
- **iOS SDK (Amplitude-iOS)** - Legacy maintenance mode SDK providing core analytics functionality with established stability
- **iOS Swift SDK (Amplitude-Swift)** - Modern replacement featuring enhanced plugin architecture, improved performance, and native Swift implementation

**Integration Layer:**
- **Unified SDK (AmplitudeUnified)** - Beta wrapper providing seamless integration across Analytics, Experiment, and Session Replay SDKs with synchronized user identity management

**Development Tools Layer:**
- **Ampli Wrapper** - Code generation framework creating strongly-typed event tracking methods derived from Amplitude tracking plans
- **Analytics SDK** - Specialized component for event tracking and user analytics
- **Experiment SDK** - A/B testing and feature flag management system
- **Session Replay SDK** - iOS-exclusive user session recording and playback capabilities

The architectural migration path flows from legacy iOS SDK → Swift SDK → Unified SDK, enabling organizations to adopt modern capabilities while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Analytics Concepts:**
- **Tracking Plans** - Structured schemas defining standardized events and properties for consistent data governance
- **Autocapture** - Automated collection system for standard events including sessions, app lifecycles, screen views, element interactions, and network requests
- **Plugins** - Modular architecture components enabling custom enrichment and destination routing
- **Device ID Types** - IDFA (Identifier for Advertisers) and IDFV (Identifier for Vendor) for cross-session user identification
- **User Properties** - Persistent user-level attributes managed through the identify API
- **Event Properties** - Contextual metadata attached to individual events
- **Revenue Tracking** - Specialized event classification for monetary transaction recording

**Configuration Architecture:**
- **Configuration** - Primary initialization object replacing instance-based configuration patterns
- **TrackingOptions** - Granular controls for disabling specific automatic data collection fields
- **LoadOptions** - Ampli-specific initialization configuration for wrapper deployment
- **EventOptions** - Per-event configuration including deviceId, price, quantity, and custom routing

**Primary API Methods:**
- **track()** - Core event logging method (supersedes legacy logEvent)
- **identify()** - User property assignment and management
- **setGroup()/groupIdentify()** - User group assignment with group-level property management
- **flush()** - Immediate event upload trigger bypassing batching
- **setUserId()/setDeviceId()** - User identification lifecycle management

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The iOS SDK suite functions as a critical component within Amplitude's comprehensive analytics and experimentation platform through multiple integration vectors:

**Data Pipeline Architecture:**
- Events route through Amplitude's HTTP v2 API endpoint with automatic batching and retry logic
- EU data residency compliance via serverZone configuration for GDPR requirements
- Dynamic configuration system enabling server-side settings management without app updates

**Cross-Product Identity Synchronization:**
- Unified SDK maintains synchronized user properties across Analytics, Experiment, and Session Replay products
- Consistent user identification propagation across all Amplitude product touchpoints
- Group-based analytics enabling account-level insights and B2B use case support

**Privacy and Compliance Framework:**
- Apple Privacy Manifest compliance with NSPrivacyTracking and NSPrivacyCollectedDataTypes declarations
- COPPA compliance controls for applications serving users under 13
- Comprehensive opt-out mechanisms and tracking disable capabilities
- SSL certificate pinning support for enhanced data transmission security

## Installation and Implementation

**Package Manager Support:**
All SDKs provide installation through CocoaPods, Swift Package Manager (SPM), and Carthage:
- `AmplitudeSwift` - Modern iOS Swift SDK package identifier
- `AmplitudeUnified` - Unified SDK package identifier
- `Amplitude-iOS` - Legacy maintenance mode SDK identifier

**Command Line Interface:**
- `@amplitude/ampli` npm package provides CLI tooling for code generation workflows
- `ampli pull` - Generates strongly-typed tracking methods from server-side tracking plans
- `ampli status` - Validates implementation compliance against defined tracking plans

**Core API Endpoints and Invocations:**
- `amplitude.track(event)` - Primary event tracking with automatic property enrichment
- `amplitude.identify(identify)` - User property management with merge and overwrite capabilities
- `amplitude.experiment.fetch()` - Feature flag and experiment variant retrieval
- `amplitude.sessionReplay.startRecording()` - Session recording initiation with privacy controls
- `ampli.songPlayed()` - Example generated strongly-typed event method from tracking plans

The ecosystem supports advanced operational features including offline mode with intelligent retry mechanisms, configurable session management with custom timeout controls, middleware architecture for custom data processing pipelines, and comprehensive debugging through configurable log levels ranging from ERROR to VERBOSE.
