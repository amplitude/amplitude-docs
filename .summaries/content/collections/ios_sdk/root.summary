## Amplitude iOS SDK Product Suite

The Amplitude iOS SDK ecosystem is a comprehensive analytics, experimentation, and user behavior tracking platform designed for iOS applications. The suite supports Swift and Objective-C development across iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, and visionOS platforms, providing developers with flexible implementation options ranging from simple event tracking to complex multi-product analytics solutions.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

### SDK Evolution and Hierarchy
The product suite demonstrates a clear evolutionary path from legacy to modern implementations:

**Legacy iOS SDK (Amplitude-iOS)** serves as the foundation in maintenance mode, utilizing instance-based initialization with `logEvent` methods. This transitions to the **iOS Swift SDK (Amplitude-Swift)**, which represents the current production standard featuring configuration-based initialization, plugin architecture, and modern `track` methods.

At the apex sits the **Unified SDK (AmplitudeUnified)** in beta, which consolidates Analytics, Experiment, and Session Replay capabilities into a single wrapper. The **Ampli code generation layer** overlays the entire system, providing strongly-typed event tracking through code generation from Amplitude tracking plans.

### Integration Architecture
```
Ampli Wrapper (Type-safe code generation)
    ↓
Unified SDK (Beta - Multi-product wrapper)
    ↓
Core SDKs: Analytics + Experiment + Session Replay
    ↓
Platform Integration (CocoaPods/SPM/Carthage)
```

The Ampli wrapper generates type-safe event classes and methods that wrap underlying SDK calls, ensuring compile-time validation of analytics implementation and reducing runtime errors.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Core Analytics Concepts
- **Amplitude Instance**: The primary SDK client object responsible for event tracking and configuration management
- **Configuration Object**: Initialization parameters encompassing API keys, server zones, and feature flags
- **Event Tracking**: Primary analytics functionality using `track()` methods with BaseEvent objects
- **User Identification**: Identity management system through `identify()` API with user properties
- **Device ID**: Unique device identifiers leveraging IDFA/IDFV or custom implementations

### Advanced Feature Set
- **Autocapture**: Automated tracking system for sessions, app lifecycles, screen views, element interactions, and network requests
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible framework supporting enrichment and destination plugins for data processing
- **Revenue Tracking**: Specialized analytics for purchase events and revenue attribution
- **User Groups**: Segmentation functionality through `groupIdentify` APIs for cohort analysis
- **Session Management**: Configurable session tracking with `minTimeBetweenSessionsMillis` parameters

### Privacy and Compliance Framework
- **Tracking Options**: Granular data collection controls through `trackingOptions` configuration
- **COPPA Control**: Children's privacy compliance features for regulatory adherence
- **Apple Privacy Manifest**: Required privacy declarations for App Store compliance
- **Opt-out Controls**: User privacy management through `setOptOut` functionality

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

### Cross-Platform Analytics Strategy
The iOS SDKs integrate seamlessly with Amplitude's multi-platform analytics ecosystem, ensuring consistent tracking across web, Android, and server-side implementations. Unified identity management enables comprehensive user journey tracking across all touchpoints.

### Amplitude Cloud Services Integration
- **HTTP v2 API**: Modern event ingestion endpoint optimized for performance and reliability
- **EU Data Residency**: `setServerZone` configuration supporting GDPR compliance requirements
- **Tracking Plans**: Schema validation and code generation through Ampli CLI integration
- **Real-time Analytics**: Direct integration with Amplitude's event processing and dashboard systems

### Development Workflow Integration
The platform supports comprehensive development workflows through multiple package managers (CocoaPods, Swift Package Manager, Carthage), development tools for status verification and debugging, and migration assistance for SDK transitions.

## API Endpoints and Command Line Interface

### Ampli CLI Commands
- `ampli pull`: Downloads tracking plans and generates type-safe event classes from schema definitions
- `ampli status`: Validates implementation against tracking plan schema for compliance verification

### Core SDK API Methods
- **Initialization**: `Amplitude(configuration: Configuration)` for SDK setup
- **Event Tracking**: `amplitude.track(event: BaseEvent)` for analytics data collection
- **User Identification**: `amplitude.identify(identify: Identify)` for user property management
- **Revenue Tracking**: `amplitude.revenue(revenue: Revenue)` for monetization analytics
- **Session Management**: `amplitude.setSessionId(sessionId: Int64)` for session control
- **Data Transmission**: `amplitude.flush()` for immediate event upload and processing

### Configuration Parameters
Performance optimization is achieved through batching controls (`flushQueueSize`, `flushIntervalMillis`), session boundary definition (`minTimeBetweenSessionsMillis`), custom storage providers for persistent data management, and offline mode detection with connectivity handling.

The iOS SDK suite delivers enterprise-grade analytics capabilities with type safety, privacy compliance, and cross-platform consistency, scaling from simple implementations to sophisticated multi-product analytics architectures.
