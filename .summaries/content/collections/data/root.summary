Amplitude Data is a comprehensive data governance and management platform that serves as the central orchestration layer for analytics instrumentation across the entire data lifecycle. The platform functions as a centralized data catalog enabling organizations to create structured tracking plans, generate type-safe code, monitor data quality, and transform data retroactively while maintaining strict governance controls.

## Core Product Architecture

Amplitude Data operates as the governance backbone for Amplitude's analytics ecosystem, integrating seamlessly with multiple components in a hub-and-spoke architecture:

**Analytics Layer Integration**: Directly manages event schemas and metadata for Amplitude Analytics, controlling data visibility, validation rules, and access permissions across charts, cohorts, dashboards, and notebooks.

**SDK Ecosystem**: Supports both client-side implementations (Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Unity, Flutter) and server-side implementations (Node.js, Python, Java, Go) through centralized schema management and code generation.

**Developer Toolchain**: The Ampli Developer Tools generate type-safe tracking libraries from Data schemas, creating a seamless bridge between business requirements and technical implementation.

**External Integrations**: Comprehensive source catalog for data ingestion and destination catalog for real-time event streaming to third-party platforms with p95 latency targets of 60 seconds.

The platform employs a Git-like branch-based workflow where users create feature branches for schema modifications, collaborate through team review processes, and merge approved changes to main branches with automatic versioning of tracking plans.

## Feature Relationships and Data Flow

### Schema Management and Planning
The platform's tracking plan functionality serves as the foundational layer, defining events, event properties, user properties, and group properties in a hierarchical structure. Property groups enable bulk management across multiple events, while derived properties allow retroactive calculations using formulas applied to existing data. Lookup tables provide data enrichment capabilities through CSV mapping, creating a comprehensive data modeling environment.

### Code Generation and Implementation
Ampli CLI tools (`ampli pull`, `ampli status --is-merged`) create a direct pipeline from schema definitions to implementation code, generating type-safe wrappers that provide autocompletion, compile-time validation, and runtime checks. This ensures instrumentation accuracy and prevents common implementation errors through automated code generation.

### Data Quality and Observability
The Observe feature creates a continuous monitoring loop, automatically validating event streams against tracking plan definitions and categorizing events as Valid, Invalid, Unexpected, or Out of Date. The Event Explorer Chrome extension provides real-time validation during development and testing phases.

### Transformation and Data Management
Transformations operate at query time, enabling retroactive data structure modifications without affecting raw data integrity. Users can merge events and properties, rename values, hide sensitive information, and create custom events using OR clause combinations across multiple existing events.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Core Data Objects
**Events**: Discrete user actions tracked within applications, representing behavioral touchpoints in the user journey.

**Event Properties**: Contextual attributes captured at the moment events occur, providing situational data for analysis.

**User Properties**: Persistent user attributes that maintain state across sessions, including device characteristics, demographic information, and User ID mappings.

**Group Properties**: Account-level attributes designed for B2B analytics scenarios, requiring the Accounts add-on for full functionality.

**Sources**: SDK configuration definitions that specify data collection parameters and validation rules.

**Tracking Plan**: Comprehensive schema documentation defining the complete event taxonomy and property specifications for a project.

### Advanced Data Constructs
**Property Groups**: Reusable collections of event properties that can be applied across multiple events for consistency and efficiency.

**Derived Properties**: Calculated fields created through formula applications to existing properties, enabling retroactive data enrichment.

**Lookup Properties**: Enhanced properties created through CSV data mapping for external data integration.

**Custom Events**: Composite events created using OR logic across multiple existing events for simplified analysis.

**Transformed Events/Properties**: Retroactively modified data structures that change presentation without altering source data.

### Quality and Governance
**Schema Violations**: Deviations from defined tracking plans, including unplanned events, properties, or property values.

**Block Filters**: Ingestion-time data filtering mechanisms that prevent unwanted data from entering the system.

**Drop Filters**: Query-time filtering for analysis exclusion without affecting data storage.

**Data Access Control (DAC)**: Enterprise-grade feature for managing granular access to sensitive data elements.

### Workflow Management
**Branches**: Feature-based development environments for schema changes following Git-like patterns.

**Merge Requests**: Collaborative review processes for approving and implementing schema modifications.

**Pending Changes**: Staged modifications awaiting publication to live tracking plans.

**Versioned Tracking Plans**: Published schema versions with automatic numbering and change tracking.
