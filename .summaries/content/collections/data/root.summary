Amplitude Data is a comprehensive data governance and management platform that serves as the centralized control layer for analytics instrumentation across web and mobile applications. The platform enables organizations to create structured tracking plans, generate type-safe code, and monitor data quality in real-time through a collaborative, version-controlled environment.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform operates through several interconnected components that form a complete data governance ecosystem:

**Tracking Plans** function as the foundational schema definition system, enabling teams to define events, event properties, user properties, and group properties in structured formats. These plans support Git-like branching workflows with collaborative features including merge requests, team reviews, and environment-specific deployments.

**Ampli Developer Tools** generate type-safe, auto-generated tracking libraries directly from tracking plans, providing compile-time validation and IDE autocompletion. The Ampli CLI integrates seamlessly into development workflows with commands like `ampli pull` and `ampli status --is-merged` to ensure instrumentation consistency across teams.

**Data Ingestion and Validation** operates through multiple pathways including client-side SDKs (Browser, Android, iOS, Unity, Flutter, React Native), server-side SDKs (Node.js, Go, Python, Java), and third-party integrations. The platform supports both HTTP V2 API and Batch Event Upload API endpoints for different ingestion patterns and volume requirements.

## Key Features and Capabilities

**Schema Management** provides granular control over data structure through configurable schema violation handling. Organizations can configure responses to three violation types - unplanned event types, unplanned properties, and unplanned property values - choosing to either "Mark As Unexpected" or "Reject" violations based on governance requirements.

**Data Transformation and Enhancement** includes several powerful retroactive capabilities:
- **Derived Properties** enable property creation using formulas with functions like REGEXEXTRACT, SPLIT, CONCAT, and DATE_TIME_FORMATTER
- **Custom Events** combine multiple existing events with OR clauses for flexible analysis scenarios
- **Lookup Tables** enrich incoming data by mapping CSV imports (supporting up to 100MB/1M rows) to existing properties
- **Transformations** allow retroactive data structure modifications including event merging, property renaming, and value hiding

**Real-time Monitoring and Observability** through the Observe feature automatically validates incoming events against tracking plans, categorizing them as Unexpected, Valid, Invalid, or Out of Date. The system provides source attribution, property type validation, and environment-specific filtering for comprehensive data quality monitoring.

## Data Access and Security Framework

**Data Access Control (DAC)** enables Enterprise organizations to classify properties as PII, revenue, or sensitive data with group-based permissions through the Groups framework. These restrictions apply comprehensively across charts, cohorts, dashboards, exports, and the Taxonomy API, ensuring consistent data protection.

**Data Mutability** supports INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations through Mirror Sync strategies across major cloud data warehouses including Snowflake (CDC), Databricks (CDF), and Amazon S3 integrations. This capability enables compliance with GDPR and CCPA requirements through comprehensive data lifecycle management.

## Integration Ecosystem

**Source Integrations** encompass native SDKs, third-party platforms (Segment, mParticle, Tealium), cloud storage imports (Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage), and specialized plugins for WordPress and Shopify that provide advanced autocapture capabilities for e-commerce and content management scenarios.

**Destination Streaming** enables real-time behavioral data forwarding to downstream tools with 60-second p95 latency targets, exponential backoff retry mechanisms, and configuration-based filtering. The platform supports streaming of transformed events including Custom Events, Derived Properties, and Transformed Properties.

**Cohort Synchronization** provides three sync cadences: one-time, scheduled (hourly/daily), and real-time (every minute) to third-party destinations including ad networks and marketing automation platforms for audience activation use cases.

## Advanced Analytics Features

**Cross-Project Analysis** through portfolios combines up to 5 source projects with schema ranking for conflict resolution, enabling enterprise-wide analytics across organizational boundaries. **Currency Conversion** provides multi-currency revenue analysis using ISO 4217 currency codes and ExchangeRate API integration for global business intelligence.

**Channels** create retroactive property classifiers based on UTM and referrer data for acquisition tracking, while **Autocapture** automatically captures user interactions (clicks, page views, sessions, form interactions) across Browser SDK, iOS Swift SDK, and Android-Kotlin SDK with visual labeling capabilities and privacy protections for sensitive elements.

## API and Developer Tools

The **Taxonomy API** enables programmatic CRUD operations for categories, event types, event properties, and user properties, supporting automated governance workflows. The **Chrome Extension Debugger** provides real-time instrumentation debugging with event parameter viewing and SDK configuration access for development teams.

**Time-to-Live (TTL)** configuration manages data retention at organization and project levels with daily deletion jobs for compliance and cost management. **CSV Import/Export** functionality supports bulk tracking plan management with detailed field schemas and branching workflows for large-scale governance operations.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Tracking Plans**: Schema definitions that specify the structure and validation rules for analytics events
- **Ampli**: Type-safe code generation tool and CLI for implementing tracking plans
- **Schema Violations**: Events or properties that don't conform to the defined tracking plan structure
- **Derived Properties**: Retroactively created properties using formula-based transformations
- **Mirror Sync**: Data warehouse synchronization strategy supporting INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations
- **Observe**: Real-time data quality monitoring and validation system
- **Portfolios**: Cross-project analysis framework combining multiple data sources
- **Autocapture**: Automatic event tracking for common user interactions without manual instrumentation

## Broader Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Data functions as the governance foundation for the broader Amplitude Analytics platform, providing the data quality and structure necessary for reliable behavioral analytics. The platform integrates with development workflows through Git-like versioning, Jira integration for automatic issue creation, and CI/CD pipeline integration through the Ampli CLI. This positions Amplitude Data as both a standalone data governance solution and the critical infrastructure layer enabling enterprise-scale behavioral analytics across the Amplitude ecosystem.
