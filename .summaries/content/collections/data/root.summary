Amplitude Data is a comprehensive data governance and catalog management platform that serves as the central hub for planning, implementing, and managing analytics instrumentation across organizations. The platform provides end-to-end tools for defining data taxonomy, creating tracking plans, and ensuring data quality throughout the analytics lifecycle.

## Core Product Architecture

Amplitude Data operates as a governance layer positioned between data collection and analytics, providing both planning and management capabilities. The platform integrates deeply with Amplitude Analytics projects and supports cross-project analysis through portfolios that can combine up to 5 source projects with schema ranking for conflict resolution.

The system implements a Git-like branching model where users create feature branches from main to make tracking plan changes, publish those changes to create versioned tracking plans, and merge branches back to main after team review approvals. This workflow enables collaborative development with stakeholder reviews and testing environment integration.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

**Data Planning Layer:**
- Tracking plans serve as the foundational schema definition, containing events, event properties, user properties, and group properties
- Ampli Developer Tools generate type-safe, autogenerated tracking libraries from tracking plans
- Visual Labeling provides no-code event creation through DOM element selection
- Property Groups enable bulk application of event properties across multiple events

**Data Processing and Enhancement:**
- Custom Events combine multiple existing events using OR clauses
- Derived Properties create new properties retroactively using formulas and functions
- Transformations enable retroactive data structure modifications at query time
- Lookup Tables enrich properties by mapping CSV data sources
- Channels provide retroactive property classification based on UTM and referrer data

**Quality Assurance and Observability:**
- Observe feature validates event streams against tracking plans automatically
- Schema violation handling provides options to mark data as unexpected or reject it entirely
- AI Data Assistant delivers automated tracking plan optimization suggestions
- Chrome Extension (Amplitude Instrumentation Explorer) enables real-time debugging

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Data Entities:**
- **Events**: User actions or occurrences tracked in the system (e.g., "Button Clicked", "Purchase Completed")
- **Event Properties**: Attributes specific to individual events at the time they occurred
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes of individual users across sessions (device type, location, User ID)
- **Group Properties**: Properties associated with account-level entities (requires Accounts add-on)

**Organizational Structures:**
- **Sources**: SDK or integration configurations within tracking plans
- **Tracking Plan**: Complete schema definition including all events, properties, and their relationships
- **Branches**: Feature development environments for making tracking plan changes
- **Portfolios**: Cross-project analysis containers combining multiple source projects

**Data Processing Concepts:**
- **Autocapture**: Automatic capture of user interactions with minimal setup
- **Schema Violations**: Occurrences of unplanned event types, properties, or property values
- **Transformations**: Retroactive modifications applied at query time
- **Derived Properties**: New properties created using formulas on existing properties
- **Drop Filters**: Query-time filtering mechanisms
- **Block Filters**: Ingestion-time data blocking mechanisms

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

**Amplitude Platform Integration:**
The platform serves as the data foundation for Amplitude Analytics, with tracking plans directly feeding into analytics projects. Portfolios enable cross-project analysis by combining multiple source projects with intelligent schema conflict resolution.

**SDK and Development Integration:**
- Client-side SDKs: Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Unity, Flutter
- Server-side SDKs: Node.js, Go, Python, Java
- Development workflow integration through Jira for automatic issue creation on branch changes

**Third-Party Platform Integrations:**
- E-commerce: Shopify Plugin with automatic event tracking and Session Replay
- Content Management: WordPress Plugin with advanced Autocapture functionality
- Data Warehouses: Snowflake, Databricks, Amazon S3 for Profiles and data mutability
- Real-time data forwarding through destination event streaming

**Enterprise Governance:**
- Data Access Control (DAC) for Enterprise organizations with property classification (PII, revenue, sensitive)
- Role-based permissions (Admin/Manager/Member/Viewer) with group-based access controls
- Time-to-Live (TTL) configuration for event data retention
- Object Management for centralized control of reusable analysis objects

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Core APIs:**
- **Taxonomy API**: CRUD operations for categories, event types, event properties, and user properties
- **HTTP V2 API**: Real-time event ingestion
- **Batch Event Upload API**: Historical data import with ingestion limits (500K events per device ID daily)
- **User Privacy API**: Data deletion for GDPR/CCPA compliance
- **Evaluation API**: For feature flag and experimentation integration

**Command Line Tools:**
- **Ampli CLI**: Code generation and tracking plan synchronization
  - `ampli pull`: Download tracking plan and generate code
  - `ampli status --is-merged`: Check branch merge status

**Data Flow Mechanisms:**
- Destination event streaming for real-time behavioral data forwarding
- Cohort synchronization with third-party destinations (one-time, scheduled, real-time)
- Streaming transformations for forwarding pre-existing transformed events and properties
- Mirror Sync strategies for warehouse integrations with data mutability support

**Configuration and Automation:**
- Schema settings for violation handling (unexpected vs reject)
- Autocapture configuration with CSS selector allowlists
- Currency conversion using ISO 4217 currency codes and ExchangeRate API integration
- AI-powered automation through the Data Assistant for tracking plan optimization

The platform enforces data quality through comprehensive validation, supports enterprise-grade governance with access controls and retention policies, and provides extensive automation capabilities for both technical and non-technical users through visual interfaces and AI-powered suggestions.
