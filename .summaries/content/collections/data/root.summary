# Amplitude Data: Comprehensive Data Governance Platform

## Product Overview

Amplitude Data is a data governance platform that centralizes the management of analytics data across an organization. It enables teams to define, track, verify, and improve data quality through a structured approach to data collection and management. The platform serves as the foundation for reliable analytics by ensuring consistent implementation of tracking across products and teams.

Key features include data planning and instrumentation, data management capabilities, real-time validation against defined plans, and the ability to transform event data retroactively without code changes.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

Amplitude Data functions as the foundation of the Amplitude product ecosystem:

- **Amplitude Analytics**: Consumes the structured data from Amplitude Data to power user behavior analysis, funnel tracking, and other analytics functions
- **Amplitude SDKs**: Implement tracking plans defined in Amplitude Data across platforms (Browser, iOS Swift, Android-Kotlin)
- **Ampli Developer Tools**: Generate type-safe code based on tracking plans defined in Amplitude Data
- **Destination Integrations**: Enable streaming of event data to third-party platforms
- **Session Replay**: Complements event data with visual recordings of user sessions

External integrations extend functionality:
- E-commerce and CMS platforms (Shopify, WordPress)
- Development workflow tools (Jira)
- Data warehouses (Snowflake, Databricks, S3) for profile data integration

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Data Collection Concepts
- **Events**: Discrete user actions or system occurrences tracked in the platform
- **Event Properties**: Contextual attributes specific to an event occurrence
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes associated with users across sessions
- **Group Properties**: Attributes for organizational groupings of users
- **Autocapture**: Automatic collection of standard events without manual instrumentation
- **Visual Labeling**: Non-technical interface for defining events through UI interaction

### Data Management Concepts
- **Tracking Plan**: Specification document defining the expected structure of events and properties
- **Property Groups**: Reusable collections of properties applicable to multiple events
- **Custom Events**: Logical combinations of multiple events using OR operators
- **Derived Properties**: Retroactively created properties using formulas applied to existing data
- **Lookup Tables**: Data enrichment through mappings imported from CSV files
- **Transformations**: Query-time modifications that preserve raw data integrity
- **Channels**: Classification system for traffic sources based on UTM parameters and referrers

### Data Governance Concepts
- **Schema Violations**: Deviations from defined tracking plans
- **Data Access Control (DAC)**: Enterprise-level restrictions for sensitive data
- **Time-to-Live (TTL)**: Data retention controls at organization and project levels
- **Block Filters**: Ingestion-level data filtering (e.g., for bot traffic)
- **Drop Filters**: Query-time filtering that maintains raw data integrity

## Implementation Approaches

Amplitude Data supports multiple implementation strategies:

1. **Client-side Tracking**:
   - Browser SDK for web applications
   - Mobile SDKs for iOS (Swift) and Android (Kotlin)
   - Platform-specific plugins (Shopify, WordPress)

2. **Server-side Tracking**:
   - HTTP V2 API endpoint: `https://api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`
   - Batch Event Upload API: `https://api2.amplitude.com/batch`
   - Server-side SDKs for various programming languages

3. **Hybrid Approaches**:
   - Combined client/server tracking for comprehensive coverage
   - Server-side handling of sensitive operations with client-side tracking of user interactions

## Technical Implementation Details

### API Endpoints
- **HTTP V2 API**: `https://api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi` - For server-side event tracking
- **Batch Event Upload API**: `https://api2.amplitude.com/batch` - For historical data backfills
- **Taxonomy API**: Programmatic management of taxonomy elements

### SDK Configuration Options
- `batchEvents`: Controls event batching behavior
- `eventUploadThreshold`: Sets batch size threshold
- `trackingOptions`: Configures privacy controls
- `cssSelectorAllowlist`: Restricts Autocapture scope
- `pageUrlAllowlist`: Limits tracking to specific pages

### Collaborative Workflow Features
- **Branching**: Isolated environments for tracking plan changes
- **Version Publishing**: Formalized release process
- **Merge Requests**: Structured change integration
- **Environment Settings**: Environment-specific tracking plan mapping
- **Team Reviews**: Approval workflows for changes
- **Jira Integration**: Development ticket linkage
- **AI Data Assistant**: Automated tracking plan suggestions

The platform emphasizes best practices including consistent naming conventions, environment separation, proper user identification, and thoughtful configuration of session tracking and property operations to ensure high-quality analytics data.
