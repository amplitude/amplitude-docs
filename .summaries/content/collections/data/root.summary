# Amplitude Data: Comprehensive Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude Data is a comprehensive data governance and management platform that helps organizations define, track, verify, and improve the quality of their analytics data. The platform provides tools for planning data collection, implementing tracking plans, validating data quality, and transforming data to ensure accurate analytics. Amplitude Data serves as the foundation for the broader Amplitude Analytics ecosystem, enabling organizations to make data-driven decisions with confidence in their data quality.

Key features of Amplitude Data include:
- Data planning and instrumentation tools for creating structured tracking plans
- Type-safe tracking implementation through the Ampli toolkit
- Data validation and quality monitoring
- Data transformation capabilities for retroactive corrections
- Integration with third-party platforms through event streaming
- Advanced data enrichment through custom events, derived properties, and lookup tables
- AI-powered data assistant for tracking plan maintenance

## Product Relationships and Architecture

Amplitude Data functions as the data governance layer within the broader Amplitude ecosystem, with several interconnected components:

1. **Data Planning and Instrumentation**:
   - Tracking Plans: Central schema definitions for events, properties, and sources
   - Ampli Developer Tools: SDK wrappers that generate type-safe code based on tracking plans
   - Branching Workflow: Git-like version control for tracking plan changes

2. **Data Collection**:
   - Client-side SDKs: Browser SDK, iOS Swift SDK, Android-Kotlin SDK
   - Server-side SDKs: For backend implementation
   - HTTP API: For direct data ingestion
   - Plugins: Pre-built integrations for platforms like Shopify and WordPress

3. **Data Validation and Monitoring**:
   - Observe: Real-time validation of incoming events against tracking plans
   - Schema Violation Handling: Controls for managing unexpected data
   - Visual Labeling: UI for creating labeled events from Autocapture data

4. **Data Transformation and Enrichment**:
   - Transformations: Query-time modifications to correct implementation issues
   - Custom Events: Combinations of existing events
   - Derived Properties: Formula-based property creation
   - Lookup Tables: CSV-based property enrichment
   - Channels: UTM and referrer-based classification

5. **Data Integration**:
   - Event Streaming: Sharing behavioral data with external tools
   - Cohort Synchronization: Exporting user segments to third-party platforms
   - Profiles: Integration with data warehouses (Snowflake, Databricks, S3)

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Tracking Plan**: A structured schema that defines events, properties, and sources for data collection.

2. **Events**: User actions or system occurrences tracked in Amplitude, categorized as:
   - Active Events: Included in dashboard metrics
   - Inactive Events: Excluded from dashboard metrics but still count toward volume
   - Custom Events: Combinations of multiple events using OR logic

3. **Properties**:
   - Event Properties: Attributes of specific events at the time they occur
   - User Properties: Persistent attributes of individual users
   - Group Properties: Attributes of organizational groups
   - Property Groups: Collections of properties that can be applied to multiple events

4. **Data Sources**:
   - Client-side Sources: Code running on user devices (mobile/web apps)
   - Server-side Sources: Code running on servers
   - Third-party Sources: External platforms integrated with Amplitude

5. **Autocapture**: Automatic collection of user interactions without manual instrumentation:
   - Element Clicked events: User clicks on webpage elements
   - Element Changed events: User inputs in forms and fields
   - Page View events: User navigation between pages

6. **Data Transformations**:
   - Merge Events: Combine multiple event types
   - Merge Properties: Combine multiple properties
   - Rename Property Values: Change specific property values
   - Hide Property Values: Remove specific property values

7. **Environments**:
   - Production: Live user-facing environment
   - Development/Testing: Environments for testing implementations

8. **Branches**: Isolated versions of tracking plans for collaborative development.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Data integrates with the broader Amplitude ecosystem and third-party tools:

1. **Amplitude Analytics**: Data from Amplitude Data flows into Analytics for visualization and analysis.

2. **Amplitude Experiment**: Uses the data collected through Amplitude Data to measure experiment outcomes.

3. **Amplitude CDP**: Leverages user profiles and behaviors tracked in Amplitude Data.

4. **Third-party Integrations**:
   - Marketing platforms (Braze, AppsFlyer)
   - CRM systems
   - Data warehouses (Snowflake, Databricks)
   - Development tools (Jira)

5. **Data Portfolios**: Enable cross-project analysis by combining multiple source projects.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

### Amplitude SDKs

1. **Browser SDK**:
   ```javascript
   amplitude.getInstance().init("API_KEY", null, {
     trackingOptions: {
       ipAddress: false,
       city: true
     },
     batchEvents: true,
     eventUploadThreshold: 30
   });
   ```

2. **Ampli SDK Wrapper**:
   ```javascript
   // After generating code from tracking plan
   ampli.load({ client: { apiKey: "API_KEY" } });
   ampli.itemPurchased({ price: 15.99, itemName: "Widget" });
   ```

### HTTP APIs

1. **HTTP V2 API** for event ingestion:
   - Endpoint: `https://api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`
   - Method: POST
   - Batch limit: 1000 events per request

2. **Batch Event Upload API** for data backfill:
   - Endpoint: `https://api2.amplitude.com/batch`
   - Throttling: 300 events per second per device ID
   - Daily limit: 500K events

3. **Taxonomy API** for programmatic tracking plan management:
   - Endpoints for managing categories, event types, and properties
   - Requires special access coordination with Amplitude support

### Command Line Tools

1. **Ampli CLI**:
   ```bash
   # Pull tracking plan changes
   ampli pull
   
   # Check status of local tracking plan
   ampli status
   
   # Generate type-safe code
   ampli generate
   ```

## Data Management Features

1. **Data Access Control**: Enterprise feature to restrict access to sensitive data through permission groups.

2. **Time-to-Live (TTL)**: Enterprise feature to control data retention periods at organization and project levels.

3. **Data Validation**: Schema violation handling with options to mark as unexpected or reject data.

4. **Visual Labeling**: Create labeled events by clicking elements on websites with Autocapture enabled.

5. **AI Data Assistant**: Automatically generates suggestions for tracking plan improvements.

6. **Object Management**: Centralized management of analysis objects (custom events, metrics, segments, cohorts).
