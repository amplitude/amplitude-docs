Amplitude Data is a comprehensive data governance and management platform that provides tools for planning, implementing, and maintaining analytics instrumentation across the entire data lifecycle. The platform serves as a centralized data catalog that enables organizations to create structured tracking plans, generate type-safe code, monitor data quality, and transform data retroactively.

## Core Product Architecture and Features

**Data Planning and Instrumentation**
Amplitude Data centers around tracking plans - structured schemas that define events, event properties, user properties, and groups. The platform supports a Git-like branching workflow where teams can create feature branches, make changes collaboratively, and merge back to main after stakeholder reviews. The Ampli Developer Tools generate type-safe tracking libraries from these plans, providing autocompletion and compile-time validation for multiple SDKs including Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Unity, Flutter, Node.js, Go, Python, and Java.

**Data Ingestion and Sources**
The platform supports both client-side SDKs (Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Unity, Flutter) and server-side SDKs (Node.js, Go, Python, Java) for data collection. Data can be ingested through HTTP V2 API, Batch Event Upload API, third-party integrations via the source catalog, cloud storage imports (Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage), and specialized plugins for Shopify and WordPress. The system includes Autocapture functionality for automatically tracking user interactions like clicks, page views, and form submissions.

**Data Transformation and Enhancement**
Amplitude Data provides several transformation capabilities that work retroactively without modifying raw data:
- **Derived Properties**: Enterprise-only feature using formulas with string, math, date, array, and conditional functions
- **Lookup Tables**: CSV-based property enrichment with 100MB/1M row limits
- **Transformations**: Merge events/properties, rename values, and hide data
- **Custom Events**: Combine multiple events with OR clauses
- **Channels**: Create retroactive UTM and referrer-based acquisition classifiers

**Data Quality and Observability**
The Observe feature continuously monitors event streams against tracking plans, identifying schema violations, missing properties, wrong data types, and out-of-date events. The AI Data Assistant automatically generates prioritized suggestions for tracking plan improvements based on event volume and query patterns. Visual Labeling enables no-code event creation through DOM element selection on websites with Autocapture enabled.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events and Properties**
- **Events**: User actions or occurrences tracked in the system (e.g., "Product Viewed", "Checkout Completed")
- **Event Properties**: Attributes specific to individual events at the time they occurred
- **User Properties**: Attributes of users that persist and update over time (device type, location, User ID)
- **Group Properties**: Account-level attributes for B2B analytics (requires Accounts add-on)

**Data Management Concepts**
- **Tracking Plan**: Structured schema defining all events and properties for a project
- **Sources**: SDK configurations within tracking plans that generate type-safe code
- **Property Groups**: Collections of event properties that can be bulk-applied to multiple events
- **Schema Violations**: Unplanned events, properties, or property values that don't match the tracking plan
- **Active vs Inactive Events**: Status determining whether events count toward active user metrics

**Advanced Features**
- **Autocapture**: Automatic tracking of user interactions without manual instrumentation
- **Ampli**: Code generation tool creating type-safe SDK wrappers from tracking plans
- **Profiles**: Integration with data warehouses using Change Data Capture (CDC) for customer profile data
- **Data Mutability**: INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations on event data through Mirror Sync strategies

## Product Ecosystem Integration

**Analytics Integration**
Amplitude Data serves as the governance layer for Amplitude Analytics, with tracking plans directly informing chart creation, user segmentation, and funnel analysis. Events can be marked as active/inactive to control their inclusion in analytics calculations, and custom events created in Data appear with [Custom] prefixes in Analytics charts.

**Warehouse and Cloud Integration**
The platform integrates deeply with data warehouses (Snowflake, Databricks) and cloud storage (Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage) through:
- **Mirror Sync**: Bidirectional synchronization with Change Data Capture
- **Data Backfill**: Historical data import via Batch Event Upload API with 500K events per device ID daily limits
- **Profiles**: Customer profile data joining using CDC with incremental modeling

**Third-Party Ecosystem**
Extensive integration capabilities include:
- **Source Catalog**: Pre-built connectors for data ingestion
- **Destination Catalog**: Real-time event streaming to marketing and sales tools
- **Cohort Syncing**: User segment synchronization with ad networks and marketing platforms
- **Developer Tools**: Jira integration for automatic issue creation on tracking plan changes

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Core APIs**
- **HTTP V2 API**: Real-time event ingestion endpoint
- **Batch Event Upload API**: Historical data import with rate limiting (100 batches/1000 events per second)
- **Evaluation API**: Server-side experiment evaluation
- **Taxonomy API**: CRUD operations for events, properties, and categories
- **User Privacy API**: GDPR/CCPA compliance for data deletion

**Command Line Tools**
- **Ampli CLI**: `ampli pull` for code generation, `ampli status --is-merged` for branch validation
- **Chrome Extension**: Event Explorer/Instrumentation Explorer for real-time debugging

**Configuration Options**
Key SDK configuration parameters include `batchEvents`, `eventUploadThreshold`, `sessionTimeout`, `minTimeBetweenSessions`, `trackingOptions`, and Autocapture settings like `config.autocapture.elementInteractions`.

**Data Processing**
The platform handles IP address processing with MaxMind GeoIP lookups, automatic user agent parsing for device properties, and supports advanced filtering through drop filters (query-time) and block filters (ingestion-time). Time-to-Live (TTL) configuration enables automated data retention management at organization and project levels.
