Amplitude Data is a comprehensive data governance and catalog management platform that serves as the central nervous system for analytics instrumentation across organizations. The platform provides end-to-end tools for planning, implementing, and managing data collection workflows, acting as a governance layer between raw data collection and analytics consumption.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform operates on a Git-like branching model where users create feature branches from main, modify tracking plans, publish versioned changes, and merge back after stakeholder review. This collaborative workflow enables environment-specific testing and team-based development of data schemas.

Amplitude Data integrates deeply with Amplitude Analytics projects and supports cross-project analysis through portfolios that combine up to 5 source projects with schema ranking for conflict resolution. The system serves as both a planning tool for future instrumentation and a management layer for existing data streams.

## Key Features and Capabilities

**Data Planning and Schema Management:**
- Tracking plan creation defining events, event properties, user properties, and group properties
- Ampli Developer Tools generating type-safe, autogenerated tracking libraries from schemas
- Visual Labeling enabling no-code event creation through DOM element selection
- Autocapture functionality for automatic user interaction tracking (clicks, page views, sessions, form interactions)
- Schema validation with configurable violation handling (mark as unexpected or reject data)

**Data Transformation and Enhancement:**
- Derived Properties creating retroactive event and user properties using formulas and functions
- Lookup Tables enriching properties by mapping CSV data sources to ingested properties
- Transformations enabling retroactive data structure modifications at query time
- Custom Events combining multiple existing events with OR clauses
- Currency conversion through OOTB derived properties and CURRENCY_CONVERT function

**Data Quality and Observability:**
- Observe feature providing automatic event stream validation against tracking plans
- AI Data Assistant generating prioritized tracking plan improvement suggestions
- Drop filters for query-time data filtering and block filters for ingestion-time blocking
- Data Access Control (DAC) managing sensitive data access through property classification
- Chrome Extension (Amplitude Instrumentation Explorer) for real-time SDK debugging

**Integration and Data Movement:**
- Destination event streaming for real-time behavioral data forwarding to downstream tools
- Cohort synchronization with third-party destinations (one-time, scheduled, real-time)
- Source and destination catalogs for third-party integrations
- Profiles feature joining warehouse customer data with behavioral data using Change Data Capture
- WordPress and Shopify plugins for simplified SDK integration

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Data Entities:**
- **Events**: User actions or occurrences tracked in the system (e.g., "Button Clicked", "Page Viewed")
- **Event Properties**: Attributes specific to individual events at occurrence time
- **User Properties**: Persistent user attributes across sessions (device type, location, User ID)
- **Group Properties**: Account-level entity attributes (requires Accounts add-on)

**Schema and Planning:**
- **Tracking Plan**: Schema definition containing all events, properties, and specifications
- **Sources**: SDK or integration configurations within tracking plans
- **Property Groups**: Collections of event properties bulk-applicable to multiple events
- **Branches**: Feature development environments for tracking plan modifications

**Data Processing Concepts:**
- **Autocapture**: Automatic user interaction capture without manual instrumentation
- **Ampli**: Code generation tool creating type-safe SDK wrappers from tracking plans
- **Schema Violations**: Data not matching defined tracking plan structure
- **Transformations**: Retroactive event data structure modifications at query time

**Access Control:**
- **Roles**: Admin, Manager, Member, Viewer with hierarchical permission levels
- **Data Access Control (DAC)**: Enterprise feature for sensitive data access management
- **Property Classification**: Categorizing properties as PII, revenue, or sensitive data

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Data functions as the foundational data layer for the broader Amplitude ecosystem:

**Core Amplitude Products:**
- **Amplitude Analytics**: Direct project mapping and cross-project portfolio analysis
- **Amplitude Experiment**: SDK integration for A/B testing with tracking plan validation

**Third-party Integrations:**
- **Customer Data Platforms**: Segment, mParticle, Tealium for unified data collection
- **E-commerce Platforms**: Shopify, WordPress plugins for simplified implementation
- **Data Warehouses**: Snowflake, Databricks, Amazon S3 for data import/export and Change Data Capture

**Development Ecosystem:**
- Git-like workflow integration for version control
- Jira integration for issue tracking and project management
- Comprehensive SDK support across client-side and server-side environments

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Core APIs:**
- **Taxonomy API**: CRUD operations for categories, event types, event properties, and user properties
- **HTTP V2 API**: Client-side event ingestion with real-time processing
- **Batch Event Upload API**: Server-side and historical data import with 500K events per device ID daily limit
- **User Privacy API**: Data deletion capabilities for GDPR/CCPA compliance

**SDK Integration Commands:**
- **Ampli CLI**: `ampli pull` for tracking plan synchronization, `ampli status --is-merged` for branch status verification
- **Configuration Parameters**: `batchEvents`, `sessionTimeout`, `minTimeBetweenSessions` for SDK behavior control
- **Tracking Options**: `trackingOptions` for automatic data collection control
- **Autocapture Filtering**: `cssSelectorAllowlist`, `actionClickAllowlist` for selective capture

**Platform Limits and Performance:**
- **Ingestion Rates**: 100 batches/second, 1000 events/second for Batch API
- **Data Limits**: 100MB/1M rows for Lookup Tables
- **Performance Targets**: P95 latency of 60 seconds for event streaming
- **SDK Support**: Client-side (Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Unity, Flutter) and server-side (Node.js, Go, Python, Java)

The platform supports both real-time and batch processing workflows with comprehensive monitoring, retry mechanisms, and data quality controls throughout the ingestion and processing pipeline, making it suitable for enterprise-scale analytics implementations.
