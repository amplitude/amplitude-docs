# Amplitude Data: Comprehensive Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude Data is a comprehensive data governance platform that helps organizations define, track, verify, and improve the quality of their analytics data. The platform provides tools for data planning, instrumentation, management, and observability, enabling teams to create consistent tracking plans, implement reliable data collection, and maintain high-quality analytics data throughout the product lifecycle.

Key features of Amplitude Data include:

1. **Data Planning and Instrumentation**: Create structured tracking plans, define events and properties, and implement tracking using type-safe code generation tools.
2. **Data Management**: Enrich metadata, clean up data, create custom events, and transform properties to improve data quality.
3. **Data Observability**: Monitor data quality in real-time, validate events against tracking plans, and identify issues before they impact analysis.
4. **AI-Powered Assistance**: Use AI Data Assistant to maintain organized tracking plans with automated suggestions.
5. **Integration Capabilities**: Connect with various data sources and destinations, enabling seamless data flow across the analytics ecosystem.

## Product Relationships and Features

### Data Planning and Instrumentation

1. **Tracking Plans**: Central to Amplitude Data is the ability to create and manage tracking plans that define events, properties, and sources in a structured format. Tracking plans serve as the source of truth for data collection.

2. **Ampli Developer Tools**: A lightweight wrapper for Amplitude SDKs that generates type-safe code based on tracking plans, providing autocompletion and validation during development.

3. **Branches**: Support collaborative workflows by allowing teams to create isolated branches for tracking plan changes, which can be reviewed and merged back to the main branch.

4. **Environment Settings**: Map different environments (production/development) to specific Amplitude Analytics projects, allowing for testing before deploying to production.

### Data Collection Methods

1. **Client-side Tracking**: Implemented through Browser SDK (for web), iOS Swift SDK, and Android-Kotlin SDK, capturing user interactions directly from user devices.

2. **Server-side Tracking**: Implemented through server SDKs (Node.js, etc.) and HTTP V2 API, sending events from backend systems.

3. **Autocapture**: Automatically collect user interactions like clicks, page views, and form submissions with minimal setup.

4. **Visual Labeling**: Allow non-technical users to create labeled events by clicking on website elements without code changes.

5. **Plugins**: Pre-built integrations for platforms like WordPress and Shopify to simplify implementation.

### Data Management

1. **Transformations**: Retroactively modify event data to correct implementation mistakes without changing code, including merging events, renaming properties, and hiding values.

2. **Derived Properties**: Create new event and user properties using formulas applied to existing properties.

3. **Custom Events**: Combine multiple existing events with OR clauses to track related user activities as a single event.

4. **Lookup Tables**: Import custom data to map and enhance existing event and user properties, enabling property enrichment.

5. **Channels**: Create retroactive property classifications based on UTM and referrer data for better marketing attribution.

6. **Profiles**: Join customer profile data from data warehouses with behavioral product data.

### Data Governance

1. **Schema Configuration**: Control how unexpected data is handled through violation types (unplanned event types, properties, or values).

2. **Data Access Control**: Restrict access to sensitive data through permission groups (Enterprise feature).

3. **Time-to-Live (TTL)**: Control event data retention periods at organization and project levels (Enterprise feature).

4. **Object Management**: Centrally create, update, and manage analysis objects like custom events, metrics, segments, and cohorts.

### Data Quality and Observability

1. **Validation**: Automatically monitor event tracking against tracking plans to identify issues.

2. **Chrome Extension Debug**: Debug Amplitude JS SDK instrumentation in real-time.

3. **Invalid Data Management**: Remove or filter invalid data using drop filters, block filters, and deletion options.

### Integration Capabilities

1. **Source Catalog**: Connect to various data sources to bring data into Amplitude.

2. **Destination Catalog**: Stream data to downstream tools and platforms.

3. **Event Streaming**: Share behavioral data with downstream tools with a target p95 latency of 60 seconds.

4. **Cohort Synchronization**: Export user segments to third-party platforms with one-time, scheduled, or real-time sync options.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Events**: User actions or occurrences tracked in Amplitude (e.g., page views, button clicks).

2. **Event Properties**: Attributes of specific events at the time they occur (e.g., button color, page URL).

3. **User Properties**: Attributes of individual users that persist across events (e.g., device type, subscription status).

4. **Group Properties**: Attributes of groups that users belong to (e.g., company size, plan type).

5. **Property Groups**: Collections of properties that can be applied to multiple events simultaneously.

6. **Sources**: Origins of data, including client-side applications, server-side systems, or third-party integrations.

7. **Tracking Plan**: A specification that defines events, properties, and their relationships.

8. **Schema Violations**: Unexpected data that doesn't conform to the tracking plan (unplanned events, properties, or values).

9. **Transformations**: Query-time modifications to event data that don't affect raw data.

10. **Branches**: Isolated environments for making tracking plan changes before merging to production.

11. **Autocapture**: Automatic collection of user interactions without manual instrumentation.

12. **Visual Labeling**: Creating labeled events through a visual interface on top of Autocapture events.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Data integrates with the broader Amplitude product ecosystem:

1. **Amplitude Analytics**: Data collected and managed through Amplitude Data powers analytics in Amplitude's core analytics platform.

2. **Experiment**: Quality data from Amplitude Data enables more reliable experimentation results.

3. **Session Replay**: Integrates with Autocapture to provide visual context for user interactions.

4. **Data Warehouse Integration**: Connects with Snowflake, Databricks, and S3 for profile data integration.

5. **Third-Party Tools**: Streams data to marketing, customer engagement, and data platforms through the destination catalog.
