Amplitude Data is a comprehensive data governance and management platform that serves as the centralized control layer for analytics instrumentation across the entire data lifecycle. The platform functions as a data catalog that enables organizations to create structured tracking plans, generate type-safe code, and ensure data quality through real-time monitoring and validation.

## Core Platform Architecture

Amplitude Data operates as the governance backbone for Amplitude's analytics ecosystem, integrating with multiple data ingestion methods including client-side SDKs (Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Unity, Flutter), server-side SDKs (Node.js, Go, Python, Java), and third-party integrations. The platform supports both real-time event streaming through the HTTP V2 API and batch processing via the Batch Event Upload API, with specialized endpoints including the Evaluation API for experimentation features and the Taxonomy API for CRUD operations on data schemas.

The system employs a Git-like branching model for tracking plan management, enabling teams to create feature branches, implement changes through merge requests with team reviews, and publish versioned tracking plans. This workflow integrates with the Ampli CLI tool, which generates type-safe wrapper code for SDKs based on tracking plan definitions, providing compile-time validation and autocompletion for developers.

## Data Ingestion and Processing Pipeline

The platform handles multiple data ingestion pathways with specific technical requirements and rate limitations. Data processing includes automatic IP address resolution through MaxMind GeoIP lookup for location properties (location_lat, location_long), user agent string parsing for device information (device_brand, device_manufacturer, device_model, os_name, os_version), and bot traffic filtering using the IAB/ABC International Spiders and Bots List.

For high-volume scenarios, the Batch Event Upload API supports data backfill with ingestion limits of 500K events per device ID daily, 100 batches per second, and 1000 events per second. The system includes throttling mechanisms (429 response codes) and supports the `$skip_user_properties_sync` flag for maintaining data integrity during historical imports.

## Schema Management and Data Validation

The schema management system categorizes three types of violations: unplanned event types, unplanned event/user properties, and unplanned property values. Organizations can configure responses to either "Mark As Unexpected" or "Reject" each violation type. The Observe feature provides real-time monitoring by analyzing event streams against tracking plans, categorizing events with statuses (Unexpected, Valid, Invalid, Out of Date).

Schema configuration supports complex data structures including property groups for bulk management, derived properties using formula editors with functions like REGEXEXTRACT, SPLIT, CONCAT, and mathematical operators, and lookup tables for property enrichment through CSV imports (limited to 100MB/1M rows with case-sensitive exact matching).

## Advanced Data Transformation and Analysis

Amplitude Data includes sophisticated transformation capabilities that allow retroactive modification of event data structure at query time without affecting raw data in connected warehouses. These transformations support merging events/properties, renaming property values, and hiding values, applying only to the main branch while preserving raw data integrity.

The platform supports multi-currency revenue analysis through out-of-the-box derived properties (Currency Converted Revenue/Price) and the CURRENCY_CONVERT() function, utilizing ISO 4217 currency codes and ExchangeRate API integration. Custom events functionality enables combining multiple existing events with OR clauses for tracking related user activities across various chart types.

## Integration and Destination Management

The platform maintains extensive integration capabilities through source and destination catalogs. Event streaming destinations enable real-time behavioral data forwarding to downstream marketing, sales, and infrastructure tools with 60-second p95 latency targets and exponential backoff retry mechanisms. Cohort synchronization supports three cadence options: one-time, scheduled (hourly/daily), and real-time (every minute) syncing.

Specialized plugins extend functionality to platforms including Shopify (with Web Pixels API integration for checkout tracking) and WordPress (with advanced Autocapture functionality). The Chrome extension Amplitude Instrumentation Explorer provides real-time debugging capabilities for JavaScript SDK instrumentation.

## Enterprise Data Governance and Security

Enterprise-level features include Data Access Control (DAC) for managing sensitive data through property classification (PII, revenue, sensitive) and group-based permissions. The system supports chart blocking, Event Stream restrictions, and export/subscription enforcement with customizable access controls.

Data mutability features enable INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations through Mirror Sync strategies across Snowflake (CDC), Databricks (CDF), and Amazon S3 warehouse integrations. Time-to-Live (TTL) configuration allows organization and project-level event data retention with daily deletion jobs and configurable retention periods.
