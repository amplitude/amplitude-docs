Amplitude Data is a comprehensive data governance and management platform that provides tools for planning, implementing, and maintaining analytics instrumentation across the entire data lifecycle. The platform serves as a centralized data catalog that enables organizations to create structured tracking plans, generate type-safe code, and ensure data quality through automated monitoring and validation.

## Core Product Architecture and Features

**Data Planning and Instrumentation**
Amplitude Data centers around tracking plans - structured schemas that define events, event properties, user properties, and groups. The platform supports a Git-like branching workflow where teams can create feature branches, make changes collaboratively, and merge back to main after stakeholder reviews. The Ampli Developer Tools generate type-safe tracking libraries from these plans, providing autocompletion and compile-time validation for multiple SDKs including Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Unity, Flutter, Node.js, Go, Python, and Java.

**Data Ingestion and Sources**
The platform supports both client-side SDKs (Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Unity, Flutter) and server-side SDKs (Node.js, Go, Python, Java) for data collection. Integration extends to third-party sources through the source catalog, cloud storage imports (Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage), data warehouse connections (Snowflake, Databricks), and specialized plugins for Shopify and WordPress. The HTTP V2 API and Batch Event Upload API provide direct ingestion capabilities with specific limits (500K events per device ID daily, 100 batches/1000 events per second).

**Data Transformation and Enhancement**
Amplitude Data provides several mechanisms for data enhancement:
- **Derived Properties**: Enterprise-only feature for creating new properties retroactively using formulas with functions like REGEXEXTRACT, SPLIT, DATE_TIME_FORMATTER
- **Transformations**: Retroactive modification of event data structure including merging events/properties, renaming values, and hiding data
- **Custom Events**: Combining multiple existing events with OR clauses for analysis
- **Lookup Tables**: CSV-based property enrichment with 100MB/1M row limits
- **Channels**: Retroactive property classifiers based on UTM and referrer data for acquisition tracking

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events and Properties**
- **Events**: User actions or occurrences tracked in the system (e.g., "Product Viewed", "Checkout Completed")
- **Event Properties**: Attributes specific to individual events at the time they occurred
- **User Properties**: Attributes of users that persist and update over time (device type, location, User ID)
- **Group Properties**: Account-level properties available with the Accounts add-on

**Data Management Concepts**
- **Tracking Plan**: Structured schema defining all events and properties for a project
- **Sources**: SDK configurations within tracking plans that generate type-safe code
- **Property Groups**: Collections of event properties that can be bulk-applied to multiple events
- **Schema Violations**: Unplanned event types, properties, or property values that can be marked as unexpected or rejected
- **Active vs Inactive Events**: Status affecting whether events count toward active user metrics

**Advanced Features**
- **Autocapture**: Automatic capture of user interactions (clicks, page views, form interactions) with minimal setup
- **Visual Labeling**: No-code event creation through DOM element selection on websites
- **Data Access Control (DAC)**: Enterprise feature for managing access to sensitive data through property classification and group-based permissions
- **Profiles**: Integration of customer profile data from warehouses using Change Data Capture (CDC)

## Product Ecosystem Integration

**Analytics Integration**
Amplitude Data serves as the foundation for Amplitude Analytics, providing the schema and data quality layer. Events and properties defined in Data flow into Analytics for behavioral analysis, with features like cross-project analysis through portfolios that combine up to 5 source projects.

**Experiment Integration**
The platform integrates with Amplitude Experiment through dedicated Experiment SDKs and the Evaluation API, enabling feature flagging and A/B testing with the same instrumentation foundation.

**Warehouse and Infrastructure**
Data Mutability features enable bidirectional sync with warehouses through Mirror Sync strategies supporting INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations. The platform connects to Snowflake (CDC), Databricks (CDF), and Amazon S3 with specific change tracking requirements.

**Third-Party Ecosystem**
Destination event streaming enables real-time data sharing to downstream tools with p95 latency targets of 60 seconds. The platform supports cohort synchronization with marketing platforms through one-time, scheduled, or real-time sync cadences.

## API Endpoints and Command Line Tools

**Core APIs**
- **HTTP V2 API**: Primary endpoint for event ingestion
- **Batch Event Upload API**: Bulk historical data import with specific rate limits
- **Taxonomy API**: CRUD operations for categories, event types, and properties
- **Evaluation API**: Server-side experiment evaluation
- **User Privacy API**: GDPR/CCPA compliance for data deletion

**Ampli CLI Commands**
- `ampli pull`: Generate tracking libraries from tracking plans
- `ampli status --is-merged`: Check branch merge status for deployment validation

**Configuration and Management**
The platform provides extensive configuration through project settings covering General, Environments, Integrations, API Tokens, and Schema Settings. Role-based permissions (Admin/Manager/Member/Viewer) control access to different features, with Enterprise organizations having additional Data Access Control capabilities.

**Monitoring and Observability**
The Observe feature automatically monitors event streams against tracking plans, surfacing data quality issues without code changes. The AI Data Assistant provides automated suggestions for tracking plan improvements based on event volume and query patterns. Chrome extension debugging tools (Event Explorer/Instrumentation Explorer) enable real-time SDK instrumentation validation.
