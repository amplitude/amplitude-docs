# Amplitude Data: Product Overview

Amplitude Data is a comprehensive data governance platform designed to help organizations define, track, verify, and improve the quality of their analytics data. It provides end-to-end tools for data planning, instrumentation, management, and observability to ensure consistent, high-quality analytics implementation across an organization.

## Key Features and Capabilities

### Data Planning and Instrumentation
- **Tracking Plans**: Serve as central specifications for events, properties, and sources, defining what data should be collected and how it should be structured
- **Branching Workflow**: Enables collaborative environment for making isolated changes to tracking plans before integrating into production
- **Ampli Developer Toolkit**: Generates type-safe, autogenerated code based on tracking plans to ensure error-free implementation
- **Visual Labeling**: Provides a no-code event tracking interface allowing non-technical users to create labeled events by simply clicking elements on websites

### Data Management
- **Metadata Enrichment**: Allows adding descriptions, display names, and categorizations to events and properties
- **Property Groups**: Enables creation of collections of properties that can be applied to multiple events simultaneously
- **Transformations**: Supports retroactive modifications to correct implementation mistakes without changing code
- **Custom Events**: Allows combining multiple existing events with OR clauses to track related activities
- **Derived Properties**: Enables creation of new properties retroactively using functions and operators
- **Lookup Tables**: Supports importing custom data to map and enhance existing properties (limited to 100MB or 1 million rows)
- **Data Access Control**: Restricts access to sensitive data through permission groups (Enterprise tier only)

### Data Observability
- **Validation**: Automatically monitors event tracking against tracking plans
- **AI Data Assistant**: Generates prioritized suggestions for tracking plan improvements
- **Schema Violation Handling**: Configures how to handle unexpected data (mark as unexpected or reject)

### Data Collection Methods
- **Client-side Tracking**: Browser SDK, iOS Swift SDK, Android-Kotlin SDK
- **Server-side Tracking**: Server SDKs for various programming languages
- **Autocapture**: Automatic collection of user interactions with minimal setup
- **Plugins**: Pre-built integrations for platforms like WordPress and Shopify

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Events**: User actions or system occurrences tracked in the platform
- **Event Properties**: Attributes specific to individual events that provide context
- **User Properties**: Attributes that persist across a user's sessions
- **Group Properties**: Attributes associated with organizational groupings
- **Sources**: Origins of data, categorized as client-side, server-side, or third-party
- **Tracking Plan**: Formal specification of events and properties to be collected
- **Schema Violations**: Unexpected data that doesn't match the defined tracking plan
- **Transformations**: Query-time modifications applied to correct data issues
- **Autocapture**: Automatic tracking of user interactions without requiring manual instrumentation
- **Ampli**: Lightweight wrapper for Amplitude SDKs that enforces tracking plan compliance

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Data integrates with the broader Amplitude product ecosystem:
- **Amplitude Analytics**: Data collected through Amplitude Data feeds directly into Analytics for analysis
- **Portfolios**: Enables combining multiple source projects for cross-product analysis
- **Event Streaming**: Facilitates sharing behavioral data with external tools and destinations
- **Cohort Synchronization**: Allows exporting user segments to third-party platforms
- **Profiles**: Joins customer profile data from data warehouses with behavioral product data
