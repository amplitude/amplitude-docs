Amplitude Data is a comprehensive data governance and management platform that serves as the central orchestration layer for analytics instrumentation across the entire data lifecycle. The platform functions as a unified data catalog that enables organizations to create structured tracking plans, generate type-safe code, and maintain data quality through real-time monitoring and validation.

## Product Architecture and Core Components

The platform operates through several interconnected systems that form a complete data governance ecosystem:

**Tracking Plans** function as the foundational schema definition system, enabling teams to define events, event properties, user properties, and group properties in structured formats. These plans support Git-like branching workflows with collaborative development features including merge requests, team reviews, and environment-specific deployments.

**Ampli Developer Tools** provide automated code generation that transforms tracking plans into type-safe libraries across multiple programming languages and frameworks. The Ampli CLI offers key commands including `ampli pull` for synchronizing tracking plans with codebases and `ampli status --is-merged` for validating implementation status.

**Data Ingestion Infrastructure** supports multiple ingestion pathways through client-side SDKs (Browser, Android, iOS, Unity, Flutter, React Native), server-side SDKs (Node.js, Go, Python, Java), and third-party integrations. The system utilizes both HTTP V2 API and Batch Event Upload API for different ingestion patterns.

## Key Features and Data Management Capabilities

**Schema Management** enforces data structure through configurable violation handling with two primary modes: "Mark As Unexpected" or "Reject" for three violation types: unplanned event types, unplanned properties, and unplanned property values.

**Data Transformations** enable retroactive modification of event data structure at query time without affecting raw data integrity. This includes event/property merging, property value renaming, and value hiding to address post-implementation corrections.

**Derived Properties** (Enterprise feature) allow creation of new event and user properties retroactively using formula functions including REGEXEXTRACT, SPLIT, CONCAT, DATE_TIME_FORMATTER, and CURRENCY_CONVERT applied to existing properties.

**Autocapture** automatically captures user interactions (clicks, page views, sessions, form interactions) across Browser SDK, iOS Swift SDK, and Android-Kotlin SDK with minimal configuration, including visual labeling capabilities for non-technical users.

**Data Quality Monitoring** through the Observe feature validates events against tracking plans in real-time, categorizing them with statuses: Unexpected, Valid, Invalid, and Out of Date, providing immediate insights into data quality issues.

## Advanced Data Operations

**Lookup Tables** enable property enrichment by importing CSV data sources (maximum 100MB/1M rows) with case-sensitive exact matching to ingested properties for data augmentation.

**Custom Events** combine multiple existing events using OR clauses to track related user activities across various chart types within Amplitude Analytics.

**Channels** provide retroactive property classification based on UTM and referrer data for acquisition channel tracking, with integration to Data Tables for attribution modeling.

**Data Access Control (DAC)** enables Enterprise organizations to classify properties as PII, revenue, or sensitive data with group-based permission control through the Groups framework.

## Integration and Ecosystem Connectivity

**Event Streaming** facilitates real-time behavioral data sharing to downstream marketing, sales, and infrastructure tools with configuration-based filtering, retry mechanisms, and 60-second p95 latency targets.

**Cohort Synchronization** supports three sync patterns: one-time, scheduled (hourly/daily), and real-time (every minute) syncing with third-party destinations.

**Data Warehouse Integration** includes Mirror Sync strategies supporting INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations through Change Data Capture (CDC) for Snowflake, Change Data Feed (CDF) for Databricks, and Amazon S3 integrations.

**Platform-Specific Plugins** include pre-built integrations for Shopify (with Session Replay and Web Experiment capabilities) and WordPress (with advanced Autocapture functionality).

## Developer Tools and APIs

The **Taxonomy API** enables CRUD operations for categories, event types, event properties, and user properties, with the restriction that only planned events and properties can be edited.

**Chrome Extension Debug Tools** include the Amplitude Instrumentation Explorer for real-time debugging of Amplitude JS SDK instrumentation with event parameter viewing and SDK configuration access.

**Data Backfill** capabilities through the Batch Event Upload API support historical data import with specific limits: 500K events per device ID daily, 100 batches/1000 events per second, and user property sync control via `$skip_user_properties_sync`.

## Enterprise and Advanced Features

**Cross-Project Analysis** through portfolios enables combining up to 5 source projects with schema ranking for conflict resolution across organizational boundaries.

**Time-to-Live (TTL)** configuration allows setting event data retention periods at organization and project levels with automated daily deletion jobs.

**Object Management** provides centralized management of reusable analysis objects including custom events, metrics, segments, and cohorts with bulk operations and official designation capabilities.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Tracking Plans**: Schema definitions that specify the structure and validation rules for analytics events
- **Ampli**: The code generation and CLI toolset for implementing tracking plans in development environments
- **Schema Violations**: Events or properties that don't conform to the defined tracking plan structure
- **Derived Properties**: Retroactively created properties using formula functions on existing data
- **Autocapture**: Automatic event collection without manual instrumentation
- **Lookup Tables**: External data sources used for property enrichment
- **Channels**: Classification system for acquisition and referrer data
- **Mirror Sync**: Data warehouse synchronization with CDC/CDF capabilities
- **Portfolios**: Cross-project analysis containers for Enterprise users

The platform integrates with external tools like Jira for automatic issue creation during feature branch changes and supports comprehensive CSV import/export functionality for tracking plan management. All features operate within Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem while maintaining data integrity and providing enterprise-grade governance capabilities across the entire data lifecycle.
