# Amplitude Data: Product Overview

Amplitude Data is a comprehensive data governance platform for defining, tracking, verifying, and improving analytics data quality. It provides end-to-end tools for the entire analytics data lifecycle, enabling organizations to maintain high-quality data for accurate insights.

## Key Features and Capabilities

### Data Planning and Instrumentation
- **Tracking Plans**: Centralized repository for defining and documenting events, properties, and data sources, serving as the source of truth for analytics implementation
- **Ampli Developer Tools**: Generates type-safe code from tracking plans to reduce implementation errors and ensure consistency across platforms
- **Visual Labeling**: Enables non-technical users to create labeled events by clicking on website elements without requiring code changes
- **Branching Workflow**: Git-like branching system for collaborative tracking plan management, allowing teams to work on changes in isolation

### Data Collection Methods
- **Client-side Tracking**: Browser and Mobile SDKs capture user interactions directly from applications
- **Server-side Tracking**: Server SDKs and HTTP APIs enable backend event tracking for system events
- **Autocapture**: Automatically collects common user interactions (clicks, page views, form submissions) with minimal configuration
- **Platform Integrations**: Pre-built plugins for Shopify, WordPress, and other platforms

### Data Management
- **Metadata Enrichment**: Add descriptions, display names, and categories to events and properties for better organization
- **Property Groups**: Reusable collections of properties that can be applied to multiple events simultaneously
- **Data Transformations**: Retroactively modify data to correct implementation mistakes without changing code
- **Custom Events**: Combine multiple events with OR clauses to track related activities as a single event
- **Derived Properties**: Create new properties using formulas applied to existing properties
- **Lookup Tables**: Enrich events by mapping property values to additional data from imported CSV files

### Data Quality and Governance
- **Schema Validation**: Configure handling of unexpected data (unplanned events, properties, values)
- **Data Observe**: Real-time monitoring of events against tracking plans to identify implementation issues
- **AI Data Assistant**: Automatically generates suggestions for tracking plan improvements
- **Data Access Control**: Restrict access to sensitive data through permission groups
- **Time-to-Live (TTL)**: Control data retention periods at organization and project levels

### Data Integration
- **Event Streaming**: Share behavioral data with external tools and platforms
- **Cohort Synchronization**: Export user segments to third-party destinations
- **Cross-Project Analysis**: Combine multiple source projects into a single portfolio view
- **Profiles**: Join customer profile data from data warehouses with behavioral product data

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Event Taxonomy
- **Events**: User actions or system occurrences tracked in Amplitude
- **Custom Events**: Virtual events that combine multiple existing events using logical operators
- **Transformed Events**: Modified versions of events with corrections or enhancements
- **Unexpected Events**: Events not defined in the tracking plan that require validation decisions

### Property Taxonomy
- **Event Properties**: Attributes specific to individual events (e.g., button_color, page_name)
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes associated with users across sessions (e.g., account_type)
- **Group Properties**: Attributes associated with organizational groupings (e.g., company_size)
- **Derived Properties**: Computed properties created from existing properties using formulas
- **Lookup Properties**: Properties enriched through lookup tables that map values to additional data

### Data Management Concepts
- **Tracking Plan**: Specification of expected events and properties serving as implementation blueprint
- **Schema Violations**: Deviations from the defined tracking plan requiring attention
- **Property Groups**: Reusable collections of properties for consistent implementation
- **Branches**: Isolated environments for tracking plan changes before merging to main
- **Environments**: Separate contexts (production/development) for testing implementation changes

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Data integrates with the broader Amplitude platform:

1. **Amplitude Analytics**: Provides the clean, structured data needed for accurate analysis in charts, funnels, and user paths
2. **Amplitude Experiment**: Ensures experiment results are based on reliable data with proper event tracking
3. **Amplitude CDP**: Enables precise audience targeting based on high-quality behavioral data
4. **Session Replay**: Enhances replay sessions with properly tracked events for better context

External integrations include:
- **Data Warehouses**: Snowflake, Databricks, and S3 for Profiles integration
- **Marketing Platforms**: Cohort synchronization with tools like Braze, AppsFlyer, and Facebook
- **Development Tools**: Jira integration for tracking implementation tasks
- **CMS Platforms**: WordPress and Shopify plugins for simplified implementation

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

### Taxonomy API
Enables programmatic management of taxonomy elements:
- `GET /api/2/taxonomy/categories` - Retrieve taxonomy categories
- `POST /api/2/taxonomy/categories` - Create new categories
- `GET /api/2/taxonomy/event-types` - Retrieve event definitions
- `POST /api/2/taxonomy/event-types` - Create or update events
- `GET /api/2/taxonomy/properties` - Retrieve property definitions
- `POST /api/2/taxonomy/properties` - Create or update properties

### Batch Event Upload API
Used for data backfills with specific limitations:
- Throttling limit: 300 events per second per device ID
- Daily limit: 500K events
- Use `$skip_user_properties_sync: true` flag for historical imports

### SDK Implementation Options
- **Browser SDK**: JavaScript/TypeScript implementation with Autocapture capabilities
- **Mobile SDKs**: iOS Swift SDK and Android-Kotlin SDK for native mobile tracking
- **Server SDKs**: Various language implementations for backend tracking
- **Ampli CLI**: Command-line tool for tracking plan implementation
  - `ampli pull`: Fetch latest tracking plan
  - `ampli status`: Check implementation status
  - `ampli generate`: Create type-safe client libraries

### Chrome Extension
The Amplitude Instrumentation Explorer helps debug SDK implementations by:
- Capturing and displaying triggered events in real-time
- Showing event parameters and configuration options
- Allowing filtering and copying of event data for troubleshooting
