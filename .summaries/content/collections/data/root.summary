Amplitude Data is a comprehensive data governance and catalog management platform that serves as the central hub for planning, implementing, and managing analytics instrumentation across organizations. The platform provides end-to-end tools for defining data taxonomy, creating tracking plans, and ensuring data quality throughout the analytics lifecycle.

## Core Product Architecture

Amplitude Data operates as a governance layer positioned between data collection and analytics, providing both planning and management capabilities. The platform integrates deeply with Amplitude Analytics projects and supports cross-project analysis through portfolios that can combine up to 5 source projects with schema ranking for conflict resolution.

The product follows a Git-like branch-based development model where users create feature branches from main, make tracking plan modifications, publish changes to create versioned tracking plans, and merge back to main after team review approvals. This workflow supports collaboration through @mention notifications and stakeholder review processes.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

**Data Planning Layer:**
The foundation consists of tracking plan creation with events, event properties, user properties, and group properties (with Accounts add-on). This connects to Ampli Developer Tools for generating type-safe, autogenerated tracking libraries, and Visual Labeling for no-code event creation through DOM element selection with Autocapture. Property groups enable bulk management of event properties across multiple events, while CSV import/export functionality supports bulk tracking plan modifications.

**Data Management and Transformation Layer:**
Built on top of the planning layer, this includes derived properties using formulas with functions (REGEXEXTRACT, SPLIT, CONCAT, mathematical operations, date/time functions), Lookup Tables for enriching properties by importing CSV data sources (100MB/1M row limits), and transformations for retroactive data structure modifications. Custom events creation combines multiple existing events with OR clauses, while streaming transformations forward transformed events to destinations.

**Data Quality and Observability Layer:**
The Observe feature provides automatic event stream validation against tracking plans with status categorization (Unexpected, Valid, Invalid, Out of Date). The AI Data Assistant offers automated tracking plan optimization suggestions, while schema violation handling provides configurable responses. Drop filters enable query-time filtering and block filters provide ingestion-time blocking capabilities.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Data Concepts:**
- **Events**: User actions or occurrences tracked in the system
- **Event Properties**: Attributes specific to individual events at the time they occurred
- **User Properties**: Attributes of individual users that persist and update over time
- **Group Properties**: Properties associated with account-level entities (requires Accounts add-on)
- **Sources**: SDK or integration configurations within tracking plans

**Governance and Management:**
- **Tracking Plan**: Comprehensive schema defining all events, properties, and their specifications
- **Branches**: Feature development environments for tracking plan modifications
- **Property Groups**: Collections of event properties that can be applied to multiple events
- **Property Override**: Event-specific customization of shared property definitions
- **Schema Violations**: Instances where ingested data doesn't match tracking plan specifications

**Data Processing:**
- **Autocapture**: Automatic capture of user interactions (clicks, page views, form interactions) with minimal setup
- **Ampli**: Code generation tool creating type-safe SDK wrappers based on tracking plans
- **Derived Properties**: Computed properties created retroactively using formulas applied to existing data
- **Transformations**: Query-time modifications to event data structure without affecting raw data
- **Lookup Properties**: Enriched properties created by mapping ingested data to external CSV sources

**Access and Security:**
- **Data Access Control (DAC)**: Enterprise feature for managing access to sensitive data through property classification
- **Time-to-Live (TTL)**: Configurable data retention periods at organization and project levels
- **Role-based Permissions**: Admin/Manager/Member/Viewer access levels with specific capabilities

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Data serves as the foundational layer for the broader Amplitude ecosystem:

**Amplitude Analytics**: Direct project mapping and portfolio creation for cross-project analysis, with automatic schema syncing and metadata management.

**Amplitude Experiment**: SDK integration for A/B testing with consistent instrumentation through shared tracking plans.

**Data Infrastructure**: Deep integration with data warehouses (Snowflake, Databricks, S3) through Change Data Capture (CDC) for Profiles, Mirror Sync strategies for Data Mutability, and warehouse connections for Lookup Tables.

**Development Workflow**: Git-like branching model with Ampli CLI integration for seamless developer experience and CI/CD pipeline integration.

## API Endpoints and Technical Integration

**Core APIs:**
- **Taxonomy API**: CRUD operations for categories, event types, event properties, and user properties
- **HTTP V2 API**: Client-side event ingestion endpoint
- **Batch Event Upload API**: Server-side and historical data import with ingestion limits (500K events per device ID daily, 100 batches/1000 events per second)
- **Evaluation API**: Experiment feature flag evaluation

**Key CLI Commands:**
- `ampli pull`: Generate tracking library code from tracking plan
- `ampli status --is-merged`: Check if branch changes are merged to main

**Configuration Parameters:**
- `config.autocapture.elementInteractions`: Enable Visual Labeling (Browser SDK 2.10.0+)
- `fetchRemoteConfig`: Remote configuration merging for Autocapture settings
- `$skip_user_properties_sync`: Control user property synchronization during backfill
- `convertToAmplitudeFunc`: Data transformation rules for cloud storage imports

**Integration Capabilities:**
The platform includes a comprehensive source catalog supporting client-side SDKs (Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Unity, Flutter) and server-side SDKs (Node.js, Go, Python, Java). Destination event streaming provides real-time behavioral data forwarding with p95 latency of 60 seconds. Third-party integrations include Shopify Plugin, WordPress Plugin, and Jira integration, while cohort synchronization offers multiple cadence options (one-time, scheduled, real-time).

The Chrome Extension (Amplitude Instrumentation Explorer) provides real-time SDK debugging capabilities, completing the comprehensive toolkit for data lifecycle management from initial planning through implementation, monitoring, and optimization.
