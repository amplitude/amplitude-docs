# Amplitude Data: Comprehensive Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude Data is a comprehensive data governance platform that helps organizations define, track, verify, and improve the quality of their analytics data. It provides tools for planning and implementing data collection strategies, managing data quality, and transforming data to ensure accurate analytics. The platform serves as a central hub for creating and maintaining tracking plans, validating incoming data against defined schemas, and enriching data through various transformation capabilities.

Key features include:
- Data planning and instrumentation tools for creating structured tracking plans
- Type-safe SDK wrappers (Ampli) for implementing tracking plans with fewer errors
- Data validation and monitoring to ensure data quality
- Data transformation capabilities to correct and enhance data
- Integration with various platforms including Shopify, WordPress, and data warehouses
- Cross-project analysis for unified analytics across multiple products

## Product Relationships and Architecture

Amplitude Data functions as the foundation of the broader Amplitude analytics ecosystem, with several interconnected components:

1. **Data Planning Layer**:
   - Tracking Plans: Define events, properties, and sources in a centralized location
   - Ampli Developer Tools: Generate type-safe code based on tracking plans
   - Branching Workflow: Enable collaborative development of tracking plans

2. **Data Collection Layer**:
   - SDK Integration: Browser SDK, iOS Swift SDK, Android-Kotlin SDK
   - Autocapture: Automatic collection of user interactions
   - Server-side and Client-side tracking options
   - Plugins for platforms like Shopify and WordPress

3. **Data Management Layer**:
   - Schema Configuration: Handle unexpected data through violation settings
   - Transformations: Modify event data retroactively
   - Property Management: Create and manage event, user, and group properties
   - Data Access Control: Restrict access to sensitive data

4. **Data Enrichment Layer**:
   - Derived Properties: Create new properties using formulas
   - Lookup Tables: Map property values to additional data
   - Profiles: Join customer profile data from data warehouses
   - Channels: Create retroactive property classifications for marketing attribution

5. **Integration Layer**:
   - Event Streaming: Share behavioral data with external tools
   - Cohort Synchronization: Export user segments to third-party platforms
   - Jira Integration: Link tracking plan changes to development tasks

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Tracking Plan**: A specification that defines events, properties, and sources for data collection.

2. **Events**: User actions or system occurrences that are tracked. Categories include:
   - Active Events: Included in dashboard metrics and user counts
   - Inactive Events: Excluded from dashboard metrics but still count toward event volume
   - Custom Events: Combinations of multiple events using OR logic

3. **Properties**:
   - Event Properties: Attributes specific to an event occurrence
   - User Properties: Persistent attributes of users that persist across sessions
   - Group Properties: Attributes of organizational units users belong to

4. **Property Groups**: Collections of properties that can be applied to multiple events simultaneously.

5. **Ampli**: A lightweight wrapper for Amplitude SDKs that provides type-safe event tracking based on tracking plans.

6. **Autocapture**: Automatic collection of user interactions without manual instrumentation.

7. **Visual Labeling**: Interface for non-technical users to create labeled events by clicking elements on websites.

8. **Branches**: Isolated environments for making changes to tracking plans before merging to production.

9. **Schema Violations**: Unexpected data that doesn't match the tracking plan, including:
   - Unplanned event types
   - Unplanned properties
   - Unplanned property values

10. **Transformations**: Query-time modifications to event data that don't alter raw data.

11. **Data Access Control (DAC)**: Enterprise feature for restricting access to sensitive data.

12. **Time-to-Live (TTL)**: Feature controlling event data retention periods.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Data integrates with the broader Amplitude ecosystem and external tools:

1. **Within Amplitude**:
   - Amplitude Analytics: Data from tracking plans flows into analytics for analysis
   - Experiment: Uses properly structured data for experimentation
   - Session Replay: Captures user sessions for visual playback
   - Portfolios: Enable cross-project analysis across multiple source projects

2. **External Integrations**:
   - Data Warehouses: Snowflake, Databricks, and S3 for Profiles integration
   - Development Tools: Jira for linking tracking plan changes to development tasks
   - Marketing Platforms: Cohort synchronization with destinations like Braze, AppsFlyer
   - CMS Platforms: WordPress and Shopify plugins for easy implementation

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

1. **Batch Event Upload API**:
   - Used for data backfills and historical data imports
   - Throttling limit: 300 events per second per device ID
   - Daily limit: 500K events

2. **HTTP V2 API**:
   - Primary endpoint for server-side event tracking

3. **Taxonomy API**:
   - Enables programmatic management of taxonomy elements
   - Supports CRUD operations for categories, event types, and properties

4. **SDK Implementation Options**:
   - Client-side SDKs: Browser SDK, iOS Swift SDK, Android-Kotlin SDK
   - Server-side SDKs: Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Ruby
   - Configuration options:
     - `batchEvents`: Enable/disable event batching
     - `eventUploadThreshold`: Number of events to batch before sending
     - `trackingOptions`: Control IP address and location tracking

5. **Ampli CLI Commands**:
   - `ampli pull`: Pull tracking plan changes
   - `ampli status`: Check status of local tracking plan

6. **Data Transformation Operators**:
   - String operators: CONCAT, REPLACE, SUBSTRING
   - Math operators: ADD, SUBTRACT, MULTIPLY, DIVIDE
   - Date/time functions: NOW, DATE_PARSE, DATE_FORMAT
   - Conditional operators: IF, SWITCH, COALESCE
