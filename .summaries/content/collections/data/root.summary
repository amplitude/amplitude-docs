# Amplitude Data: Product Overview

Amplitude Data is a comprehensive data governance platform designed to help organizations manage the entire lifecycle of their analytics data. It provides tools for planning, instrumenting, managing, and monitoring data quality to ensure consistent analytics across an organization.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Data Planning and Instrumentation
- **Tracking Plans**: Centralized repository for defining, documenting, and managing events, properties, and data sources
- **Ampli Developer Tools**: Type-safe code generation that reduces implementation errors
- **Branching Workflow**: Git-like system for collaborative tracking plan management
- **Visual Labeling**: No-code event creation through clicking elements on websites with Autocapture enabled

### Data Collection Methods
- **Client-side Tracking**: Browser SDK for web applications, iOS Swift SDK, and Android-Kotlin SDK
- **Server-side Tracking**: Server SDKs and HTTP V2 API for backend event tracking
- **Autocapture**: Automatic collection of user interactions with minimal setup
- **Platform Plugins**: Pre-built integrations for WordPress, Shopify, and other platforms

### Data Management and Enrichment
- **Transformations**: Retroactive data modifications without changing code
- **Custom Events**: Combining multiple events with OR clauses
- **Derived Properties**: Creating new properties using formulas
- **Lookup Tables**: Enriching data by mapping property values to additional information
- **Channels**: Creating retroactive property classifications based on UTM and referrer data

### Data Quality and Governance
- **Schema Configuration**: Controls for handling unexpected data
- **Data Validation**: Real-time monitoring against tracking plans
- **AI Data Assistant**: Automated suggestions for tracking plan improvements
- **Data Access Control**: Restricting access to sensitive data
- **Time-to-Live (TTL)**: Configurable data retention periods

### Cross-Project and Integration Capabilities
- **Portfolios**: Combining multiple source projects for cross-product analysis
- **Event Streaming**: Sharing behavioral data with external tools
- **Cohort Synchronization**: Exporting user segments to third-party destinations

## Product Relationships and Ecosystem

Amplitude Data integrates with other Amplitude products:

1. **Amplitude Analytics**: Data collected through Amplitude Data powers analytics capabilities
2. **Amplitude Experiment**: Clean data structure enables more effective experimentation
3. **Session Replay**: Enhanced by proper instrumentation and Autocapture configuration

External system integrations include:
- **Data Warehouses**: Snowflake, Databricks, and S3 for Profiles feature
- **Marketing Platforms**: Event streaming to destinations like Braze and AppsFlyer
- **Development Tools**: Jira integration for tracking plan changes
- **CMS Platforms**: WordPress and Shopify plugins

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Events**: User actions or system occurrences tracked in Amplitude
- **Event Properties**: Attributes specific to an event occurrence
- **User Properties**: Attributes of users that persist across events
- **Group Properties**: Attributes of organizational units users belong to
- **Property Groups**: Collections of properties applicable to multiple events
- **Sources**: Origins of data (SDKs, APIs, integrations)
- **Tracking Plan**: Specification of expected events, properties, and metadata
- **Schema Violations**: Deviations from the defined tracking plan
