Amplitude Data is a comprehensive data governance and management platform that provides end-to-end control over analytics instrumentation, data quality, and taxonomy management. The platform serves as a centralized data catalog that enables teams to plan, implement, validate, and maintain consistent analytics tracking across their entire product ecosystem.

## Core Platform Components

**Tracking Plans and Schema Management**
Amplitude Data centers around tracking plans - structured schemas that define events, event properties, user properties, and group properties. These plans serve as the single source of truth for analytics implementation, supporting both proactive planning (defining events before implementation) and reactive management (organizing existing events). The platform uses a Git-like branching model where teams can create feature branches, make changes, publish versions, and merge back to main with team review workflows.

**Ampli Developer Toolkit**
The Ampli CLI generates type-safe, auto-generated tracking libraries from tracking plans, providing compile-time validation, autocompletion, and runtime checks. Developers use commands like `ampli pull` to generate code and `ampli status --is-merged` to verify implementation status. This bridges the gap between data planning and code implementation with strongly-typed wrappers around Amplitude SDKs.

**Data Ingestion and Sources**
The platform supports multiple ingestion methods including client-side SDKs (Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Unity, Flutter), server-side SDKs (Node.js, Go, Python, Java), and third-party integrations through the source catalog. Data flows through HTTP V2 API, Batch Event Upload API, and Evaluation API endpoints, with specific plugins for Shopify and WordPress that provide pre-configured tracking.

## Data Quality and Validation

**Schema Validation and Observability**
The Observe feature continuously monitors event streams against tracking plans, categorizing events as Valid, Invalid, Unexpected, or Out of Date. Schema violations can be configured to either "Mark As Unexpected" or "Reject" at ingestion time. The platform provides real-time validation with visual indicators, sparkline volume visualization, and environment-specific filtering.

**Autocapture and Visual Labeling**
Autocapture automatically tracks user interactions (Element Clicked, Element Changed, page views, sessions) with minimal setup across Browser SDK, iOS Swift SDK, and Android-Kotlin SDK. Visual Labeling extends this by allowing non-technical users to create labeled events by clicking DOM elements, requiring Browser SDK 2.10.0+ with `autocapture.elementInteractions` enabled.

## Data Transformation and Enhancement

**Derived Properties and Transformations**
Derived properties enable retroactive creation of new event and user properties using formulas with functions like `PROPERTY()`, `REGEXEXTRACT`, `SPLIT`, and `PARALLEL_PRODUCT`. Transformations allow query-time modification of event data structure to fix implementation mistakes through merging events/properties, renaming values, and hiding data without affecting raw data in warehouses.

**Lookup Tables and Property Groups**
Lookup Tables enrich events by importing CSV data sources (up to 100MB/1M rows) and mapping them to ingested properties with case-sensitive exact matching. Property Groups enable bulk management of event properties across multiple events, with automatic propagation of changes to all associated events.

## Advanced Features and Integrations

**Currency Conversion and Multi-Currency Support**
The platform provides OOTB derived properties (Currency Converted Revenue/Price) and `CURRENCY_CONVERT()` function using ISO 4217 currency codes with ExchangeRate API integration for daily exchange rate lookups, supporting multi-currency revenue analysis.

**Event Streaming and Destinations**
Destination event streaming enables real-time sharing of behavioral data to downstream tools with 60-second p95 latency targets, exponential backoff retry mechanisms, and configuration-based filtering. The platform supports streaming of transformed events including Custom Events, Derived Properties, and Transformed Properties.

**Cross-Project Analysis and Portfolios**
Portfolios combine up to 5 source projects for cross-project analysis with schema ranking for conflict resolution. The platform supports both Analytics-managed and Data-managed portfolios with automatic override creation for schema conflicts.

## Data Management and Governance

**Access Control and Privacy**
Data Access Control (DAC) manages access to sensitive data through property classification (PII, revenue, sensitive) and group-based permissions, including chart blocking, Event Stream restrictions, and export enforcement. The platform integrates with User Privacy API for GDPR/CCPA compliance.

**Data Retention and Mutability**
Time-to-Live (TTL) configures event data retention at organization and project levels with daily deletion jobs. Data Mutability enables INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations through Mirror Sync strategies across Snowflake (CDC), Databricks (CDF), and Amazon S3 integrations.

**Bot Traffic and Data Quality**
Block filters prevent bot traffic ingestion using IAB/ABC International Spiders and Bots List User-Agent detection, supporting legacy JavaScript SDK, TypeScript Browser SDK (v1.10.0+), and HTTP/Batch API implementations.

## Key APIs and Technical Integration

**Primary API Endpoints:**
- HTTP V2 API for client-side tracking
- Batch Event Upload API for server-side and historical data
- Evaluation API for experiment data
- Taxonomy API for CRUD operations on tracking plan objects
- User Privacy API for data deletion requests

**Development Tools:**
- Chrome Extension (Amplitude Instrumentation Explorer) for debugging
- CSV import/export for bulk tracking plan management  
- Jira integration for automatic issue creation on feature branch changes
- Git integration for version control workflows

The platform operates across different plan tiers (Starter/Plus vs Growth/Enterprise) with varying feature availability and limits, serving as the central nervous system for analytics data governance in modern product organizations.
