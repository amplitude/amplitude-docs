Amplitude Data is a comprehensive data governance and management platform that serves as the centralized control layer for analytics instrumentation across the entire data lifecycle. The platform enables organizations to create structured tracking plans, generate type-safe code, monitor data quality in real-time, and perform retroactive data transformations while maintaining data integrity.

## Product Architecture and Component Relationships

Amplitude Data functions as the governance backbone for Amplitude's analytics ecosystem, orchestrating multiple interconnected layers:

The **Data Ingestion Layer** supports both client-side SDKs (Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Unity, Flutter) and server-side SDKs (Node.js, Go, Python, Java) through HTTP V2 API and Batch Event Upload API endpoints. Third-party data flows through integrations with Segment, mParticle, and Tealium, plus specialized plugins for Shopify and WordPress platforms.

The **Ampli Developer Toolkit** generates type-safe tracking libraries from tracking plans, providing autocompletion and compile-time validation. This toolkit supports Git-like branching workflows with merge requests, team reviews, and version management through CLI commands like `ampli pull` and `ampli status --is-merged`.

The **Data Management Layer** encompasses streaming transformations, derived properties, lookup tables, custom events, and real-time monitoring through the Observe feature. All transformations apply retroactively without affecting raw warehouse data.

## Core Nomenclature and Definitions

**Tracking Plans** are structured schemas that define events, event properties, user properties, and groups with validation rules and data types (String, Number, Boolean, Array, Enum, Const, Any). These serve as the single source of truth for analytics implementation.

**Sources** represent SDK configurations within tracking plans that generate platform-specific instrumentation code through the Ampli CLI.

**Branches** provide development environments for tracking plan changes, enabling pending changes staging, team review workflows, and controlled merge operations back to the main branch.

**Schema Violations** encompass three categories of data quality issues: unplanned event types, unplanned properties, and unplanned property values, with configurable handling options to either mark as unexpected or reject entirely.

**Transformations** enable query-time data modifications including event/property merging, value renaming, and hiding, applied retroactively without affecting raw warehouse data.

**Property Groups** are reusable collections of event properties that can be bulk-applied to multiple events with automatic propagation of updates across implementations.

**Autocapture** provides automated tracking of user interactions (Element Clicked, Element Changed, Page Viewed, Session Start/End) with configurable allowlists and privacy controls.

## Data Processing and Quality Management

The platform enforces comprehensive data validation through schema enforcement, supporting ingestion limits of 500K events per device ID daily and 100 batches/1000 events per second. The Observe feature delivers real-time monitoring with event status classifications (Unexpected, Valid, Invalid, Out of Date) and automatic schema mismatch detection.

Data quality controls include block filters preventing bot traffic ingestion using IAB/ABC International Spiders and Bots List, drop filters for query-time data exclusion, and Time-to-Live (TTL) configuration for data retention management at organization and project levels.

## Enterprise Features and Advanced Capabilities

**Data Access Control (DAC)** provides enterprise-level property classification (PII, revenue, sensitive) with group-based permissions enforcement across charts, exports, and APIs.

**Derived Properties** enable formula-based property creation using functions like REGEXEXTRACT, SPLIT, DATE_TIME_FORMATTER, and PARALLEL_PRODUCT for retroactive data enrichment.

**Lookup Tables** support CSV-based data enrichment up to 100MB/1M rows with case-sensitive exact matching for property value transformation.

**Cross-Project Analysis** through the Portfolio feature combines up to 5 source projects with schema ranking for conflict resolution and metadata override management.

**Visual Labeling** offers a no-code event creation interface requiring Browser SDK 2.10.0+ with `config.autocapture.elementInteractions` enabled for non-technical users.

## Integration and Streaming Architecture

The platform supports destination event streaming with p95 latency targets of 60 seconds, exponential backoff retry mechanisms, and real-time behavioral data forwarding to marketing and infrastructure tools. Cohort synchronization offers three cadence options: one-time, scheduled (hourly/daily), and real-time (every minute) syncing.

API access includes the Taxonomy API for CRUD operations on categories, event types, and properties, with restrictions limiting edits to planned events without existing project data. The Chrome extension (Event Explorer/Instrumentation Explorer) provides real-time debugging capabilities for JS SDK instrumentation.

## Broader Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Data integrates with data warehouses through Amplitude Profiles using Change Data Capture (CDC) with support for Snowflake, Databricks, and S3. This enables incremental modeling with mutation_type operations (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) for customer profile data synchronization, creating a unified view across the entire customer data platform while maintaining data lineage and governance standards throughout the analytics ecosystem.
