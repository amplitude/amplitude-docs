Amplitude Data is a comprehensive data governance and management platform that serves as the centralized control layer for analytics instrumentation across the entire data lifecycle. The platform enables organizations to create structured tracking plans, generate type-safe code, monitor data quality in real-time, and transform data for analysis while maintaining strict governance standards.

## Core Product Architecture

Amplitude Data functions as the governance backbone for Amplitude's analytics ecosystem, integrating seamlessly with multiple components:

- **Amplitude Analytics**: The primary analytics platform where Data-managed tracking plans and schemas are enforced
- **Amplitude SDKs**: Comprehensive client-side (Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Unity, Flutter) and server-side (Node.js, Python, Java, Go) SDKs that implement tracking plans
- **Ampli Developer Tools**: Advanced code generation toolkit that creates type-safe wrappers based on tracking plans
- **Third-party Integrations**: Extensive source catalog for data ingestion and destination catalog for real-time event streaming

## Key Features and Capabilities

### Data Planning and Schema Management
The platform's foundation rests on **tracking plans** - sophisticated schemas that define events, event properties, user properties, and groups with precise specifications. Users develop tracking plans through a Git-like branch-based workflow that enables collaborative development with merge requests, team reviews, and comprehensive version management. The system supports **property groups** for efficient bulk management of related properties across multiple events, streamlining schema maintenance.

### Code Generation and Implementation
**Ampli** serves as the primary developer toolkit, automatically generating type-safe tracking libraries from tracking plans. Key commands include `ampli pull` for syncing tracking plans with local development environments and `ampli status --is-merged` for validating implementation status against published plans. This approach ensures compile-time validation, IDE autocompletion, and eliminates runtime tracking errors.

### Data Quality and Observability
The **Observe feature** provides comprehensive real-time monitoring of event streams against tracking plans, automatically surfacing data quality issues including schema violations, missing properties, and incorrect data types. The platform categorizes all events as Valid, Invalid, Unexpected, or Out of Date, enabling proactive data quality management and immediate issue resolution.

### Data Transformation and Enhancement
Amplitude Data offers sophisticated transformation capabilities:
- **Derived Properties**: Enterprise-level computed properties using advanced formulas and functions
- **Custom Events**: Complex event combinations using OR clauses for nuanced analysis
- **Transformations**: Retroactive event structure modifications through merging, renaming, and hiding operations
- **Lookup Tables**: CSV-based property enrichment with external data sources for enhanced context

### Advanced Data Management
- **Profiles**: Deep integration with data warehouses (Snowflake, Databricks, S3) using Change Data Capture (CDC) for real-time customer profile synchronization
- **Data Mutability**: Full support for INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations through configurable Mirror Sync strategies
- **Time-to-Live (TTL)**: Granular data retention policies configurable at organization and project levels

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Tracking Plan**: The central schema definition containing comprehensive event specifications, properties, and their relationships
**Sources**: SDK configurations within tracking plans that define data collection methodologies and parameters
**Branches**: Development environments for tracking plan changes, mirroring Git-style version control workflows
**Property Groups**: Curated collections of related properties that can be efficiently applied across multiple events
**Schema Violations**: Systematic discrepancies between ingested data and tracking plan definitions, automatically categorized as "unexpected" or "rejected"
**Ampli**: The sophisticated code generation tool that creates type-safe SDK wrappers with full IDE integration
**Autocapture**: Intelligent automatic collection of user interactions without manual instrumentation requirements
**Visual Labeling**: No-code interface enabling event creation through direct website element interaction

## Data Ingestion and Processing

The platform supports multiple sophisticated ingestion methods:
- **Client-side SDKs** optimized for browser and mobile applications with offline support
- **Server-side SDKs** designed for high-throughput backend event tracking
- **HTTP V2 API** and **Batch Event Upload API** for direct system integration with rate limiting
- **Third-party sources** through an extensive, configurable source catalog

Data processing includes automatic enrichment with precise location data via MaxMind GeoIP, comprehensive user agent parsing for detailed device information, and configurable schema validation with granular options to mark violations as unexpected or reject them entirely based on business requirements.

## Integration Ecosystem

### Source Integrations
The comprehensive source catalog enables seamless data ingestion from numerous platforms, featuring sophisticated converter configurations for transforming external data formats into Amplitude events using the flexible `convertToAmplitudeFunc` structure with custom mapping capabilities.

### Destination Streaming
Advanced event streaming capabilities provide real-time forwarding of behavioral data to downstream tools with stringent p95 latency targets of 60 seconds. The platform supports flexible cohort synchronization with multiple cadences (one-time, scheduled, real-time) and streaming transformations for pre-processed data delivery.

### Developer Tools Integration
- **Chrome Extension** (Event Explorer/Instrumentation Explorer) for comprehensive real-time debugging and validation
- **Jira Integration** for automated issue creation and tracking during tracking plan changes
- **CSV Import/Export** for efficient bulk tracking plan management and migration

## Access Control and Governance

**Data Access Control (DAC)** provides Enterprise-level security through sophisticated property classification systems (PII, revenue, sensitive) and granular group-based permissions. The platform enforces comprehensive restrictions across charts, exports, and API access while maintaining strict data governance standards and compliance requirements.

## API Endpoints and Commands

Critical API endpoints include:
- **Taxonomy API**: Full CRUD operations for events, properties, and categories with versioning
- **HTTP V2 API**: High-performance real-time event ingestion with batching support
- **Batch Event Upload API**: Historical data backfill capabilities with 500K events per device ID daily limits

Essential CLI commands:
- `ampli pull`: Synchronize tracking plan to local development environment with conflict resolution
- `ampli status --is-merged`: Comprehensive validation of implementation against published tracking plan

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Data operates as the central nervous system within the broader Amplitude ecosystem, providing the foundational data governance layer that ensures consistency across Analytics, Experiment, and other Amplitude products. The platform's tracking plans serve as the single source of truth for event definitions, enabling seamless data flow between products while maintaining data quality and governance standards.

The platform operates on a sophisticated freemium model with distinct feature tiers (Starter/Plus/Growth/Enterprise) that provide graduated access to advanced capabilities including derived properties, cross-project analysis portfolios, advanced governance features, and enterprise-grade security controls. This tiered approach enables organizations to scale their data governance capabilities as their analytics maturity and requirements evolve.
