# Summary
This documentation page explains how to synchronize Amplitude cohorts with third-party destinations using three sync methods: one-time sync (single export), scheduled sync (hourly/daily updates with automatic timing), and real-time sync (minute-by-minute updates with limitations on cohort size, types, and supported destinations).
