**Summary:** Amplitude Data's Observe feature automatically monitors event tracking by analyzing the existing event stream without code changes, validating events against tracking plans and categorizing them with statuses (Unexpected, Valid, Invalid, Out of Date) while providing insights into missing properties, data type mismatches, and source attribution across different environments and SDK implementations.
