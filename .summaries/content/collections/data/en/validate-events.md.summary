# Summary
Amplitude Data's Observe feature automatically monitors event tracking without code changes, comparing incoming events against tracking plans to identify unexpected, valid, invalid, or out-of-date events and properties. It provides real-time validation across platforms, allowing teams to overlay tracking plans with event streams from specific environments and time ranges to maintain data quality.
