**Summary:** This documentation explains the differences between user properties (attributes of individual users like device type, location, User ID) and event properties (attributes of specific events at the time they occurred) in Amplitude, covering how user properties update over time, persist across events, and can create overlapping values when changed, plus how to hide properties and automatic 14-month deletion policies.
