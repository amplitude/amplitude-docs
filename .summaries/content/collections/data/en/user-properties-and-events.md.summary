**Summary:** This documentation explains the differences between user properties (attributes of individual users like device type, location, User ID) and event properties (attributes of specific events at the time they occurred) in Amplitude, covering how user properties update over time, persist across events, and can be applied through Identify API calls, while event properties are tied to specific event instances.
