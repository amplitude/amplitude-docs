## Summary
Amplitude's destination event streaming enables sharing behavioral data with external tools, offering configuration-based controls to filter data by user, group, and event properties, with monitoring capabilities for event volume, latency, and delivery status. The service maintains billing efficiency by counting distinct events once regardless of destination count, targets 60-second latency, and implements a robust retry mechanism for failed deliveries.
