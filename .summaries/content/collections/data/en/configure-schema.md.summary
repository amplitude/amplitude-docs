# Summary
This documentation explains how to configure Amplitude's schema settings to handle unexpected data through three violation types: unplanned event types, unplanned properties, and unplanned property values. Each can be configured to either "Mark as Unexpected" (ingest with warnings) or "Reject" (discard with notifications).
