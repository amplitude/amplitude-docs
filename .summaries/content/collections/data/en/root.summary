# Amplitude Data: Comprehensive Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude Data is a comprehensive data governance platform that helps organizations define, track, verify, and improve the quality of their analytics data. The platform consists of two main components: data planning tools to prevent issues upfront, and data management tools to handle ingested data. Amplitude Data enables teams to create structured tracking plans, implement instrumentation with type-safe code, validate incoming data against plans, and transform or enrich data as needed.

Key features include:
- Tracking plan creation and management
- Ampli developer toolkit for type-safe implementation
- Data validation and observability
- Data transformation and enrichment capabilities
- Integration with various data sources and destinations
- Collaborative workflows with branching and review processes
- AI-powered data assistant for maintenance suggestions

## Product Relationships and Architecture

Amplitude Data functions as the governance layer within the broader Amplitude Analytics ecosystem:

1. **Data Collection Layer**: 
   - Client-side SDKs (Browser, iOS Swift, Android-Kotlin)
   - Server-side SDKs
   - HTTP APIs (V2 API, Batch Event Upload)
   - Third-party integrations (Shopify, WordPress)

2. **Data Governance Layer** (Amplitude Data):
   - Planning tools (Tracking Plans, Ampli)
   - Management tools (Transformations, Derived Properties, Lookup Tables)
   - Validation tools (Observe, Schema Configuration)
   - Enrichment tools (Profiles, Channels)

3. **Analytics Layer**:
   - Amplitude Analytics (charts, dashboards, cohorts)
   - Cross-project analysis via Portfolios

4. **Integration Layer**:
   - Event streaming to destinations
   - Cohort synchronization
   - Jira integration for workflow management

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Data Collection Concepts
- **Client-side tracking**: Instrumentation that runs on user devices (mobile apps, browsers)
- **Server-side tracking**: Instrumentation that runs on backend servers
- **Autocapture**: Automatic collection of user interactions without manual instrumentation
- **Visual Labeling**: No-code interface for creating labeled events from Autocapture data

### Data Structure Concepts
- **Events**: User actions or system occurrences tracked in Amplitude
- **Event properties**: Attributes specific to individual event occurrences
- **User properties**: Persistent attributes associated with users
- **Group properties**: Attributes associated with organizational groupings
- **Property groups**: Collections of properties that can be applied to multiple events

### Data Management Concepts
- **Tracking plan**: Structured documentation of events, properties, and sources
- **Sources**: Origins of data (SDKs, APIs, integrations)
- **Schema violations**: Unexpected events or properties not defined in tracking plans
- **Transformations**: Query-time modifications to correct implementation issues
- **Derived properties**: New properties created from existing ones using formulas
- **Lookup tables**: External data imported to enrich existing properties
- **Profiles**: User attributes imported from data warehouses
- **Channels**: Retroactive property classifications for marketing attribution

### Workflow Concepts
- **Branches**: Isolated environments for making tracking plan changes
- **Merge requests**: Process for reviewing and incorporating branch changes
- **Environments**: Separate contexts (development, production) for testing

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Data integrates with:

1. **Development Workflows**:
   - Ampli CLI generates type-safe code from tracking plans
   - Integration with Jira for issue tracking
   - Chrome extension for debugging instrumentation

2. **Data Sources**:
   - Native SDKs for web, mobile, and server implementations
   - Third-party platforms (Shopify, WordPress)
   - Data warehouses (Snowflake, Databricks, S3) for Profiles

3. **Downstream Destinations**:
   - Event streaming to marketing, analytics, and data platforms
   - Cohort synchronization with third-party tools
   - Streaming transformations to external systems

4. **Internal Amplitude Products**:
   - Amplitude Analytics for visualization and analysis
   - Cross-project analysis through Portfolios
   - Session Replay for visual context

## API Endpoints and CLI Commands

### Ampli CLI Commands
- `ampli pull`: Fetches the latest tracking plan
- `ampli status`: Shows tracking plan implementation status
- `ampli generate`: Creates type-safe tracking libraries

### API Endpoints
- **HTTP V2 API**: `/2/httpapi` for event ingestion
- **Batch Event Upload API**: `/batch` for historical data backfills
- **Taxonomy API**: Programmatic management of data taxonomy
- **User Privacy API**: For data deletion requests

### SDK Configuration Options
- `batchEvents`: Controls event batching
- `eventUploadThreshold`: Sets batch size
- `eventUploadPeriodMillis`: Sets upload frequency
- `cssSelectorAllowlist`: Limits Autocapture to specific elements
- `pageUrlAllowlist`: Restricts Autocapture to specific pages
- `$skip_user_properties_sync`: Prevents overwriting current user properties during backfills

Amplitude Data provides a comprehensive solution for organizations to establish data governance practices, maintain high-quality analytics data, and ensure consistent implementation across teams and platforms.
