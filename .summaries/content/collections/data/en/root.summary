Amplitude Data is a comprehensive data governance and management platform that provides tools for planning, implementing, and managing event tracking across digital products. The platform serves as a centralized data catalog that enables organizations to maintain data quality, consistency, and governance throughout their analytics implementation.

## Core Product Features and Capabilities

**Data Planning and Instrumentation**
Amplitude Data centers around tracking plans - structured schemas that define events, event properties, user properties, and groups. The platform supports a complete planning workflow using branches for version control, allowing teams to create, review, and merge changes collaboratively. The Ampli developer toolkit generates type-safe, auto-generated code from tracking plans, providing compile-time validation and autocompletion for developers implementing event tracking.

**Data Management and Transformation**
The platform offers extensive data transformation capabilities including derived properties (computed retroactively using formulas), custom events (combining multiple events with OR clauses), lookup tables for property enrichment via CSV imports, and streaming transformations. These features enable retroactive data structure modifications without affecting raw data storage.

**Data Quality and Observability**
Real-time data observability through the Observe feature automatically monitors event streams, validating against tracking plans and categorizing events as Valid, Invalid, Unexpected, or Out of Date. The AI Data Assistant provides automated suggestions for tracking plan improvements based on event volume and query patterns.

**Autocapture and Visual Labeling**
Advanced autocapture functionality automatically tracks user interactions (clicks, page views, form interactions) across Browser SDK, iOS Swift SDK, and Android-Kotlin SDK with minimal setup. Visual Labeling enables non-technical users to create labeled events by clicking website elements without code changes.

## Product Relationships and Integration Architecture

**SDK Integration Ecosystem**
Amplitude Data integrates with both client-side SDKs (Browser, Android, iOS, Unity, Flutter, React Native) and server-side SDKs (Node.js, Go, Python, Java) through corresponding API endpoints including HTTP V2 API, Batch Event Upload API, and Evaluation API. The platform also supports third-party source integrations through Segment, mParticle, and Tealium.

**Platform Integrations**
Pre-built plugins exist for Shopify and WordPress, automatically implementing Browser SDK with Session Replay and Web Experiment capabilities. The Shopify plugin handles commerce-specific events like checkout tracking and product views, while the WordPress plugin provides advanced autocapture functionality.

**Data Warehouse and Cloud Storage**
The platform supports data ingestion from Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Snowflake, and Databricks through configurable converters using the `convertToAmplitudeFunc` transformation system. Data Mutability features enable INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations through Mirror Sync strategies with Change Data Capture (CDC) and Change Data Feed (CDF) capabilities.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Data Concepts**
- **Events**: Actions users take in products, following noun + past tense verb naming conventions
- **Event Properties**: Attributes describing specific event instances at occurrence time
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes of individual users that update over time
- **Groups**: Account-level entities for B2B analytics with group properties
- **Sources**: SDK implementations or data ingestion points in tracking plans

**Data Management Terms**
- **Tracking Plans**: Structured schemas defining expected events and properties
- **Branches**: Version control system for tracking plan changes with main branch workflow
- **Derived Properties**: Computed properties using formulas applied retroactively to existing data
- **Custom Events**: Combined events using OR clauses across multiple existing events
- **Transformations**: Query-time modifications for retroactive data structure changes
- **Schema Violations**: Unplanned events, properties, or property values not in tracking plans

**Data Quality Classifications**
- **Valid Events**: Match tracking plan specifications exactly
- **Invalid Events**: Present in tracking plan but with data type mismatches or missing required properties
- **Unexpected Events**: Not defined in tracking plan but appearing in data stream
- **Out of Date Events**: Tracking plan definitions newer than implementation

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

**Analytics Platform Connection**
Amplitude Data serves as the governance layer for Amplitude Analytics, with tracking plans syncing to Analytics projects through environment mappings. Cross-project analysis capabilities through portfolios enable combining up to 5 source projects with schema ranking for conflict resolution.

**Destination Event Streaming**
Real-time behavioral data forwarding to downstream marketing, sales, and infrastructure tools with 60-second p95 latency targets. Cohort synchronization supports one-time, scheduled (hourly/daily), and real-time (minute-by-minute) syncing to third-party destinations including ad networks and marketing automation platforms.

**Enterprise Governance Features**
Data Access Control (DAC) enables property classification as PII, revenue, or sensitive data with group-based permissions. Object Management provides centralized control over reusable analysis objects including custom events, metrics, segments, and cohorts. Time-to-Live (TTL) configuration manages data retention periods at organization and project levels.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Primary APIs**
- **Taxonomy API**: CRUD operations for categories, event types, event properties, and user properties
- **HTTP V2 API**: Client-side event ingestion endpoint
- **Batch Event Upload API**: Server-side and historical data backfill with 500K events per device ID daily limits
- **Evaluation API**: Experiment feature flag evaluation

**Command Line Tools**
- **Ampli CLI**: `ampli pull` for code generation, `ampli status --is-merged` for branch validation
- **Chrome Extension**: Amplitude Instrumentation Explorer for real-time SDK debugging

**Configuration Parameters**
Key SDK configuration options include `batchEvents`, `sessionTimeout`, `minTimeBetweenSessions`, `eventUploadThreshold`, `cssSelectorAllowlist`, `pageUrlAllowlist`, and `trackingOptions` for controlling data collection behavior.

The platform supports advanced features like currency conversion using the `CURRENCY_CONVERT` function with ISO 4217 currency codes, IP address and location processing through MaxMind database integration, and comprehensive data filtering through drop filters (query-time) and block filters (ingestion-time) for data quality management.
