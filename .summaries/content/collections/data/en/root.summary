Amplitude Data is a comprehensive data governance and management platform that provides tools for planning, implementing, and maintaining analytics instrumentation across the entire data lifecycle. The platform serves as a centralized data catalog that enables organizations to create structured tracking plans, generate type-safe code, monitor data quality, and transform data retroactively.

## Core Product Architecture and Features

**Data Planning and Instrumentation**
Amplitude Data centers around tracking plans - structured schemas that define events, event properties, user properties, and groups. The platform supports a Git-like branching workflow where teams can create feature branches, make changes collaboratively, and merge back to main after stakeholder reviews. The Ampli Developer Tools generate type-safe tracking libraries from these plans, providing autocompletion and compile-time validation for multiple SDKs including Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Unity, Flutter, Node.js, Go, Python, and Java.

**Data Ingestion and Sources**
The platform supports both client-side SDKs (Browser, mobile, gaming platforms) and server-side SDKs, along with third-party integrations through the source catalog. Data can be ingested via HTTP V2 API, Batch Event Upload API, and various cloud storage solutions (Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Snowflake, Databricks). The system includes specialized plugins for Shopify and WordPress that automatically implement Browser SDK with Session Replay and Autocapture capabilities.

**Data Quality and Observability**
Amplitude Data provides comprehensive monitoring through its Observe feature, which validates incoming events against tracking plans in real-time. The platform identifies schema violations including unplanned events, properties, and values, with configurable responses to either mark data as unexpected or reject it entirely. The AI Data Assistant automatically generates prioritized suggestions for tracking plan improvements based on event volume and query patterns.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events and Properties**
- **Events**: User actions or occurrences tracked in the system (e.g., "Product Viewed", "Cart Added")
- **Event Properties**: Attributes specific to individual event instances (e.g., product_id, price)
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes of users that update over time (e.g., subscription_status, device_type)
- **Group Properties**: Attributes of account-level entities when using the Accounts add-on

**Data Management Concepts**
- **Tracking Plan**: The structured schema defining all events and properties for a project
- **Sources**: SDK implementations or third-party integrations sending data to Amplitude
- **Autocapture**: Automatic collection of user interactions (clicks, page views, form submissions) with minimal setup
- **Visual Labeling**: No-code interface for creating labeled events by clicking website elements
- **Property Groups**: Collections of event properties that can be applied to multiple events simultaneously

**Data Transformation and Enhancement**
- **Custom Events**: Combinations of existing events using OR clauses for related activity tracking
- **Derived Properties**: Retroactively created properties using formulas applied to existing data
- **Lookup Tables**: CSV-based property enrichment through external data mapping
- **Transformations**: Query-time modifications to fix implementation issues without affecting raw data
- **Channels**: Retroactive property classifiers based on UTM and referrer data for attribution

## Product Ecosystem Integration

**Analytics Integration**
Amplitude Data serves as the foundation for Amplitude Analytics, providing the schema and data quality layer. Tracking plans created in Data directly populate the Analytics interface, while custom events, derived properties, and transformations enhance analysis capabilities. The platform supports cross-project analysis through portfolios that combine up to 5 source projects with schema ranking for conflict resolution.

**Experiment Platform**
The platform integrates with Amplitude Experiment through both client-side and server-side SDKs, with the Evaluation API enabling feature flag and experiment management. The Shopify plugin includes Web Experiment capabilities with anti-flicker implementation.

**Data Infrastructure**
Amplitude Data connects to modern data stacks through warehouse integrations supporting Change Data Capture (CDC) and Change Data Feed (CDF) for real-time synchronization. The platform supports data mutability operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) across Snowflake, Databricks, and Amazon S3, with Mirror Sync strategies for maintaining data consistency.

**Third-Party Ecosystem**
The destination catalog enables real-time event streaming to marketing, sales, and infrastructure tools with p95 latency targets of 60 seconds. Cohort synchronization supports one-time, scheduled, and real-time syncing to ad networks and marketing platforms. The platform includes specialized integrations for Jira (automatic issue creation), and supports various authentication flows.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Core APIs**
- **HTTP V2 API**: Primary endpoint for real-time event ingestion
- **Batch Event Upload API**: Bulk data import with 500K events per device ID daily limits
- **Taxonomy API**: CRUD operations for categories, event types, and properties
- **Evaluation API**: Server-side experiment and feature flag evaluation

**CLI Tools**
- **Ampli CLI**: Code generation and tracking plan synchronization
  - `ampli pull`: Download latest tracking plan changes
  - `ampli status --is-merged`: Check branch merge status

**Configuration Options**
Key SDK configuration parameters include `batchEvents`, `eventUploadThreshold`, `sessionTimeout`, `minTimeBetweenSessions`, `optOut`, `saveEvents`, and `trackingOptions` for controlling data collection behavior.

**Data Access and Security**
Enterprise organizations can implement Data Access Control (DAC) to classify properties as PII, revenue, or sensitive data with group-based permissions. The platform enforces restrictions across charts, cohorts, exports, and the Taxonomy API, displaying `[DAC Restricted]` for unauthorized access attempts.

The platform supports comprehensive data lifecycle management including Time-to-Live (TTL) configuration for data retention, User Privacy API for GDPR/CCPA compliance, and various filtering mechanisms (drop filters, block filters) for data quality control.
