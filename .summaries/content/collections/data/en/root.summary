Amplitude Data is a comprehensive data governance and management platform that provides tools for planning, implementing, and maintaining analytics instrumentation across the entire data lifecycle. The platform serves as a centralized data catalog that enables organizations to create structured tracking plans, generate type-safe code, monitor data quality, and transform data for analysis.

## Core Product Architecture

Amplitude Data operates as the governance layer for Amplitude's analytics ecosystem, integrating with multiple components:

- **Amplitude Analytics**: The core analytics platform where Data-managed tracking plans and schemas are applied
- **Amplitude SDKs**: Client-side (Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Unity, Flutter) and server-side (Node.js, Python, Java, Go) SDKs that implement tracking plans
- **Ampli Developer Tools**: Code generation toolkit that creates type-safe wrappers based on tracking plans
- **Third-party Integrations**: Source catalog for data ingestion and destination catalog for event streaming

## Key Features and Capabilities

### Data Planning and Schema Management
The platform centers around **tracking plans** - structured schemas that define events, event properties, user properties, and groups. Users can create tracking plans through a branch-based workflow similar to Git, enabling collaborative development with features like merge requests, team reviews, and version management. The system supports **property groups** for bulk management of related properties across multiple events.

### Code Generation and Implementation
**Ampli** serves as the primary developer tool, generating type-safe tracking libraries from tracking plans. The `ampli pull` and `ampli status --is-merged` commands enable developers to sync tracking plans with their codebase and validate implementation status. This ensures compile-time validation and autocompletion for event tracking.

### Data Quality and Observability
The **Observe feature** provides real-time monitoring of event streams against tracking plans, surfacing data quality issues like schema violations, missing properties, and incorrect data types. The platform categorizes events as Valid, Invalid, Unexpected, or Out of Date, enabling proactive data quality management.

### Data Transformation and Enhancement
Amplitude Data offers several transformation capabilities:
- **Derived Properties**: Enterprise-level feature for creating computed properties using formulas and functions
- **Custom Events**: Combining multiple events with OR clauses for analysis
- **Transformations**: Retroactive modification of event structure through merging, renaming, and hiding operations
- **Lookup Tables**: CSV-based property enrichment with external data sources

### Advanced Data Management
- **Profiles**: Integration with data warehouses (Snowflake, Databricks, S3) using Change Data Capture (CDC) for customer profile synchronization
- **Data Mutability**: Support for INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations through Mirror Sync strategies
- **Time-to-Live (TTL)**: Configurable data retention policies at organization and project levels

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Tracking Plan**: The central schema definition containing events, properties, and their relationships
**Sources**: SDK configurations within tracking plans that define how data is collected
**Branches**: Development environments for tracking plan changes, similar to Git branches
**Property Groups**: Collections of related properties that can be applied to multiple events
**Schema Violations**: Discrepancies between ingested data and tracking plan definitions, handled as "unexpected" or "rejected"
**Ampli**: The code generation tool that creates type-safe SDK wrappers
**Autocapture**: Automatic collection of user interactions without manual instrumentation
**Visual Labeling**: No-code interface for creating events by clicking website elements

## Data Ingestion and Processing

The platform supports multiple ingestion methods:
- **Client-side SDKs** for browser and mobile applications
- **Server-side SDKs** for backend event tracking  
- **HTTP V2 API** and **Batch Event Upload API** for direct integration
- **Third-party sources** through the source catalog

Data processing includes automatic enrichment with location data via MaxMind GeoIP, user agent parsing for device information, and configurable schema validation with options to mark violations as unexpected or reject them entirely.

## Integration Ecosystem

### Source Integrations
The source catalog enables data ingestion from various platforms, with converter configurations for transforming external data formats into Amplitude events using the `convertToAmplitudeFunc` structure.

### Destination Streaming
Event streaming capabilities allow real-time forwarding of behavioral data to downstream tools with p95 latency targets of 60 seconds. The platform supports cohort synchronization with various cadences (one-time, scheduled, real-time) and streaming transformations for pre-processed data.

### Developer Tools Integration
- **Chrome Extension** (Event Explorer/Instrumentation Explorer) for real-time debugging
- **Jira Integration** for automatic issue creation during tracking plan changes
- **CSV Import/Export** for bulk tracking plan management

## Access Control and Governance

**Data Access Control (DAC)** provides Enterprise-level security through property classification (PII, revenue, sensitive) and group-based permissions. The platform enforces restrictions across charts, exports, and API access while maintaining data governance standards.

## API Endpoints and Commands

Key API endpoints include:
- **Taxonomy API**: CRUD operations for events, properties, and categories
- **HTTP V2 API**: Real-time event ingestion
- **Batch Event Upload API**: Historical data backfill with 500K events per device ID daily limits

Primary CLI commands:
- `ampli pull`: Sync tracking plan to local development environment
- `ampli status --is-merged`: Validate implementation against published tracking plan

The platform operates on a freemium model with feature tiers (Starter/Plus/Growth/Enterprise) that determine access to advanced capabilities like derived properties, cross-project analysis portfolios, and enterprise governance features.
