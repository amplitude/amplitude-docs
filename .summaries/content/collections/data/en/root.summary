Amplitude Data is a comprehensive data governance and management platform that provides tools for planning, implementing, and managing analytics instrumentation across the entire data lifecycle. The platform serves as a centralized data catalog that enables organizations to create structured tracking plans, generate type-safe code, and maintain data quality through automated monitoring and validation.

## Core Product Architecture

Amplitude Data operates as the governance layer for Amplitude's analytics ecosystem, built around several interconnected components:

**Tracking Plans and Schema Management**: The foundation of Amplitude Data is the tracking plan system, which allows teams to define events, event properties, user properties, and group properties in a structured schema. These tracking plans support branching workflows similar to Git, enabling collaborative development with features like merge requests, team reviews, and version management.

**Ampli Developer Tools**: The platform generates type-safe tracking libraries through the Ampli CLI (`ampli pull`, `ampli status --is-merged`) that provide autocompletion and compile-time validation for event tracking across multiple SDKs and programming languages.

**Data Transformation and Enrichment**: Amplitude Data provides multiple layers of data enhancement including derived properties (using functions like REGEXEXTRACT, SPLIT, CONCAT), lookup tables for CSV-based property enrichment, custom events with OR clause logic, and streaming transformations for real-time data processing.

**Observability and Validation**: The platform includes comprehensive monitoring through the Observe feature, which automatically validates events against tracking plans and categorizes them with statuses (Unexpected, Valid, Invalid, Out of Date), plus AI-powered Data Assistant for automated tracking plan optimization.

## Key Features and Capabilities

**Multi-Environment Support**: The platform supports environment-specific configurations with legacy environment settings that map production/development environments to specific Amplitude Analytics projects, plus modern branch-based workflows for testing and deployment.

**Data Ingestion Methods**: Amplitude Data supports multiple ingestion pathways including client-side SDKs (Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Unity, Flutter), server-side SDKs (Node.js, Go, Python, Java), HTTP V2 API, Batch Event Upload API, and third-party integrations through the source catalog.

**Advanced Data Management**: The platform provides sophisticated data handling through features like Data Mutability (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations via Mirror Sync strategies), Time-to-Live (TTL) configuration for data retention, and comprehensive data access control (DAC) for Enterprise organizations with PII/sensitive data classification.

**Real-time Streaming and Destinations**: Destination event streaming enables real-time behavioral data forwarding to downstream tools with p95 latency targets of 60 seconds, exponential backoff retry mechanisms, and integration with marketing platforms like Braze and Iterable.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events vs Properties**: Events represent user actions or system occurrences, while properties are attributes that describe either the event itself (event properties) or the user performing the action (user properties). Group properties enable account-level reporting through the Groups framework.

**Schema Violations**: The platform handles three types of schema violations - unplanned event types, unplanned event/user properties, and unplanned property values - with configurable responses to either mark as unexpected or reject the data.

**Autocapture**: Automated event collection that captures user interactions (Element Clicked, Element Changed, page views, sessions, form interactions) with minimal setup across Browser SDK, iOS Swift SDK, and Android-Kotlin SDK implementations.

**Visual Labeling**: No-code event creation through Amplitude Data's visual interface by clicking DOM elements on websites with Autocapture enabled, requiring Browser SDK 2.10.0+ with specific configuration settings.

**Property Groups**: Bulk management system for event properties that allows grouping properties for application to multiple events with automatic propagation of updates across associated events in tracking plans.

## Integration Ecosystem

Amplitude Data integrates extensively with the broader Amplitude ecosystem and external tools:

**Analytics Integration**: Deep integration with Amplitude Analytics through portfolios for cross-project analysis (combining up to 5 source projects), custom events for Event Segmentation and Funnel Analysis, and channels for retroactive UTM/referrer-based attribution modeling.

**Warehouse Connections**: Native integrations with Snowflake (CDC), Databricks (CDF), and Amazon S3 for data warehouse synchronization, including Profiles feature for joining customer profile data with behavioral data using Change Data Capture.

**Developer Tools**: Chrome extension (Event Explorer/Instrumentation Explorer) for real-time SDK debugging, Jira integration for automatic issue creation on feature branch changes, and comprehensive API access through the Taxonomy API for CRUD operations.

**Third-party Platforms**: Extensive integration catalog including Shopify Plugin (automatic e-commerce event tracking), WordPress Plugin (advanced Autocapture), and cohort synchronization with destinations supporting one-time, scheduled, and real-time sync cadences.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Core APIs**: HTTP V2 API for real-time event ingestion, Batch Event Upload API for historical data backfill (500K events per device ID daily limit), Evaluation API for experiment tracking, and Taxonomy API for programmatic schema management.

**Configuration Options**: SDK configuration includes parameters like `batchEvents`, `eventUploadThreshold`, `sessionTimeout`, `minTimeBetweenSessions`, `optOut`, `savedMaxCount`, and tracking options for IP address and location handling.

**Data Processing**: The platform uses MaxMind database for GeoIP lookups, automatic user agent parsing for device properties, and supports currency conversion with ISO 4217 currency codes through the CURRENCY_CONVERT function and derived properties.

**Filtering and Blocking**: Comprehensive data quality controls through drop filters (query-time filtering), block filters (ingestion-time blocking including bot traffic using IAB/ABC International Spiders and Bots List), and IP address filtering while preserving location data.

The platform serves as the central nervous system for data governance in the Amplitude ecosystem, providing the tools and infrastructure necessary for organizations to implement scalable, maintainable analytics instrumentation while ensuring data quality and compliance across their entire analytics stack.
