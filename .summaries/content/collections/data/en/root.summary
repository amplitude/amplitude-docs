# Amplitude Data: Product Overview

## Core Product Overview

Amplitude Data is a comprehensive data governance platform that helps organizations define, track, verify, and improve the quality of their analytics data. It serves as a central hub for managing data taxonomy, ensuring consistent tracking implementation, and maintaining data quality across products and teams.

Key features of Amplitude Data include:

1. **Data Planning and Instrumentation**: Tools for creating tracking plans, defining events and properties, and implementing consistent data collection
2. **Data Management**: Capabilities for enriching metadata, cleaning up data, creating derived properties, and monitoring data quality
3. **Data Validation**: Real-time monitoring of event tracking against defined plans to identify issues
4. **Data Transformation**: Ability to retroactively modify event data without changing code

## Product Ecosystem and Relationships

Amplitude Data integrates with several components within the broader Amplitude ecosystem:

1. **Amplitude Analytics**: Data collected and managed through Amplitude Data feeds into Analytics for user behavior analysis, funnel tracking, and other analytics functions
2. **Amplitude SDKs**: Various SDKs (Browser, iOS Swift, Android-Kotlin) implement the tracking plans defined in Amplitude Data
3. **Ampli Developer Tools**: A lightweight wrapper for Amplitude SDKs that generates type-safe code based on tracking plans
4. **Destination Integrations**: Allows streaming of event data to third-party platforms
5. **Session Replay**: Captures user sessions for visual playback, complementing event data

Amplitude Data also offers integrations with external platforms:
- Shopify and WordPress plugins for e-commerce and content management
- Jira for issue tracking and development workflow
- Data warehouses (Snowflake, Databricks, S3) for profile data integration

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Data Collection Concepts
- **Events**: User actions or occurrences tracked in the system (e.g., page views, button clicks)
- **Event Properties**: Attributes specific to an event occurrence (e.g., button color, page name)
- **User Properties**: Attributes of users that persist across sessions (e.g., account type, language preference)
- **Group Properties**: Attributes associated with organizational groupings of users
- **Autocapture**: Automatic collection of standard events without manual instrumentation
- **Visual Labeling**: Interface for non-technical users to define events by clicking on website elements

### Data Management Concepts
- **Tracking Plan**: Specification of events, properties, and sources that defines the expected data structure
- **Property Groups**: Collections of properties that can be applied to multiple events
- **Custom Events**: Combinations of multiple events using OR logic
- **Derived Properties**: Properties created retroactively using formulas applied to existing properties
- **Lookup Tables**: Mappings that enrich event data with additional information from imported CSV files
- **Transformations**: Query-time modifications to event data that don't alter raw data
- **Channels**: Retroactive property classifications based on UTM parameters and referrer data

### Data Governance Concepts
- **Schema Violations**: Unexpected events, properties, or property values not defined in tracking plans
- **Data Access Control (DAC)**: Enterprise feature for restricting access to sensitive data
- **Time-to-Live (TTL)**: Controls for setting data retention periods at organization and project levels
- **Block Filters**: Prevent specific data from being ingested (e.g., bot traffic)
- **Drop Filters**: Query-time filtering that doesn't affect data ingestion

## Implementation Approaches

Amplitude Data supports multiple implementation approaches:

1. **Client-side Tracking**:
   - Browser SDK for web applications
   - iOS Swift SDK for Apple devices
   - Android-Kotlin SDK for Android devices
   - Plugins for platforms like Shopify and WordPress

2. **Server-side Tracking**:
   - HTTP V2 API for server-to-server event transmission
   - Batch Event Upload API for bulk data ingestion
   - Server-side SDKs for various programming languages

3. **Hybrid Approaches**:
   - Combining client and server-side tracking for comprehensive coverage
   - Using server-side for sensitive operations and client-side for user interactions

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

### Key API Endpoints
- **HTTP V2 API**: `https://api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi` for server-side event tracking
- **Batch Event Upload API**: `https://api2.amplitude.com/batch` for historical data backfills
- **Taxonomy API**: For programmatic management of taxonomy elements

### SDK Configuration Options
- `batchEvents`: Controls event batching for efficiency
- `eventUploadThreshold`: Sets the number of events to batch before sending
- `trackingOptions`: Configures privacy controls like IP address anonymization
- `cssSelectorAllowlist`: Restricts Autocapture to specific elements
- `pageUrlAllowlist`: Limits tracking to specific pages

### Implementation Best Practices
1. Establish consistent naming conventions for events and properties
2. Use separate environments for testing and production
3. Implement proper user identification with user_id and device_id
4. Configure session tracking appropriately for your application
5. Use property operations (set, setOnce, unset, add, append, prepend) correctly
6. Consider data volume impacts when implementing Autocapture

## Collaborative Workflow Features

Amplitude Data supports team collaboration through:

1. **Branching**: Create isolated branches for tracking plan changes
2. **Version Publishing**: Publish branch versions for review
3. **Merge Requests**: Formalize the process of integrating changes
4. **Environment Settings**: Map tracking plans to different environments
5. **Team Reviews**: Require approvals before implementing changes
6. **Jira Integration**: Link tracking plan changes to development tickets
7. **AI Data Assistant**: Get automated suggestions for tracking plan improvements
