Amplitude Data is a comprehensive data governance and catalog management platform that provides end-to-end tools for planning, implementing, and managing analytics instrumentation across organizations. The platform serves as the central hub for defining data taxonomy, creating tracking plans, and ensuring data quality throughout the analytics lifecycle.

## Core Product Architecture

Amplitude Data operates as a governance layer that sits between data collection and analytics, providing both planning and management capabilities. The platform integrates deeply with Amplitude Analytics projects and supports cross-project analysis through portfolios that can combine up to 5 source projects with schema ranking for conflict resolution.

The product follows a branch-based development model similar to Git, where users create feature branches from main, make tracking plan modifications, publish changes to create versioned tracking plans, and merge back to main after team review approvals. This workflow supports collaboration through @mention notifications and stakeholder review processes.

## Key Features and Capabilities

**Data Planning and Instrumentation:**
- Tracking plan creation with events, event properties, user properties, and group properties (with Accounts add-on)
- Ampli Developer Tools integration for generating type-safe, autogenerated tracking libraries
- Visual Labeling for no-code event creation through DOM element selection with Autocapture
- Property groups for bulk management of event properties across multiple events
- CSV import/export functionality for bulk tracking plan modifications

**Data Management and Transformation:**
- Derived properties using formulas with functions (REGEXEXTRACT, SPLIT, CONCAT, mathematical operations, date/time functions)
- Lookup Tables for enriching properties by importing CSV data sources (100MB/1M row limits)
- Transformations for retroactive data structure modifications including event/property merging and value renaming
- Custom events creation combining multiple existing events with OR clauses
- Streaming transformations for forwarding transformed events to destinations

**Data Quality and Observability:**
- Observe feature for automatic event stream validation against tracking plans with status categorization (Unexpected, Valid, Invalid, Out of Date)
- AI Data Assistant for automated tracking plan optimization suggestions
- Schema violation handling with configurable responses (mark as unexpected or reject data)
- Drop filters for query-time filtering and block filters for ingestion-time blocking
- Chrome Extension (Amplitude Instrumentation Explorer) for real-time SDK debugging

**Integration and Connectivity:**
- Source catalog supporting client-side SDKs (Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Unity, Flutter) and server-side SDKs (Node.js, Go, Python, Java)
- Destination event streaming with real-time behavioral data forwarding (p95 latency 60 seconds)
- Third-party integrations including Shopify Plugin, WordPress Plugin, and Jira integration
- Cohort synchronization with multiple cadence options (one-time, scheduled, real-time)

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Data Concepts:**
- **Events**: User actions or occurrences tracked in the system
- **Event Properties**: Attributes specific to individual events at the time they occurred
- **User Properties**: Attributes of individual users that persist and update over time
- **Group Properties**: Properties associated with account-level entities (requires Accounts add-on)
- **Sources**: SDK or integration configurations within tracking plans

**Governance and Management:**
- **Tracking Plan**: Comprehensive schema defining all events, properties, and their specifications
- **Branches**: Feature development environments for tracking plan modifications
- **Property Groups**: Collections of event properties that can be applied to multiple events
- **Property Override**: Event-specific customization of shared property definitions
- **Schema Violations**: Instances where ingested data doesn't match tracking plan specifications

**Data Processing:**
- **Autocapture**: Automatic capture of user interactions (clicks, page views, form interactions) with minimal setup
- **Ampli**: Code generation tool creating type-safe SDK wrappers based on tracking plans
- **Derived Properties**: Computed properties created retroactively using formulas applied to existing data
- **Transformations**: Query-time modifications to event data structure without affecting raw data
- **Lookup Properties**: Enriched properties created by mapping ingested data to external CSV sources

**Access and Security:**
- **Data Access Control (DAC)**: Enterprise feature for managing access to sensitive data through property classification
- **Time-to-Live (TTL)**: Configurable data retention periods at organization and project levels
- **Role-based Permissions**: Admin/Manager/Member/Viewer access levels with specific capabilities

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Data serves as the foundational layer for the broader Amplitude ecosystem, integrating with:

**Amplitude Analytics**: Direct project mapping and portfolio creation for cross-project analysis, with automatic schema syncing and metadata management.

**Amplitude Experiment**: SDK integration for A/B testing with consistent instrumentation through shared tracking plans.

**Data Infrastructure**: Deep integration with data warehouses (Snowflake, Databricks, S3) through Change Data Capture (CDC) for Profiles, Mirror Sync strategies for Data Mutability, and warehouse connections for Lookup Tables.

**Development Workflow**: Git-like branching model with Ampli CLI integration (`ampli pull`, `ampli status --is-merged`) for seamless developer experience and CI/CD pipeline integration.

## API Endpoints and Technical Integration

**Core APIs:**
- **Taxonomy API**: CRUD operations for categories, event types, event properties, and user properties
- **HTTP V2 API**: Client-side event ingestion endpoint
- **Batch Event Upload API**: Server-side and historical data import with ingestion limits (500K events per device ID daily, 100 batches/1000 events per second)
- **Evaluation API**: Experiment feature flag evaluation

**Key CLI Commands:**
- `ampli pull`: Generate tracking library code from tracking plan
- `ampli status --is-merged`: Check if branch changes are merged to main

**Configuration Parameters:**
- `config.autocapture.elementInteractions`: Enable Visual Labeling (Browser SDK 2.10.0+)
- `fetchRemoteConfig`: Remote configuration merging for Autocapture settings
- `$skip_user_properties_sync`: Control user property synchronization during backfill
- `convertToAmplitudeFunc`: Data transformation rules for cloud storage imports

The platform supports comprehensive data lifecycle management from initial planning through implementation, monitoring, and optimization, making it essential for organizations requiring robust data governance and quality assurance in their analytics infrastructure.
