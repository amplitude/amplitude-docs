Amplitude Data is a comprehensive data governance and management platform that provides tools for planning, implementing, and maintaining analytics instrumentation across the entire data lifecycle. The platform serves as a centralized data catalog that enables teams to create structured tracking plans, generate type-safe code, and ensure data quality through real-time monitoring and validation.

## Core Product Architecture

Amplitude Data operates as the governance layer for Amplitude's analytics ecosystem, integrating with multiple components:

**Planning and Instrumentation Layer:**
- **Tracking Plans**: Schema definitions that specify events, properties, and data types
- **Ampli Developer Tools**: Code generation toolkit that creates type-safe wrappers for Amplitude SDKs
- **Branch Workflow**: Git-like versioning system for collaborative tracking plan development

**Data Management Layer:**
- **Transformations**: Retroactive data modification capabilities including event/property merging, renaming, and hiding
- **Custom Events**: Logical combinations of existing events using OR clauses
- **Derived Properties**: Formula-based properties computed from existing data using functions like REGEXEXTRACT, SPLIT, and CURRENCY_CONVERT
- **Lookup Tables**: CSV-based data enrichment for mapping external data to event properties

**Governance and Quality Layer:**
- **Schema Validation**: Real-time monitoring against tracking plans with violation handling
- **Data Access Control (DAC)**: Property classification and group-based permissions for sensitive data
- **AI Data Assistant**: Automated suggestions for tracking plan optimization

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events and Properties:**
- **Events**: User actions or occurrences tracked in the system
- **Event Properties**: Attributes specific to individual event instances
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes of users that update over time
- **Group Properties**: Account-level attributes for B2B analytics (requires Accounts add-on)

**Data Classification:**
- **Planned Events**: Events defined in tracking plans before implementation
- **Unexpected Events**: Events received but not defined in tracking plans
- **Live Events**: Events actively receiving data
- **Blocked Events**: Events prevented from ingestion through block filters
- **Transformed Events**: Events modified through transformation rules

**Schema Management:**
- **Sources**: Data ingestion points (SDKs, third-party integrations, APIs)
- **Environments**: Project mappings for development vs production separation
- **Branches**: Isolated workspaces for tracking plan modifications
- **Property Groups**: Collections of properties for bulk management across events

**Data Operations:**
- **Drop Filters**: Query-time filtering that excludes data from analysis
- **Block Filters**: Ingestion-time filtering that prevents data storage
- **Overrides**: Event-specific or property group-specific customizations
- **Autocapture**: Automatic tracking of user interactions without manual instrumentation

## Integration with Broader Ecosystem

**SDK Integration:**
Amplitude Data integrates with both client-side SDKs (Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Unity, Flutter) and server-side SDKs (Node.js, Go, Python, Java) through:
- **HTTP V2 API**: Real-time event ingestion
- **Batch Event Upload API**: Historical data backfill with 500K events per device ID daily limits
- **Evaluation API**: Feature flag and experiment evaluation

**Data Infrastructure:**
- **Warehouse Integrations**: Snowflake, Databricks, Amazon S3 with Mirror Sync strategies supporting INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations
- **Change Data Capture (CDC)**: Real-time synchronization for data mutability
- **Profiles**: Customer profile data joining using CDC and incremental modeling

**Third-Party Ecosystem:**
- **Source Catalog**: Integrations for data ingestion from external platforms
- **Destination Catalog**: Event streaming to downstream tools with 60-second p95 latency
- **Cohort Synchronization**: Real-time, scheduled, or one-time user segment syncing

## API Endpoints and CLI Commands

**Ampli CLI Commands:**
- `ampli pull`: Downloads tracking plan and generates type-safe code
- `ampli status --is-merged`: Checks branch merge status for CI/CD integration

**Key APIs:**
- **Taxonomy API**: CRUD operations for categories, event types, and properties
- **User Privacy API**: Complete user data deletion for GDPR/CCPA compliance
- **HTTP V2 API**: Event ingestion with user_agent field for bot filtering
- **Batch Event Upload API**: Historical data import with `$skip_user_properties_sync` flag

**Configuration Options:**
- **Schema Settings**: Handle violations with "Mark As Unexpected" or "Reject" options
- **Currency Conversion**: CURRENCY_CONVERT() function with ISO 4217 currency codes
- **Time-to-Live (TTL)**: Configurable data retention at organization and project levels

The platform supports enterprise-scale operations with features like cross-project portfolio analysis (up to 5 projects), object management for reusable analysis components, and comprehensive access controls through role-based permissions (Admin/Manager/Member/Viewer). Integration capabilities extend to development workflows through Jira integration for automatic issue creation and Git-like branching for collaborative tracking plan development.
