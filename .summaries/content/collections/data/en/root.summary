Amplitude Data is a comprehensive data governance and management platform that provides end-to-end control over analytics instrumentation, data quality, and taxonomy management. The platform serves as a centralized data catalog that enables teams to plan, implement, validate, and maintain consistent analytics tracking across their entire product ecosystem.

## Core Platform Components and Architecture

Amplitude Data operates through several interconnected modules that form a complete data governance solution. The **tracking plan** serves as the foundational schema definition, containing events, event properties, user properties, and group properties that define the analytics taxonomy. These tracking plans support a Git-like **branching workflow** where teams can create feature branches, make changes, publish versions, and merge back to main with team review approvals.

The platform integrates deeply with **Ampli**, a code generation toolkit that creates type-safe wrappers for Amplitude SDKs based on tracking plan definitions. This enables developers to implement analytics with autocompletion, compile-time validation, and automatic enforcement of event names and property values through commands like `ampli pull` and `ampli status --is-merged`.

Data ingestion occurs through multiple pathways including **client-side SDKs** (Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Unity, Flutter) and **server-side SDKs** (Node.js, Go, Python, Java), along with third-party integrations through the **source catalog**. The platform supports both real-time streaming via the **HTTP V2 API** and batch processing through the **Batch Event Upload API** for historical data backfill.

## Data Management and Transformation Capabilities

Amplitude Data provides extensive data transformation and enrichment capabilities that operate retroactively without modifying raw data. **Derived properties** allow creation of new event and user properties using formula functions like `PROPERTY()`, `REGEXEXTRACT`, `SPLIT`, and `PARALLEL_PRODUCT` for cart analysis. **Transformations** enable merging events and properties, renaming property values, and hiding values to fix implementation mistakes at query time.

**Lookup Tables** support CSV data import up to 100MB/1M rows for enriching properties through exact case-sensitive matching, commonly used for SKU mapping and property value transformation. **Custom events** combine multiple existing events with OR clauses for tracking related user activities across Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, and other chart types.

The platform includes sophisticated **currency conversion** capabilities with OOTB derived properties (Currency Converted Revenue/Price), the `CURRENCY_CONVERT()` function, ISO 4217 currency code support, and ExchangeRate API integration for multi-currency revenue analysis.

## Data Quality and Validation Framework

The **Observe feature** provides real-time event stream monitoring against tracking plans, automatically categorizing events with statuses (Unexpected, Valid, Invalid, Out of Date) and providing validation insights without code changes. This integrates with **schema configuration** that handles three types of violations: unplanned event types, unplanned properties, and unplanned property values, with options to "Mark As Unexpected" or "Reject" each violation type.

**Visual Labeling** enables non-technical users to create labeled events by clicking DOM elements on websites without code changes, requiring Browser SDK 2.10.0+ with `autocapture.elementInteractions` enabled. **Autocapture** automatically captures user interactions (clicks, page views, sessions, form interactions) across Browser SDK, iOS Swift SDK, and Android-Kotlin SDK with configuration options like `cssSelectorAllowlist` and `pageUrlAllowlist`.

Data quality is further maintained through **drop filters** (query-time filtering), **block filters** (ingestion-time blocking), and the **User Privacy API** for complete user deletion, along with **bot traffic blocking** using IAB/ABC International Spiders and Bots List User-Agent detection.

## Enterprise Features and Access Control

**Data Access Control (DAC)** provides Enterprise-level security through property classification (PII, revenue, sensitive) and group-based permissions, including chart blocking, Event Stream restrictions, and export/subscription enforcement. **Object Management** offers centralized control of reusable analysis objects including custom events, metrics, segments, and cohorts with bulk operations and official designation capabilities.

**Profiles** enable joining customer profile data from data warehouses (Snowflake, Databricks, S3) with behavioral product data using Change Data Capture (CDC) and incremental modeling for real-time user profile synchronization. **Data Mutability** supports INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations through Mirror Sync strategies with specific requirements like mandatory user IDs and disabled enrichment services.

## Integration and Streaming Ecosystem

The platform features extensive integration capabilities through the **destination catalog** for event streaming to downstream marketing, sales, and infrastructure tools with 60-second p95 latency targets and exponential backoff retry mechanisms. **Cohort synchronization** supports three sync cadences: one-time, scheduled (hourly/daily), and real-time (every minute) syncing with third-party destinations.

**Streaming transformations** enable forwarding of pre-existing transformed events and properties (Custom Events, Derived Properties, Transformed Events, Transformed Properties) to destinations. The **Taxonomy API** provides CRUD operations for categories, event types, event properties, and user properties, with restrictions that only planned events and properties can be edited.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Tracking Plan**: The foundational schema containing events, properties, and taxonomy definitions
- **Ampli**: Type-safe code generation toolkit for SDK implementation
- **Autocapture**: Automatic user interaction tracking with minimal setup
- **Derived Properties**: Retroactively created properties using formula functions
- **Schema Violations**: Unplanned events, properties, or values that don't match the tracking plan
- **Visual Labeling**: No-code event creation through DOM element interaction
- **Data Mutability**: INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations on event data
- **Mirror Sync**: Warehouse synchronization strategy using CDC/CDF
- **Property Groups**: Bulk management system for event properties across multiple events
- **Channels**: Retroactive property classifiers based on UTM and referrer data
- **Time-to-Live (TTL)**: Configurable event data retention periods

The platform supports various API endpoints including the HTTP V2 API for real-time ingestion, Batch Event Upload API for historical data, Evaluation API for experiments, and the Taxonomy API for programmatic schema management. Command line tools center around the Ampli CLI with commands like `ampli pull`, `ampli status --is-merged`, and integration with Git workflows for tracking plan version control.
