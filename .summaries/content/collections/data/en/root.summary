Amplitude Data is a comprehensive data governance and catalog management platform that provides end-to-end tools for planning, implementing, and managing analytics instrumentation across organizations. The platform serves as the central hub for defining data taxonomy, creating tracking plans, and ensuring data quality throughout the analytics lifecycle.

## Core Product Architecture

Amplitude Data operates as a governance layer that sits between data collection and analytics, providing both planning and management capabilities. The platform integrates deeply with Amplitude Analytics projects and supports cross-project analysis through portfolios that can combine up to 5 source projects with schema ranking for conflict resolution.

The system follows a Git-like branching model where users create feature branches from main to make tracking plan changes, publish those changes to create versioned tracking plans, and merge branches back to main after team review approvals. This workflow enables collaborative development with stakeholder reviews and testing environment integration.

## Key Features and Capabilities

**Data Planning and Instrumentation:**
- Tracking plan creation with events, event properties, user properties, and group properties
- Ampli Developer Tools integration for generating type-safe, autogenerated tracking libraries
- Visual Labeling for no-code event creation through DOM element selection
- Branch-based collaboration with merge requests and team reviews
- CSV import/export functionality for bulk tracking plan management

**Data Management and Transformation:**
- Custom Events that combine multiple existing events with OR clauses
- Derived Properties for creating new properties retroactively using formulas and functions
- Transformations for retroactive data structure modifications at query time
- Lookup Tables for enriching properties by mapping CSV data sources
- Currency conversion with OOTB derived properties and CURRENCY_CONVERT function

**Data Quality and Observability:**
- Observe feature for automatic event stream validation against tracking plans
- Schema violation handling with options to mark as unexpected or reject data
- AI Data Assistant for automated tracking plan optimization suggestions
- Drop filters for query-time filtering and block filters for ingestion-time blocking
- Chrome Extension (Amplitude Instrumentation Explorer) for real-time debugging

**Data Governance and Access Control:**
- Data Access Control (DAC) for Enterprise organizations with property classification (PII, revenue, sensitive)
- Role-based permissions (Admin/Manager/Member/Viewer) with group-based access controls
- Time-to-Live (TTL) configuration for event data retention at organization and project levels
- Object Management for centralized control of reusable analysis objects

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events and Properties:**
- **Events**: User actions or occurrences tracked in the system (e.g., "Button Clicked", "Purchase Completed")
- **Event Properties**: Attributes specific to individual events at the time they occurred
- **User Properties**: Attributes of individual users that persist across sessions (device type, location, User ID)
- **Group Properties**: Properties associated with account-level entities (requires Accounts add-on)

**Data Structure Components:**
- **Sources**: SDK or integration configurations within tracking plans
- **Property Groups**: Collections of event properties that can be bulk-applied to multiple events
- **Tracking Plan**: The complete schema definition including all events, properties, and their relationships
- **Branches**: Feature development environments for making tracking plan changes
- **Portfolios**: Cross-project analysis containers combining multiple source projects

**Data Processing Concepts:**
- **Autocapture**: Automatic capture of user interactions (clicks, page views, form interactions) with minimal setup
- **Schema Violations**: Occurrences of unplanned event types, properties, or property values
- **Transformations**: Retroactive modifications to event data structure applied at query time
- **Derived Properties**: New properties created using formulas applied to existing properties
- **Channels**: Retroactive property classifiers based on UTM and referrer data for acquisition tracking

## Integration Ecosystem

Amplitude Data integrates extensively with the broader Amplitude ecosystem and external platforms:

**SDK Integration:**
- Client-side SDKs: Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Unity, Flutter
- Server-side SDKs: Node.js, Go, Python, Java
- API endpoints: HTTP V2 API, Batch Event Upload, Evaluation API

**Third-Party Integrations:**
- E-commerce platforms: Shopify Plugin with automatic event tracking and Session Replay
- Content management: WordPress Plugin with advanced Autocapture functionality
- Development tools: Jira integration for automatic issue creation on branch changes
- Data warehouses: Snowflake, Databricks, Amazon S3 for Profiles and data mutability

**Data Flow and Streaming:**
- Destination event streaming for real-time behavioral data forwarding
- Cohort synchronization with third-party destinations (one-time, scheduled, real-time)
- Streaming transformations for forwarding pre-existing transformed events and properties

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Core APIs:**
- **Taxonomy API**: CRUD operations for categories, event types, event properties, and user properties
- **Batch Event Upload API**: Historical data import with ingestion limits (500K events per device ID daily)
- **HTTP V2 API**: Real-time event ingestion
- **User Privacy API**: Data deletion for GDPR/CCPA compliance

**CLI Tools:**
- **Ampli CLI**: Code generation and tracking plan synchronization
  - `ampli pull`: Download tracking plan and generate code
  - `ampli status --is-merged`: Check branch merge status

**Configuration Options:**
- Schema settings for handling violations (unexpected vs reject)
- Autocapture configuration with CSS selector allowlists
- Currency conversion with ISO 4217 currency codes and ExchangeRate API integration
- Data mutability with Mirror Sync strategies across warehouse integrations

The platform enforces data quality through comprehensive validation, supports enterprise-grade governance with access controls and retention policies, and provides extensive automation through AI-powered suggestions and visual interfaces for non-technical users.
