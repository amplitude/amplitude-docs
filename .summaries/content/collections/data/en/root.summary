Amplitude Data is a comprehensive data governance and management platform that provides tools for planning, implementing, and maintaining analytics instrumentation across the entire data lifecycle. The platform serves as a centralized data catalog that enables organizations to create structured tracking plans, generate type-safe code, monitor data quality, and transform data retroactively.

## Core Product Architecture

Amplitude Data operates as the governance layer above Amplitude Analytics, providing schema management and data quality controls. The platform integrates with multiple data ingestion methods including client-side SDKs (Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Unity, Flutter), server-side SDKs (Node.js, Go, Python, Java), cloud storage imports (Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage), warehouse integrations (Snowflake, Databricks), and third-party sources through the source catalog.

The platform follows a branch-based development model similar to Git, where users create feature branches from the main tracking plan, make changes, publish versions, undergo team reviews through merge requests, and finally merge approved changes back to main. This workflow ensures collaborative development and maintains data integrity across environments.

## Key Features and Capabilities

**Tracking Plan Management**: Users create comprehensive tracking plans that define events, event properties, user properties, and group properties with detailed schemas including data types, validation rules, and metadata. The platform supports property groups for bulk management and allows overriding property definitions for specific events without modifying the original shared version.

**Ampli Developer Tools**: The platform generates type-safe, autogenerated tracking libraries through the Ampli CLI (`ampli pull`, `ampli status --is-merged`) that provide compile-time validation, autocompletion, and runtime checks to prevent instrumentation errors.

**Data Quality Monitoring**: The Observe feature automatically validates incoming event streams against tracking plans, surfacing data quality issues like missing properties, wrong data types, and schema mismatches. The platform categorizes events as Valid, Invalid, Unexpected, or Out of Date.

**Schema Management**: Comprehensive schema settings handle three types of violations - unplanned event types, unplanned properties, and unplanned property values - with options to either mark as unexpected or reject data entirely. The platform supports CSV import/export for bulk schema management.

**Data Transformation**: Retroactive data modification capabilities include derived properties with formula editors supporting string/math/date/array functions, transformations for merging/renaming events and properties, custom events that combine multiple events with OR clauses, and lookup tables for property enrichment via CSV imports.

## Advanced Data Management

**Autocapture and Visual Labeling**: Automated event capture for user interactions (clicks, page views, form interactions) across Browser SDK, iOS Swift SDK, and Android-Kotlin SDK, with Visual Labeling enabling no-code event creation through DOM element selection.

**Data Access Control (DAC)**: Enterprise-level feature for classifying properties as PII, revenue, or sensitive data with group-based permissions enforcement across all Amplitude interfaces including charts, exports, and APIs.

**Cross-Project Analysis**: Portfolio feature enables analysis across up to 5 source projects with schema ranking for conflict resolution and automatic override creation for Analytics-managed portfolios.

**Data Mutability**: Mirror Sync strategies enable INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations through Change Data Capture (CDC) for Snowflake, Change Data Feed (CDF) for Databricks, and warehouse synchronization with mandatory user IDs and disabled enrichment services.

## Integration Ecosystem

**E-commerce Platforms**: Pre-built plugins for Shopify (tracking standard events like product viewed, cart actions, checkout flow) and WordPress (advanced Autocapture with 8 event types) that automatically install Browser SDK with Session Replay capabilities.

**Development Tools**: Chrome extension (Event Explorer/Instrumentation Explorer) for real-time SDK debugging, Jira integration for automatic issue creation on branch changes, and comprehensive API access through the Taxonomy API for CRUD operations.

**Data Streaming**: Real-time behavioral data forwarding to downstream tools with p95 latency targets of 60 seconds, exponential backoff retry mechanisms, and streaming transformations for pre-existing transformed events and properties.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Sources**: SDK configurations and third-party integrations that send data to Amplitude
- **Tracking Plan**: Comprehensive schema defining all events, properties, and validation rules
- **Property Groups**: Collections of event properties that can be applied to multiple events
- **Derived Properties**: Retroactively created properties using formulas and functions
- **Custom Events**: Combined events using OR clauses for related user activities
- **Lookup Tables**: CSV-based property enrichment with exact matching requirements
- **Channels**: Retroactive property classifiers based on UTM and referrer data
- **Profiles**: Customer profile data integration from warehouses using CDC
- **Ampli**: Type-safe code generation wrapper for Amplitude SDKs
- **Visual Labeling**: No-code event creation through DOM element selection
- **Time-to-Live (TTL)**: Configurable data retention periods with irreversible deletion
