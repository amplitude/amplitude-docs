# Amplitude Data: Product Overview

Amplitude Data is a comprehensive data governance platform that helps organizations define, track, verify, and improve the quality of their analytics data. It provides tools for data planning, instrumentation, management, and observability to ensure consistent, high-quality analytics implementation.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Data Planning and Instrumentation
- **Tracking Plans**: Central specifications for events, properties, and sources that define what data should be collected
- **Branching Workflow**: Collaborative environment for making isolated changes to tracking plans before integrating into production
- **Ampli Developer Toolkit**: Generates type-safe, autogenerated code based on tracking plans for error-free implementation
- **Visual Labeling**: No-code event tracking interface that allows non-technical users to create labeled events by clicking elements on websites

### Data Management
- **Metadata Enrichment**: Add descriptions, display names, and categorizations to events and properties
- **Property Groups**: Collections of properties that can be applied to multiple events simultaneously
- **Transformations**: Retroactive modifications to correct implementation mistakes without changing code
- **Custom Events**: Combine multiple existing events with OR clauses to track related activities
- **Derived Properties**: Create new properties retroactively using functions and operators
- **Lookup Tables**: Import custom data to map and enhance existing properties (limited to 100MB/1M rows)
- **Data Access Control**: Restrict access to sensitive data through permission groups (Enterprise only)

### Data Observability
- **Validation**: Automatic monitoring of event tracking against tracking plans
- **AI Data Assistant**: Generates prioritized suggestions for tracking plan improvements
- **Schema Violation Handling**: Configure how to handle unexpected data (mark as unexpected or reject)

### Data Collection Methods
- **Client-side Tracking**: Browser SDK, iOS Swift SDK, Android-Kotlin SDK
- **Server-side Tracking**: Server SDKs for various languages
- **Autocapture**: Automatic collection of user interactions with minimal setup
- **Plugins**: Pre-built integrations for platforms like WordPress and Shopify

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Events**: User actions or occurrences tracked in the system
- **Event Properties**: Attributes specific to individual events
- **User Properties**: Attributes that persist across a user's sessions
- **Group Properties**: Attributes associated with organizational groupings
- **Sources**: Origins of data (client-side, server-side, or third-party)
- **Tracking Plan**: Specification of events and properties to be collected
- **Schema Violations**: Unexpected data that doesn't match the tracking plan
- **Transformations**: Query-time modifications to correct data issues
- **Autocapture**: Automatic tracking of user interactions without manual instrumentation
- **Ampli**: Lightweight wrapper for Amplitude SDKs that enforces tracking plan compliance

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Data integrates with the broader Amplitude ecosystem:
- **Amplitude Analytics**: Data collected through Amplitude Data feeds into Analytics for analysis
- **Portfolios**: Combine multiple source projects for cross-product analysis
- **Event Streaming**: Share behavioral data with external tools and destinations
- **Cohort Synchronization**: Export user segments to third-party platforms
- **Profiles**: Join customer profile data from data warehouses with behavioral product data
