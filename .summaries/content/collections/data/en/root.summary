Amplitude Data is a comprehensive data governance and management platform that provides tools for planning, implementing, and maintaining analytics instrumentation across the entire data lifecycle. The platform serves as a centralized data catalog that enables organizations to create structured tracking plans, generate type-safe code, and ensure data quality through real-time monitoring and validation.

## Core Product Architecture and Features

Amplitude Data operates around several key components that work together to provide end-to-end data governance:

**Tracking Plans and Schema Management**: The platform centers on tracking plans - structured schemas that define events, event properties, user properties, and group properties. These plans serve as the source of truth for analytics implementation and support branching workflows for collaborative development. Users can create events with detailed metadata including descriptions, data types (string, number, boolean, array, enum, const, any), and validation rules.

**Ampli Developer Toolkit**: A code generation system that creates type-safe wrappers for Amplitude SDKs based on tracking plans. The Ampli CLI (`ampli pull`, `ampli status --is-merged`) generates autocompletion-enabled code that provides compile-time validation and prevents instrumentation errors.

**Data Ingestion and Sources**: The platform supports multiple data ingestion methods including client-side SDKs (Browser, Android, iOS, Unity, Flutter, React Native), server-side SDKs (Node.js, Go, Python, Java), HTTP V2 API, Batch Event Upload API, and third-party integrations. It includes specialized plugins for Shopify and WordPress with advanced Autocapture capabilities.

**Real-time Data Validation and Observability**: The Observe feature automatically monitors event streams and validates them against tracking plans, categorizing events as Unexpected, Valid, Invalid, or Out of Date. This provides runtime validation without code changes and includes SDK source attribution and environment-specific filtering.

## Data Transformation and Enhancement

Amplitude Data provides several mechanisms for enhancing and transforming data:

**Derived Properties**: Enterprise-level feature enabling retroactive creation of new properties using formulas with functions like REGEXEXTRACT, SPLIT, CONCAT, DATE_TIME_FORMATTER, and CURRENCY_CONVERT. These are computed on-the-fly without affecting raw data.

**Transformations**: Query-time modifications that allow merging events/properties, renaming property values, and hiding values to fix implementation mistakes retroactively without altering raw data in warehouses.

**Custom Events**: Combine multiple existing events with OR clauses to track related user activities across various chart types, with specific limitations around Redshift querying.

**Lookup Tables**: Enable enrichment of event and user properties by importing CSV data sources (up to 100MB/1M rows) with case-sensitive exact matching for property value transformation.

## Data Quality and Governance

The platform includes comprehensive data quality controls:

**Schema Violation Handling**: Configurable responses to unplanned event types, properties, and property values with options to "Mark As Unexpected" or "Reject" violations.

**Data Access Control (DAC)**: Enterprise feature for managing access to sensitive data by classifying properties as PII, revenue, or sensitive data with group-based permissions through the Groups framework.

**Filtering and Blocking**: Drop filters for query-time filtering and block filters for ingestion-time blocking, including bot traffic filtering using IAB/ABC International Spiders and Bots List.

**AI Data Assistant**: Automatically generates prioritized suggestions for tracking plan improvements based on event volume and query counts analysis.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events**: User actions or occurrences tracked in the system, categorized as active/inactive affecting user metrics calculations.

**Event Properties**: Attributes specific to individual events at the time they occurred, with support for property groups for bulk management.

**User Properties**: Persistent attributes of users that update over time and persist across events, with operations including set, setOnce, unset, add, append, prepend.

**Group Properties**: Account-level properties for B2B analytics requiring the Accounts add-on.

**Sources**: SDK implementations or data ingestion points configured within tracking plans.

**Branches**: Isolated environments for tracking plan development with merge capabilities back to main branch.

**Property Override**: Customization of shared property definitions for specific events or property groups without affecting the original version.

## Integration and Ecosystem

Amplitude Data integrates extensively with the broader Amplitude ecosystem and external tools:

**Analytics Integration**: Direct integration with Amplitude Analytics for cross-project analysis through portfolios (up to 5 source projects) with schema ranking for conflict resolution.

**Warehouse Integrations**: Support for Snowflake, Databricks, and Amazon S3 with Change Data Capture (CDC) and Change Data Feed (CDF) capabilities for data mutability operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).

**Destination Event Streaming**: Real-time behavioral data forwarding to downstream marketing and sales tools with 60-second p95 latency targets and configuration-based filtering.

**Third-party Integrations**: Cohort synchronization with various cadences (one-time, scheduled hourly/daily, real-time minute-by-minute) and extensive source catalog for data ingestion.

**Development Tools**: Chrome extension for debugging (Amplitude Instrumentation Explorer), Jira integration for automatic issue creation, and Git integration for branch management.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

Key API endpoints and technical components include:

- **HTTP V2 API**: Client-side event ingestion
- **Batch Event Upload API**: Server-side and historical data import with limits of 500K events per device ID daily
- **Evaluation API**: For Amplitude Experiment integration  
- **Taxonomy API**: CRUD operations for categories, event types, and properties
- **User Privacy API**: GDPR/CCPA compliance for user deletion

**Configuration Options**: SDKs support various configuration parameters including `batchEvents`, `sessionTimeout`, `minTimeBetweenSessions`, `eventUploadThreshold`, `cssSelectorAllowlist`, `pageUrlAllowlist`, and `trackingOptions`.

**Autocapture Capabilities**: Automatic capture of user interactions (Element Clicked, Element Changed, Page Viewed, Session events) with visual labeling for no-code event creation and privacy protections for sensitive elements.

The platform supports various plan tiers (Starter, Plus, Growth, Enterprise) with different feature limitations and capabilities, particularly around advanced features like derived properties, data access control, and unlimited branching.
