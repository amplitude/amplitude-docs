# Amplitude Data: Product Overview

Amplitude Data is a comprehensive data governance platform that helps organizations define, track, verify, and improve the quality of their analytics data. It provides tools for planning, instrumenting, managing, and monitoring data to ensure consistent, high-quality analytics across an organization.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Data Planning and Instrumentation
- **Tracking Plans**: Centralized repository to define, document, and manage events, properties, and data sources
- **Ampli Developer Tools**: Type-safe code generation for implementing tracking plans with reduced errors
- **Branching Workflow**: Git-like branching system for collaborative tracking plan management
- **Visual Labeling**: No-code event creation through clicking elements on websites with Autocapture enabled

### Data Collection Methods
- **Client-side Tracking**: Browser SDK (web), iOS Swift SDK, Android-Kotlin SDK
- **Server-side Tracking**: Server SDKs and HTTP V2 API for backend event tracking
- **Autocapture**: Automatic collection of user interactions (clicks, page views, form submissions) with minimal setup
- **Platform Plugins**: Pre-built integrations for WordPress, Shopify, and other platforms

### Data Management and Enrichment
- **Transformations**: Retroactive modifications to correct implementation mistakes without changing code
- **Custom Events**: Combining multiple events with OR clauses to track related activities
- **Derived Properties**: Creating new properties using formulas applied to existing properties
- **Lookup Tables**: Enriching data by mapping property values to additional information from CSV files
- **Channels**: Creating retroactive property classifications based on UTM and referrer data

### Data Quality and Governance
- **Schema Configuration**: Controls for handling unexpected data (unplanned events, properties, values)
- **Data Validation**: Real-time monitoring of events against tracking plans
- **AI Data Assistant**: Automated suggestions for tracking plan improvements
- **Data Access Control**: Restricting access to sensitive data through permission groups
- **Time-to-Live (TTL)**: Configurable data retention periods at organization and project levels

### Cross-Project and Integration Capabilities
- **Portfolios**: Combining multiple source projects for cross-product analysis
- **Event Streaming**: Sharing behavioral data with external tools and platforms
- **Cohort Synchronization**: Exporting user segments to third-party destinations

## Product Relationships and Ecosystem

Amplitude Data integrates with the broader Amplitude platform:

1. **Amplitude Analytics**: Data collected and managed through Amplitude Data powers the analytics capabilities
2. **Amplitude Experiment**: Clean, well-structured data enables more effective experimentation
3. **Session Replay**: Enhanced by proper instrumentation and Autocapture configuration

Amplitude Data also connects with external systems:
- **Data Warehouses**: Integration with Snowflake, Databricks, and S3 for Profiles feature
- **Marketing Platforms**: Event streaming to destinations like Braze, AppsFlyer
- **Development Tools**: Jira integration for linking tracking plan changes to issues
- **CMS Platforms**: WordPress and Shopify plugins for simplified implementation

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Events**: User actions or system occurrences tracked in Amplitude (e.g., page views, button clicks)
- **Event Properties**: Attributes specific to an event occurrence (e.g., button color, page URL)
- **User Properties**: Attributes of users that persist across events (e.g., account type, location)
- **Group Properties**: Attributes of organizational units users belong to
- **Property Groups**: Collections of properties that can be applied to multiple events
- **Sources**: Origins of data (SDKs, APIs, third-party integrations)
- **Tracking Plan**: Specification of expected events, properties, and their metadata
- **Schema Violations**: Deviations from the defined tracking plan (unplanned events/properties)

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

### Taxonomy API
Enables programmatic management of taxonomy elements:
- `GET /api/2/taxonomy/categories`
- `POST /api/2/taxonomy/categories`
- `GET /api/2/taxonomy/event-types`
- `POST /api/2/taxonomy/event-types`
- `GET /api/2/taxonomy/properties`
- `POST /api/2/taxonomy/properties`

### Batch Event Upload API
Used for data backfills with considerations:
- Throttling limit: 300 events per second per device ID
- Daily limit: 500K events
- Endpoint: `https://api2.amplitude.com/batch`

### SDK Configuration Options
- `batchEvents`: Enables event batching for more efficient network usage
- `eventUploadThreshold`: Number of events to batch before sending
- `trackingOptions`: Controls for IP address and location tracking
- `cssSelectorAllowlist`: Restricts Autocapture to specific elements
- `pageUrlAllowlist`: Limits Autocapture to specific pages

### Ampli CLI Commands
- `ampli pull`: Fetches the latest tracking plan
- `ampli status`: Shows differences between local and remote tracking plans

## Best Practices

1. **Data Planning**: Define business objectives before instrumenting, create consistent naming conventions
2. **Implementation**: Use separate environments for testing, leverage Ampli for type-safe tracking
3. **Data Quality**: Configure schema settings to handle unexpected data appropriately
4. **Governance**: Implement Data Access Control for sensitive information
5. **Maintenance**: Regularly review and update tracking plans, use AI Data Assistant for suggestions

Amplitude Data serves as the foundation for effective analytics by ensuring data quality, consistency, and governance across an organization's data collection processes.
