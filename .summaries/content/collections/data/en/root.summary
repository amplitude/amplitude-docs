Amplitude Data is a comprehensive data governance and management platform that provides tools for planning, implementing, and maintaining analytics instrumentation across the entire data lifecycle. The platform serves as a centralized data catalog that enables organizations to create structured tracking plans, generate type-safe code, monitor data quality, and transform data retroactively.

## Core Product Architecture

Amplitude Data operates as the governance layer for Amplitude's analytics ecosystem, integrating with multiple components:

**Planning and Instrumentation Layer:**
- **Tracking Plans**: Schema definitions that specify events, properties, and data types
- **Ampli Developer Tools**: Code generation toolkit that creates type-safe wrappers for Amplitude SDKs
- **Branch-based Workflow**: Git-like versioning system for collaborative tracking plan development
- **Visual Labeling**: No-code interface for creating events through website element interaction

**Data Ingestion and Processing:**
- **Client-side SDKs**: Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Unity, Flutter
- **Server-side SDKs**: Node.js, Go, Python, Java  
- **Third-party Integrations**: Segment, mParticle, Tealium, Shopify, WordPress
- **Cloud Storage Imports**: Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage with converter configurations
- **Warehouse Integrations**: Snowflake, Databricks with CDC/CDF capabilities

**Data Management and Transformation:**
- **Schema Validation**: Real-time monitoring against tracking plans with violation handling
- **Transformations**: Retroactive data modification including event/property merging and renaming
- **Derived Properties**: Formula-based property creation using functions and operators
- **Custom Events**: OR-clause combinations of existing events
- **Lookup Tables**: CSV-based property enrichment through external data mapping

## Key Product Relationships

The platform follows a hierarchical data model where **Organizations** contain **Projects**, which house **Tracking Plans** that define **Events** with **Event Properties** and **User Properties**. Events can be organized into **Property Groups** for bulk management, and **Sources** represent different SDK implementations or data ingestion points.

**Autocapture** functionality automatically captures user interactions across Browser SDK, iOS Swift SDK, and Android-Kotlin SDK, generating events like Element Clicked, Element Changed, Page Viewed, and Session tracking with configurable allowlists and privacy controls.

**Profiles** enable joining customer profile data from warehouses with behavioral data using Change Data Capture, supporting INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations through mutation_type specifications.

## Essential Nomenclature and Definitions

**Schema Violations**: Three types of unplanned data - event types, properties, and property values - handled through "mark as unexpected" or "reject" policies

**Data Mutability**: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations on event data through Mirror Sync strategies with warehouse integrations

**Channels**: Retroactive property classifiers based on UTM and referrer data for acquisition tracking

**Time-to-Live (TTL)**: Configurable data retention periods at organization and project levels with irreversible deletion

**Data Access Control (DAC)**: Enterprise feature for classifying properties as PII, revenue, or sensitive data with group-based permissions

**Streaming Transformations**: Real-time forwarding of transformed events and properties to downstream destinations

**Environment Settings**: Legacy feature mapping production/development environments to specific Analytics projects

## Broader Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Data serves as the central nervous system for the broader Amplitude ecosystem, connecting to:

**Analytics Platform**: Provides schema validation and metadata enrichment for Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, and other chart types

**Experiment Platform**: Supports A/B testing through Web Experiment capabilities and Evaluation API integration

**Destination Ecosystem**: Event streaming to marketing tools (Braze, Iterable), ad networks (Facebook, Google, Twitter), and attribution providers with p95 latency targets of 60 seconds

**Developer Ecosystem**: Integration with Jira for automatic issue creation, Chrome Extension for debugging, and comprehensive API access through Taxonomy API

## Key API Endpoints and Commands

**Ampli CLI Commands:**
- `ampli pull` - Generate tracking libraries from tracking plans
- `ampli status --is-merged` - Check branch merge status

**API Endpoints:**
- **HTTP V2 API**: Client-side event ingestion
- **Batch Event Upload API**: Server-side and backfill data ingestion with 500K events per device ID daily limits
- **Evaluation API**: Experiment feature flag evaluation
- **Taxonomy API**: CRUD operations for categories, events, and properties
- **User Privacy API**: GDPR/CCPA compliance for data deletion

**Configuration Parameters:**
- `config.autocapture.elementInteractions`: Enable Visual Labeling
- `fetchRemoteConfig`: Browser SDK remote configuration
- `$skip_user_properties_sync`: Control user property synchronization during backfill
- `convertToAmplitudeFunc`: Data transformation configuration for cloud imports

The platform enforces various limits including 100MB/1M rows for Lookup Tables, 5-project limits for portfolios, and specific event volume quotas with 429 response codes for throttling. Data processing maintains chronological order with idempotency design and supports both real-time (minute-by-minute) and scheduled (hourly/daily) synchronization patterns.
