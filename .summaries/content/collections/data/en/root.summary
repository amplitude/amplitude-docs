Amplitude Data is a comprehensive data governance and management platform that provides end-to-end control over analytics instrumentation, data quality, and taxonomy management. The platform serves as a centralized data catalog that enables teams to plan, implement, validate, and maintain consistent analytics tracking across their entire product ecosystem.

## Core Platform Components and Architecture

Amplitude Data operates through several interconnected modules that form a complete data governance solution:

**Tracking Plans and Schema Management**: The foundation of Amplitude Data is the tracking plan system, which defines the complete analytics schema including events, event properties, user properties, and group properties. Tracking plans support a Git-like branching workflow where teams can create feature branches, make changes, publish versions, and merge back to main with team review processes. The platform enforces schema validation with configurable violation handling - teams can choose to either "Mark As Unexpected" or "Reject" unplanned event types, properties, or property values.

**Ampli Developer Tools**: The platform generates type-safe, auto-generated tracking libraries through the Ampli CLI (`ampli pull`, `ampli status --is-merged`) that provide compile-time validation, autocompletion, and runtime checks against the defined tracking plan. This ensures instrumentation consistency and reduces implementation errors.

**Data Transformation and Enhancement**: Amplitude Data provides multiple layers of data transformation including derived properties (retroactive property creation using formulas), custom events (combining multiple events with OR clauses), lookup tables (CSV-based property enrichment), transformations (retroactive event/property merging and renaming), and streaming transformations for real-time data forwarding.

## Data Ingestion and Integration Ecosystem

The platform supports comprehensive data ingestion through multiple pathways:

**SDK Integration**: Client-side SDKs (Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Unity, Flutter) and server-side SDKs (Node.js, Go, Python, Java) connect to corresponding API endpoints (HTTP V2 API, Batch Event Upload API, Evaluation API). The platform includes specialized plugins for Shopify (with Web Pixels API integration) and WordPress (with advanced Autocapture functionality).

**Third-Party Sources**: The source catalog enables integration with external platforms through the destination catalog, supporting event streaming with 60-second p95 latency targets and exponential backoff retry mechanisms.

**Data Warehouse Integration**: Support for Snowflake, Databricks, and Amazon S3 through converter configuration with `convertToAmplitudeFunc` transformation rules and comprehensive operators for data mapping.

## Advanced Data Management Features

**Autocapture and Visual Labeling**: The platform provides automatic event capture for user interactions (Element Clicked, Element Changed, page views, sessions) with visual labeling capabilities that allow non-technical users to create labeled events through a point-and-click interface, requiring Browser SDK 2.10.0+ with `autocapture.elementInteractions` enabled.

**Data Mutability and Profiles**: Enterprise features include data mutability with INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations through Mirror Sync strategies using Change Data Capture (CDC) and Change Data Feed (CDF). Amplitude Profiles enables joining customer profile data from warehouses with behavioral data using incremental modeling.

**Data Access Control (DAC)**: Enterprise-level security through property classification (PII, revenue, sensitive) with group-based permissions, chart blocking, Event Stream restrictions, and export/subscription enforcement.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events vs Properties**: Events represent user actions or system occurrences, while properties are attributes that describe either the event itself (event properties) or the user performing the action (user properties). Group properties enable account-level reporting with the Accounts add-on.

**Schema Violations**: Categorized as unplanned event types, unplanned event/user properties, or unplanned property values, with configurable handling through "Mark As Unexpected" or "Reject" settings.

**Event Status Categories**: Events are classified as Unexpected, Valid, Invalid, Out of Date, Active/Inactive, with activity status affecting active user metrics and dashboard calculations retroactively.

**Data Transformation Types**: 
- Derived Properties: Retroactive property creation using formulas with functions like `PROPERTY()`, `REGEXEXTRACT`, `SPLIT`
- Custom Events: OR-clause combinations of existing events with `[Custom]` prefix
- Transformations: Query-time modifications for merging, renaming, or hiding data
- Lookup Tables: CSV-based property enrichment with 100MB/1M row limits

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Data integrates deeply with the broader Amplitude ecosystem:

**Analytics Integration**: Direct integration with Amplitude Analytics through project mapping, portfolio creation for cross-project analysis (up to 5 source projects), and environment settings for production/development separation.

**Experiment Integration**: Support for Web Experiment capabilities with anti-flicker functionality and remote configuration through `fetchRemoteConfig`.

**Session Replay Integration**: Browser SDK integration with configurable sample rates and Session Replay Browser SDK Plugin support.

**Cohort and Destination Syncing**: Real-time cohort synchronization with third-party destinations using multiple cadence options (one-time, scheduled hourly/daily, real-time minute-by-minute) with 1,000,000 user limits.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Core APIs**:
- HTTP V2 API for client-side event ingestion
- Batch Event Upload API for server-side and backfill operations with 500K events per device ID daily limits
- Taxonomy API for CRUD operations on categories, event types, and properties
- User Privacy API for GDPR/CCPA compliance and complete user deletion

**Configuration Options**:
- SDK settings: `batchEvents`, `sessionTimeout`, `minTimeBetweenSessions`, `eventUploadThreshold`
- Autocapture settings: `cssSelectorAllowlist`, `actionClickAllowlist`, `pageUrlAllowlist`
- Data retention: Time-to-Live (TTL) configuration at organization and project levels
- Currency conversion: `CURRENCY_CONVERT()` function with ISO 4217 currency codes and ExchangeRate API integration

**Debugging and Monitoring**:
- Amplitude Instrumentation Explorer Chrome extension for real-time SDK debugging
- Event Streaming Debugger UI for destination monitoring
- AI Data Assistant for automated tracking plan optimization suggestions
- Observe feature for runtime validation against tracking plans with event overlay functionality

The platform operates on a tiered access model with role-based permissions (Admin/Manager/Member/Viewer) and supports various plan levels (Starter/Plus vs Growth/Enterprise) with different feature availability and limits.
