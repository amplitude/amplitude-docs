Amplitude Data is a comprehensive data governance and management platform that provides tools for planning, implementing, and maintaining analytics instrumentation across the entire data lifecycle. The platform serves as a centralized data catalog that enables organizations to create structured tracking plans, generate type-safe code, monitor data quality, and transform data retroactively.

## Core Product Architecture

Amplitude Data operates as the governance layer for Amplitude's analytics ecosystem, integrating with multiple components:

**Data Ingestion Layer**: Supports both client-side SDKs (Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Unity, Flutter) and server-side SDKs (Node.js, Go, Python, Java) through HTTP V2 API and Batch Event Upload API endpoints. Third-party integrations include Segment, mParticle, and Tealium, with specialized plugins for Shopify and WordPress platforms.

**Planning and Development Tools**: The Ampli Developer Toolkit generates type-safe tracking libraries from tracking plans, providing autocompletion and compile-time validation. The platform supports Git-like branching workflows with merge requests, team reviews, and version management for collaborative development.

**Data Management and Transformation**: Includes streaming transformations, derived properties, lookup tables, custom events, and real-time data quality monitoring through the Observe feature. The platform supports retroactive data modifications without affecting raw data in warehouses.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Tracking Plans**: Structured schemas defining events, event properties, user properties, and groups with validation rules and data types (String, Number, Boolean, Array, Enum, Const, Any).

**Sources**: SDK configurations within tracking plans that generate platform-specific instrumentation code through Ampli CLI commands like `ampli pull` and `ampli status --is-merged`.

**Branches**: Development environments for tracking plan changes, supporting pending changes staging, team review workflows, and merge operations back to main branch.

**Schema Violations**: Three types of data quality issues - unplanned event types, unplanned properties, and unplanned property values - with configurable handling (mark as unexpected or reject).

**Transformations**: Query-time data modifications including event/property merging, value renaming, and hiding, applied retroactively without affecting raw warehouse data.

**Property Groups**: Reusable collections of event properties that can be bulk-applied to multiple events with automatic propagation of updates.

**Autocapture**: Automated tracking of user interactions (Element Clicked, Element Changed, Page Viewed, Session Start/End) with configurable allowlists and privacy controls.

## Data Processing and Quality Management

The platform implements comprehensive data validation through schema enforcement, supporting ingestion limits of 500K events per device ID daily and 100 batches/1000 events per second. The Observe feature provides real-time monitoring with event status classifications (Unexpected, Valid, Invalid, Out of Date) and automatic detection of schema mismatches.

Data quality controls include block filters for preventing bot traffic ingestion using IAB/ABC International Spiders and Bots List, drop filters for query-time data exclusion, and Time-to-Live (TTL) configuration for data retention management at organization and project levels.

## Advanced Features and Enterprise Capabilities

**Data Access Control (DAC)**: Enterprise-level feature enabling property classification (PII, revenue, sensitive) with group-based permissions enforcement across charts, exports, and APIs.

**Derived Properties**: Formula-based property creation using functions like REGEXEXTRACT, SPLIT, DATE_TIME_FORMATTER, and PARALLEL_PRODUCT for retroactive data enrichment.

**Lookup Tables**: CSV-based data enrichment supporting up to 100MB/1M rows with case-sensitive exact matching for property value transformation.

**Cross-Project Analysis**: Portfolio feature combining up to 5 source projects with schema ranking for conflict resolution and metadata override management.

**Visual Labeling**: No-code event creation interface requiring Browser SDK 2.10.0+ with `config.autocapture.elementInteractions` enabled for non-technical users.

## Integration and Streaming Capabilities

The platform supports destination event streaming with p95 latency targets of 60 seconds, exponential backoff retry mechanisms, and real-time behavioral data forwarding to marketing and infrastructure tools. Cohort synchronization offers three cadence options: one-time, scheduled (hourly/daily), and real-time (every minute) syncing.

API access includes the Taxonomy API for CRUD operations on categories, event types, and properties, with restrictions limiting edits to planned events without existing project data. The Chrome extension (Event Explorer/Instrumentation Explorer) provides real-time debugging capabilities for JS SDK instrumentation.

The platform integrates with data warehouses through Amplitude Profiles using Change Data Capture (CDC) with support for Snowflake, Databricks, and S3, enabling incremental modeling with mutation_type operations (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) for customer profile data synchronization.
