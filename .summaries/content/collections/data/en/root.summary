2. **Ampli Developer Tools**: A lightweight wrapper for Amplitude SDKs that generates type-safe code based on tracking plans, providing:
   - Compile-time validation
   - Autocompletion for events and properties
   - Strict naming convention enforcement

3. **Branching Workflow**: Git-like version control for tracking plans:
   - Create branches from main
   - Make isolated changes
   - Publish versions
   - Submit merge requests
   - Team review process
   - Integration with Jira for issue tracking

4. **Data Collection Methods**:
   - **Client-side tracking**: Browser SDK, iOS Swift SDK, Android-Kotlin SDK
   - **Server-side tracking**: Server SDKs, HTTP V2 API, Batch Event Upload API

   - **Visual Labeling**: Non-technical interface for creating labeled events on websites

### Data Management and Governance

1. **Schema Configuration**: Controls for handling unexpected data:
   - Unplanned event types

   - Access restrictions across analytics features

3. **Time-to-Live (TTL)**: Data retention controls:
   - Organization-level retention periods
   - Project-level overrides
   - Daily deletion jobs

4. **Invalid Data Management**:
   - Drop filters (query-time filtering)
   - Block filters (preventing future data ingestion)
   - Data deletion options

### Data Transformation and Enrichment

1. **Transformations**: Retroactive modifications to correct implementation mistakes:
   - Merge events
   - Merge properties
   - Rename property values
   - Hide property values

2. **Derived Properties**: Create new properties using formulas:
   - String, math, date/time, array, and conditional operators
   - Retroactive application to existing data

3. **Lookup Tables**: Enrich data by mapping property values to additional information:
   - CSV file imports (up to 100MB or 1M rows)
   - Property enrichment
   - Bulk value changes

4. **Custom Events**: Combine multiple events with OR clauses:
   - Track related activities as a single event
   - Available in various chart types

5. **Channels**: Create retroactive property classifications based on UTM and referrer data:
   - Define custom channel categories
   - Compare metrics between channels
   - Various attribution models

### Data Validation and Monitoring

1. **Observe Feature**: Automatic monitoring of event tracking:
   - Real-time validation against tracking plans
   - Event status tracking (Unexpected, Valid, Invalid, Out of Date)
   - Environment-specific monitoring

2. **AI Data Assistant**: Automated suggestions for tracking plan improvements:
   - Prioritized modification suggestions
   - Direct implementation to tracking plans

3. **Chrome Extension Debug Tool**: Real-time instrumentation debugging:
   - Capture and display triggered events
   - Show event parameters
   - Filter, hide, or copy event data

### Integration Capabilities

1. **Event Streaming**: Share behavioral data with external tools:
   - Streaming transformations to destinations
   - Cohort synchronization (one-time, scheduled, real-time)
   - Webhook streaming

2. **Cross-Project Analysis**: Portfolio feature for multi-product analysis:
   - Combine multiple source projects
   - Create charts with aggregated data
   - Schema prioritization for conflict resolution

3. **Profiles**: Join customer profile data from data warehouses:
   - Integration with Snowflake, Databricks, and S3
   - Standalone properties associated with user profiles

4. **Plugin Ecosystem**:
   - Shopify Plugin
   - WordPress Plugin
   - Integration with various marketing and analytics platforms

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions
