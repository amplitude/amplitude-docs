Amplitude Data is a comprehensive data governance and management platform that provides tools for planning, implementing, and maintaining analytics instrumentation across the entire data lifecycle. The platform serves as a centralized data catalog that enables organizations to create structured tracking plans, generate type-safe code, monitor data quality, and transform data retroactively.

## Core Product Architecture

Amplitude Data operates as the governance layer for Amplitude's analytics ecosystem, integrating with multiple components:

- **Amplitude Analytics**: The core analytics platform where Data manages event schemas and metadata
- **Amplitude SDKs**: Client-side (Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Unity, Flutter) and server-side (Node.js, Python, Java, Go) SDKs that implement tracking
- **Ampli Developer Tools**: Code generation toolkit that creates type-safe tracking libraries from Data schemas
- **Third-party Integrations**: Source catalog for data ingestion and destination catalog for event streaming

The platform follows a branch-based workflow similar to Git, where users create feature branches for schema changes, collaborate through team reviews, and merge approved changes back to the main branch with versioned tracking plans.

## Key Features and Capabilities

### Data Planning and Schema Management
Amplitude Data enables creation of comprehensive tracking plans that define events, event properties, user properties, and group properties. The platform supports property groups for bulk management, derived properties for retroactive calculations, and lookup tables for data enrichment. Users can configure schema validation settings to handle unplanned events and properties through "mark as unexpected" or "reject" policies.

### Code Generation and Type Safety
The Ampli CLI (`ampli pull`, `ampli status --is-merged`) generates type-safe wrappers for Amplitude SDKs based on tracking plan definitions, providing autocompletion, compile-time validation, and runtime checks to prevent instrumentation errors.

### Data Quality and Observability
The Observe feature automatically monitors event streams against tracking plans, surfacing data quality issues like missing properties, wrong data types, and schema mismatches. The platform categorizes events as Valid, Invalid, Unexpected, or Out of Date, with real-time validation through the Event Explorer Chrome extension.

### Data Transformation and Management
Transformations allow retroactive modification of event data structure at query time without affecting raw data. Users can merge events/properties, rename property values, hide values, and create custom events that combine multiple existing events with OR clauses.

### Advanced Data Features
- **Autocapture**: Automatically captures user interactions (clicks, page views, form interactions) with minimal setup
- **Visual Labeling**: No-code interface for creating labeled events by clicking website elements
- **Profiles**: Integrates customer profile data from warehouses using Change Data Capture (CDC)
- **Data Mutability**: Enables INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations through Mirror Sync strategies

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Core Data Objects
- **Events**: User actions tracked in the application (e.g., "Button Clicked", "Page Viewed")
- **Event Properties**: Attributes specific to individual events at the time they occurred
- **User Properties**: Attributes of users that persist across sessions (device type, location, User ID)
- **Group Properties**: Account-level attributes for B2B analytics (requires Accounts add-on)
- **Sources**: SDK configurations that define how data is collected
- **Tracking Plan**: Comprehensive schema defining all events and properties for a project

### Data Management Concepts
- **Property Groups**: Collections of event properties that can be applied to multiple events
- **Derived Properties**: Calculated properties created using formulas applied to existing properties
- **Lookup Properties**: Properties enriched through CSV data mapping
- **Custom Events**: Combined events using OR clauses across multiple existing events
- **Transformed Events/Properties**: Retroactively modified data structures

### Validation and Quality
- **Schema Violations**: Unplanned event types, properties, or property values
- **Block Filters**: Ingestion-time filtering to prevent unwanted data
- **Drop Filters**: Query-time filtering for analysis exclusion
- **Data Access Control (DAC)**: Enterprise feature for managing access to sensitive data

### Workflow Management
- **Branches**: Feature branches for schema changes with Git-like workflow
- **Merge Requests**: Team review process for approving schema changes
- **Pending Changes**: Staged modifications before publishing
- **Versioned Tracking Plans**: Published schema versions with automatic numbering

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Data serves as the central nervous system for the broader Amplitude ecosystem:

### Analytics Integration
Data manages metadata, event visibility, and schema validation for Amplitude Analytics charts, cohorts, dashboards, and notebooks. The platform enforces Data Access Control restrictions across all analytics features and provides the foundation for cross-project analysis through portfolios.

### SDK and Implementation Layer
Data generates implementation code through Ampli, validates runtime instrumentation, and provides debugging tools like the Chrome extension Event Explorer. The platform supports both client-side and server-side implementation patterns with appropriate SDK recommendations.

### Data Infrastructure
The platform integrates with cloud storage (Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage), data warehouses (Snowflake, Databricks), and streaming platforms through configurable converters and transformation functions. Data Mutability features enable bidirectional synchronization with warehouse systems.

### Third-party Ecosystem
Source catalog enables data ingestion from platforms like Segment, mParticle, and Tealium, while destination catalog supports real-time event streaming to marketing automation, attribution, and infrastructure tools with p95 latency targets of 60 seconds.

## API Endpoints and Technical Integration

### Core APIs
- **Taxonomy API**: CRUD operations for categories, event types, event properties, and user properties
- **HTTP V2 API**: Client-side event ingestion endpoint
- **Batch Event Upload API**: Server-side and backfill data ingestion with 500K events per device ID daily limits
- **User Privacy API**: Data deletion for GDPR/CCPA compliance

### CLI Tools
- **Ampli CLI**: Primary developer tool for pulling schemas, checking merge status, and generating tracking libraries
- **ampli pull**: Downloads latest tracking plan schema
- **ampli status --is-merged**: Validates branch merge status for CI/CD integration

### Configuration Options
The platform provides extensive configuration through SDK options like `batchEvents`, `eventUploadThreshold`, `sessionTimeout`, `trackingOptions`, and Autocapture settings including `cssSelectorAllowlist`, `actionClickAllowlist`, and `pageUrlAllowlist` for precise event capture control.

Amplitude Data represents a comprehensive approach to analytics governance that bridges the gap between business requirements and technical implementation, ensuring data quality and consistency across the entire analytics lifecycle while providing the flexibility to adapt and transform data as business needs evolve.
