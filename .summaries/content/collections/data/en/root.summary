# Amplitude Data: Comprehensive Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude Data is a comprehensive data governance platform that helps organizations define, track, verify, and improve the quality of their analytics data. The platform provides tools for planning data collection, implementing tracking, managing data quality, and transforming data to ensure consistent, reliable analytics.

Key features include:
- Data planning and instrumentation tools for creating tracking plans
- Type-safe developer toolkits for implementing analytics tracking
- Data management capabilities for enriching, cleaning, and transforming data
- Real-time monitoring and validation against defined tracking plans
- Cross-project analysis for unified analytics across multiple products
- Access controls for sensitive data

Core use cases include:
- Creating standardized data taxonomies across organizations
- Implementing consistent event tracking across platforms
- Validating data quality against defined specifications
- Transforming and enriching data without changing source code
- Managing data access for privacy and security compliance

## Product Relationships and Architecture

Amplitude Data integrates with several components in the Amplitude ecosystem:

1. **Amplitude Analytics**: Data serves as the governance layer for Analytics, ensuring high-quality data flows into analytics dashboards and reports.

2. **Amplitude SDKs**: Multiple SDKs (Browser, iOS Swift, Android-Kotlin, server-side) connect with Data for implementation, with the Ampli wrapper providing type-safe code generation based on tracking plans.

3. **Data Sources**: Supports both client-side tracking (mobile/web apps) and server-side tracking, plus integrations with third-party platforms like Shopify and WordPress.

4. **Destinations**: Enables streaming of data to external tools and platforms through the destination catalog.

5. **External Tools**: Integrates with development tools like Jira for workflow management.

The platform follows a layered approach:
- **Planning Layer**: Tracking plans define the expected data structure
- **Implementation Layer**: SDKs and Ampli toolkit implement the tracking
- **Validation Layer**: Observe features validate incoming data against plans
- **Transformation Layer**: Tools to modify data without changing source code
- **Access Control Layer**: Controls who can access sensitive data

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Data Structure Components
- **Events**: User actions tracked in the system (e.g., page views, clicks)
- **Event Properties**: Attributes of specific events at the time they occur
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes of individual users
- **Group Properties**: Attributes of user groups or accounts
- **Property Groups**: Collections of properties that can be applied to multiple events

### Data Management Concepts
- **Tracking Plan**: Specification defining expected events, properties, and their characteristics
- **Schema Violations**: Unexpected events or properties not defined in the tracking plan
- **Transformations**: Retroactive modifications to event data without changing source code
- **Derived Properties**: New properties created using formulas applied to existing properties
- **Lookup Tables**: Mappings that enrich properties with additional data from external sources
- **Channels**: Classifications of acquisition sources based on UTM parameters and referrers

### Implementation Tools
- **Ampli**: Type-safe wrapper for Amplitude SDKs that generates code based on tracking plans
- **Autocapture**: Automatic collection of standard user interactions without manual instrumentation
- **Visual Labeling**: Interface for non-technical users to define events by clicking on website elements

### Workflow Concepts
- **Branches**: Isolated environments for making changes to tracking plans
- **Environments**: Separate contexts (development/production) for testing and implementing tracking

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Data serves as the foundation for reliable analytics within the broader Amplitude platform:

1. **Data Collection**: Integrates with multiple sources through SDKs, APIs, and plugins:
   - Browser, iOS, and Android SDKs for client-side tracking
   - Server-side SDKs and HTTP API for backend tracking
   - Plugins for platforms like WordPress and Shopify
   - Integrations with data warehouses like Snowflake, Databricks, and S3

2. **Data Governance**: Provides tools to ensure data quality:
   - Tracking plans define expected data structure
   - Schema validation identifies unexpected data
   - Transformations correct implementation issues
   - Access controls protect sensitive information

3. **Data Enrichment**: Enhances raw data with additional context:
   - Derived properties create new insights from existing data
   - Lookup tables add external data to events
   - Profiles join customer data from warehouses with behavioral data

4. **Data Distribution**: Shares data with other systems:
   - Event streaming sends data to external destinations
   - Cohort synchronization shares user segments with marketing tools

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

### Taxonomy API
Enables programmatic management of taxonomy elements:
- `GET /api/2/taxonomy/categories`
- `POST /api/2/taxonomy/categories`
- `GET /api/2/taxonomy/event-types`
- `POST /api/2/taxonomy/event-types`
- `GET /api/2/taxonomy/event-properties`
- `POST /api/2/taxonomy/event-properties`

### Ampli CLI Commands
- `ampli pull`: Pulls the latest tracking plan from Amplitude
- `ampli status`: Checks the status of the local tracking plan against Amplitude

### SDK Implementation Options
- **Browser SDK**: Configuration options for Autocapture and Session Replay
  ```javascript
  amplitude.init('API_KEY', {
    defaultTracking: {
      sessions: true,
      pageViews: true,
      formInteractions: true,
      fileDownloads: true
    }
  });
  ```

- **Server-Side API**: Batch Event Upload API for backfilling data
  ```
  POST https://api2.amplitude.com/batch
  ```

- **Data Transformation**: Formula functions for derived properties
  ```
  IF(CONTAINS(event_properties.page_url, "checkout"), "Checkout", "Other")
  ```

### WordPress Plugin Configuration
- API Key configuration in WordPress admin panel
- Autocapture settings for form tracking and element clicks
- Session Replay configuration with sample rate settings

### Shopify Plugin Implementation
- Requires adding an anti-flicker snippet to prevent visual flickering
- Automatically captures standard Shopify events like product views and checkouts
