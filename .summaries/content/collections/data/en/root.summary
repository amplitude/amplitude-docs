Amplitude Data is a comprehensive data governance and management platform that provides tools for planning, implementing, and maintaining analytics instrumentation across the entire data lifecycle. The platform serves as a centralized data catalog that enables organizations to create structured tracking plans, generate type-safe code, and ensure data quality through real-time monitoring and validation.

## Core Product Architecture

Amplitude Data operates as the governance layer for Amplitude's analytics ecosystem, built around several interconnected components:

**Tracking Plans** serve as the foundational schema definition system, allowing teams to define events, event properties, user properties, and group properties in a structured format. These plans support branching workflows similar to Git, enabling collaborative development with features like merge requests, team reviews, and environment-specific deployments.

**Ampli Developer Tools** provide code generation capabilities that transform tracking plans into type-safe, auto-generated libraries for various programming languages and frameworks. The Ampli CLI (`ampli pull`, `ampli status --is-merged`) enables developers to synchronize tracking plans with their codebase and validate implementation status.

**Data Ingestion and Validation** occurs through multiple pathways including client-side SDKs (Browser, Android, iOS, Unity, Flutter, React Native), server-side SDKs (Node.js, Go, Python, Java), and third-party integrations. The platform supports both the HTTP V2 API and Batch Event Upload API for different ingestion patterns.

## Key Features and Capabilities

**Schema Management** enables organizations to define and enforce data structure through configurable schema violation handling. The system can either "Mark As Unexpected" or "Reject" three types of violations: unplanned event types, unplanned properties, and unplanned property values.

**Data Transformations** allow retroactive modification of event data structure at query time without affecting raw data. This includes merging events/properties, renaming property values, and hiding values to fix implementation mistakes post-ingestion.

**Derived Properties** enable Enterprise users to create new event and user properties retroactively using formulas with functions like REGEXEXTRACT, SPLIT, CONCAT, DATE_TIME_FORMATTER, and CURRENCY_CONVERT applied to existing properties.

**Autocapture** automatically captures user interactions (clicks, page views, sessions, form interactions) across Browser SDK, iOS Swift SDK, and Android-Kotlin SDK with minimal setup, including visual labeling capabilities for non-technical users.

**Data Quality Monitoring** through the Observe feature automatically validates events against tracking plans, categorizing them with statuses (Unexpected, Valid, Invalid, Out of Date) and providing real-time insights into data quality issues.

## Advanced Data Management

**Lookup Tables** enable property enrichment by importing CSV data sources (up to 100MB/1M rows) and mapping them to ingested properties with case-sensitive exact matching.

**Custom Events** combine multiple existing events with OR clauses to track related user activities across various chart types in Amplitude Analytics.

**Channels** provide retroactive property classifiers based on UTM and referrer data for tracking acquisition channels with integration to Data Tables for attribution modeling.

**Data Access Control (DAC)** enables Enterprise organizations to classify properties as PII, revenue, or sensitive data and control group-based permissions through the Groups framework.

## Integration Ecosystem

**Event Streaming** enables real-time sharing of behavioral data to downstream marketing, sales, and infrastructure tools with configuration-based filtering, retry mechanisms, and 60-second p95 latency targets.

**Cohort Synchronization** supports three sync cadence options: one-time, scheduled (hourly/daily), and real-time (every minute) syncing with third-party destinations.

**Data Warehouse Integration** includes Mirror Sync strategies supporting INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations through Change Data Capture (CDC) for Snowflake, Change Data Feed (CDF) for Databricks, and Amazon S3 integrations.

**Platform-Specific Plugins** include pre-built integrations for Shopify (with Session Replay and Web Experiment capabilities) and WordPress (with advanced Autocapture functionality).

## API and Developer Tools

The **Taxonomy API** enables CRUD operations for categories, event types, event properties, and user properties, with restrictions that only planned events and properties can be edited.

**Chrome Extension Debug** tools include the Amplitude Instrumentation Explorer for real-time debugging of Amplitude JS SDK instrumentation with event parameter viewing and SDK configuration access.

**Data Backfill** capabilities through the Batch Event Upload API support historical data import with specific limits (500K events per device ID daily, 100 batches/1000 events per second) and user property sync control via `$skip_user_properties_sync`.

## Enterprise Features

**Cross-Project Analysis** through portfolios enables combining up to 5 source projects with schema ranking for conflict resolution.

**Time-to-Live (TTL)** configuration allows setting event data retention periods at organization and project levels with daily deletion jobs.

**Object Management** provides centralized management of reusable analysis objects including custom events, metrics, segments, and cohorts with bulk operations and official designation capabilities.

The platform integrates with external tools like Jira for automatic issue creation during feature branch changes and supports comprehensive CSV import/export functionality for tracking plan management. All features are designed to work within Amplitude's broader ecosystem while maintaining data integrity and providing enterprise-grade governance capabilities.
