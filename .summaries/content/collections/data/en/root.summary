# Amplitude Data: Product Overview

Amplitude Data is a comprehensive data governance platform that helps organizations define, track, verify, and improve the quality of their analytics data. It provides tools for planning, instrumenting, managing, and monitoring data across the analytics lifecycle.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Data Planning and Instrumentation
- **Tracking Plans**: Central repository for defining and documenting events, properties, and data sources
- **Ampli Developer Tools**: Type-safe code generation for implementing tracking plans with reduced errors
- **Visual Labeling**: Allows non-technical users to create labeled events by clicking on website elements without code changes
- **Branching Workflow**: Git-like branching system for collaborative tracking plan management

### Data Collection Methods
- **Client-side Tracking**: Browser SDK and Mobile SDKs for capturing user interactions directly from applications
- **Server-side Tracking**: Server SDKs and HTTP APIs for backend event tracking
- **Autocapture**: Automatic collection of user interactions (clicks, page views, form submissions) with minimal setup
- **Shopify/WordPress Plugins**: Pre-built integrations for common platforms

### Data Management
- **Metadata Enrichment**: Add descriptions, display names, and categories to events and properties
- **Property Groups**: Collections of properties that can be applied to multiple events simultaneously
- **Data Transformations**: Retroactive modifications to correct implementation mistakes without changing code
- **Custom Events**: Combine multiple events with OR clauses to track related activities as a single event
- **Derived Properties**: Create new properties using formulas applied to existing properties
- **Lookup Tables**: Enrich events by mapping property values to additional data from imported CSV files

### Data Quality and Governance
- **Schema Validation**: Configure how to handle unexpected data (unplanned events, properties, values)
- **Data Observe**: Real-time monitoring of events against tracking plans to identify issues
- **AI Data Assistant**: Automatically generates suggestions for tracking plan improvements
- **Data Access Control**: Restrict access to sensitive data through permission groups
- **Time-to-Live (TTL)**: Control data retention periods at organization and project levels

### Data Integration
- **Event Streaming**: Share behavioral data with external tools and platforms
- **Cohort Synchronization**: Export user segments to third-party destinations
- **Cross-Project Analysis**: Combine multiple source projects into a single portfolio view
- **Profiles**: Join customer profile data from data warehouses with behavioral product data

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Event Types
- **Events**: User actions or system occurrences tracked in Amplitude
- **Custom Events**: Virtual events that combine multiple existing events
- **Transformed Events**: Modified versions of events with corrections or enhancements
- **Unexpected Events**: Events not defined in the tracking plan

### Property Types
- **Event Properties**: Attributes specific to individual events
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes associated with users
- **Group Properties**: Attributes associated with organizational groupings
- **Derived Properties**: Computed properties created from existing properties
- **Lookup Properties**: Properties enriched through lookup tables

### Data Sources
- **Client-side Sources**: Code running on user devices (mobile/web apps)
- **Server-side Sources**: Code running on servers
- **Third-party Sources**: External platforms integrated with Amplitude

### Data Management Concepts
- **Tracking Plan**: Specification of expected events and properties
- **Schema Violations**: Deviations from the defined tracking plan
- **Property Groups**: Reusable collections of properties
- **Branches**: Isolated environments for tracking plan changes
- **Environments**: Separate contexts (production/development) for testing

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Data integrates with the broader Amplitude platform:

1. **Amplitude Analytics**: Data collected and managed through Amplitude Data powers analytics features like funnels, cohorts, and user behavior analysis
2. **Amplitude Experiment**: Clean, well-structured data improves experiment analysis
3. **Amplitude CDP**: Enables accurate audience targeting based on quality data
4. **Session Replay**: Enhanced with properly tracked events for better context

Amplitude Data also connects with external tools:
- **Data Warehouses**: Snowflake, Databricks, and S3 for Profiles integration
- **Marketing Platforms**: Cohort synchronization with tools like Braze and AppsFlyer
- **Development Tools**: Jira integration for tracking implementation tasks
- **CMS Platforms**: WordPress and Shopify plugins

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

### Taxonomy API
Enables programmatic management of taxonomy elements:
- `GET /api/2/taxonomy/categories`
- `POST /api/2/taxonomy/categories`
- `GET /api/2/taxonomy/event-types`
- `POST /api/2/taxonomy/event-types`
- `GET /api/2/taxonomy/properties`
- `POST /api/2/taxonomy/properties`

### Batch Event Upload API
Used for data backfills with considerations:
- Throttling limit: 300 events per second per device ID
- Daily limit: 500K events
- Use `$skip_user_properties_sync: true` for historical imports

### SDK Implementation Options
- **Browser SDK**: JavaScript/TypeScript implementation with Autocapture capabilities
- **Mobile SDKs**: iOS Swift SDK and Android-Kotlin SDK
- **Server SDKs**: Various language implementations for backend tracking
- **Ampli CLI**: Command-line tool for tracking plan implementation
  - `ampli pull`: Fetch latest tracking plan
  - `ampli status`: Check implementation status

### Chrome Extension
The Amplitude Instrumentation Explorer helps debug SDK implementations by:
- Capturing and displaying triggered events in real-time
- Showing event parameters and configuration options
- Allowing filtering and copying of event data

Amplitude Data provides a comprehensive suite of tools for ensuring high-quality analytics data throughout the entire data lifecycle, from planning and collection to management and integration.
