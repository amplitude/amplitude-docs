Amplitude Data is a comprehensive data governance and management platform that provides tools for planning, implementing, and maintaining analytics instrumentation across web and mobile applications. The platform serves as a centralized data catalog that enables organizations to create structured tracking plans, generate type-safe code, and monitor data quality in real-time.

## Core Product Architecture

Amplitude Data operates as the governance layer for Amplitude's analytics ecosystem, built around several interconnected components:

**Tracking Plans** serve as the foundational schema definition system, allowing teams to define events, event properties, user properties, and group properties in a structured format. These plans support branching workflows similar to Git, enabling collaborative development with features like merge requests, team reviews, and environment-specific deployments.

**Ampli Developer Tools** generate type-safe, auto-generated tracking libraries from tracking plans, providing compile-time validation and autocompletion for developers. The Ampli CLI (`ampli pull`, `ampli status --is-merged`) integrates with existing development workflows to ensure instrumentation consistency.

**Data Ingestion and Validation** occurs through multiple pathways including client-side SDKs (Browser, Android, iOS, Unity, Flutter, React Native), server-side SDKs (Node.js, Go, Python, Java), and third-party integrations. The platform supports both HTTP V2 API and Batch Event Upload API endpoints for different ingestion patterns.

## Key Features and Capabilities

**Schema Management** provides comprehensive control over data structure through configurable schema violation handling. Organizations can choose to either "Mark As Unexpected" or "Reject" three types of violations: unplanned event types, unplanned properties, and unplanned property values.

**Data Transformation and Enhancement** includes several powerful features:
- **Derived Properties** enable retroactive property creation using formulas with functions like REGEXEXTRACT, SPLIT, CONCAT, and DATE_TIME_FORMATTER
- **Custom Events** combine multiple existing events with OR clauses for flexible analysis
- **Lookup Tables** enrich data by mapping CSV imports (up to 100MB/1M rows) to existing properties
- **Transformations** allow retroactive data structure modifications including event merging, property renaming, and value hiding

**Real-time Monitoring and Observability** through the Observe feature automatically validates incoming events against tracking plans, categorizing them as Unexpected, Valid, Invalid, or Out of Date. The platform provides source attribution, property type validation, and environment-specific filtering.

## Data Access and Security

**Data Access Control (DAC)** enables Enterprise organizations to classify properties as PII, revenue, or sensitive data, with group-based permissions through the Groups framework. Restrictions apply across charts, cohorts, dashboards, exports, and the Taxonomy API.

**Data Mutability** supports INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations through Mirror Sync strategies across Snowflake (CDC), Databricks (CDF), and Amazon S3 integrations, enabling compliance with GDPR and CCPA requirements.

## Integration Ecosystem

**Source Integrations** include native SDKs, third-party platforms (Segment, mParticle, Tealium), cloud storage imports (Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage), and specialized plugins for WordPress and Shopify that provide advanced autocapture capabilities.

**Destination Streaming** enables real-time behavioral data forwarding to downstream tools with 60-second p95 latency targets, exponential backoff retry mechanisms, and configuration-based filtering. The platform supports streaming of transformed events including Custom Events, Derived Properties, and Transformed Properties.

**Cohort Synchronization** provides three sync cadences: one-time, scheduled (hourly/daily), and real-time (every minute) to third-party destinations including ad networks and marketing automation platforms.

## Advanced Analytics Features

**Cross-Project Analysis** through portfolios combines up to 5 source projects with schema ranking for conflict resolution. **Currency Conversion** provides multi-currency revenue analysis using ISO 4217 currency codes and ExchangeRate API integration. **Channels** create retroactive property classifiers based on UTM and referrer data for acquisition tracking.

**Autocapture** automatically captures user interactions (clicks, page views, sessions, form interactions) across Browser SDK, iOS Swift SDK, and Android-Kotlin SDK with visual labeling capabilities and privacy protections for sensitive elements.

## API and Developer Tools

The **Taxonomy API** enables CRUD operations for categories, event types, event properties, and user properties. The **Chrome Extension Debugger** provides real-time instrumentation debugging with event parameter viewing and SDK configuration access.

**Time-to-Live (TTL)** configuration manages data retention at organization and project levels with daily deletion jobs. **CSV Import/Export** functionality supports bulk tracking plan management with detailed field schemas and branching workflows.

The platform integrates with development workflows through **Jira Integration** for automatic issue creation on feature branch changes, and supports **Git Integration** for tracking plan versioning and deployment management.

Amplitude Data represents a comprehensive solution for organizations requiring enterprise-grade data governance, combining planning tools, real-time validation, flexible transformation capabilities, and extensive integration options within a collaborative, version-controlled environment.
