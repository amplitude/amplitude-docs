**Summary:** Amplitude's Data Access Control (DAC) feature enables Enterprise organizations to manage access to sensitive data by classifying properties as PII, revenue, or sensitive data and controlling group-based permissions through the Groups framework, with restrictions applying to charts, cohorts, dashboards, notebooks, user sessions, exports, and the Taxonomy API.
