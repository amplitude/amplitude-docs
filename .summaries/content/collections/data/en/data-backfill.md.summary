## Summary
This documentation covers Amplitude's data backfill process using the Batch Event Upload API, including ingestion limits (500K events per device ID daily, 100 batches/1000 events per second), user property sync behavior with `$skip_user_properties_sync` flag, and best practices for importing historical data while maintaining data integrity.
