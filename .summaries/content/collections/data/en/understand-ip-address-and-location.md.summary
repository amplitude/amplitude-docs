## Summary
This documentation explains how Amplitude automatically tracks and processes IP addresses, location properties, user agent strings, and device information, including the use of MaxMind database for GeoIP lookups, server-side location property overrides via HTTP API, IP address filtering while preserving location data, and automatic user agent parsing to extract device properties like device_brand, os_name, browser, and platform across client-side SDKs.
