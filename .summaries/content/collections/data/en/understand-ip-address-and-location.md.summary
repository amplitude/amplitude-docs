# Summary
This documentation explains how Amplitude tracks location properties using MaxMind's GeoIP database to determine user location from IP addresses (even when IPs are blocked), and how it automatically parses user agent strings to extract device and platform information (device model, OS, browser, etc.) which are added as properties to events for analysis.
