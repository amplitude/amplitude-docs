# Summary
This documentation explains Amplitude Data's transformations feature, which allows retroactive modification of event data to correct implementation mistakes without changing the underlying code base. It details how to merge events, event properties, and user properties, rename property values, hide property values, and manage transformations, noting that transformations occur at query time and don't affect raw data.
