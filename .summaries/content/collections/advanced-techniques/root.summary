Amplitude Experiment is a comprehensive feature flagging and A/B testing platform designed for organizations to run controlled experiments and manage feature rollouts at scale. The platform combines sophisticated traffic allocation mechanisms with advanced statistical analysis capabilities, supporting both local and remote evaluation modes to accommodate different performance and targeting requirements.

## Product Architecture and Core Features

The platform operates through dual evaluation modes: local evaluation flags that execute client-side or server-side with minimal latency, and remote evaluation flags that provide enhanced targeting capabilities. The system supports multiple SDK implementations including JavaScript Server SDK (@amplitude/experiment-node-server), JavaScript Client SDK (@amplitude/experiment-js-client), and specialized server-side rendering configurations.

Traffic management operates through several key mechanisms: sticky bucketing ensures consistent variant assignments across user sessions, mutual exclusion groups prevent interaction effects between related experiments, and holdout groups enable measurement of long-term cumulative program impact. The platform supports advanced deployment patterns through flag prerequisites that create dependencies between experiments, and proxy configurations using AWS CloudFront for bypassing domain restrictions.

## Statistical Analysis and Data Quality Framework

Amplitude Experiment provides sophisticated statistical analysis through multiple hypothesis testing with Bonferroni correction to control family-wise error rates across multiple variants and metrics. The platform includes comprehensive outlier detection and resolution techniques using statistical methods like winsorization, standard deviations analysis, and log transforms optimized for different metric types including totals, sum of property, average of property, and funnel metrics.

Sample ratio mismatch (SRM) detection helps identify and debug allocation issues, while cumulative exposure analysis provides insights into experiment health through slope analysis, divergent line interpretation, and inflection point identification. Advanced metric use cases include funnel analysis integration where exposure events occur mid-funnel and threshold metrics requiring multiple event occurrences.

## Key Technical Integration Points

The platform exposes critical API endpoints including `/v1/vardata` for variant data retrieval and experiment evaluation. Server-side rendering is supported through combined SDK usage, with server initialization using `ExperimentServer.fetchV2()` and client initialization with pre-fetched variants through `initialVariants` configuration.

For low-code implementations, the platform supports URL redirect testing through script tag integration in the `<head>` section, enabling A/B testing without developer involvement while requiring the Amplitude Analytics SDK for event tracking and measurement.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Sticky Bucketing**: Mechanism ensuring users receive consistent variant assignments across sessions and experiments
**Mutual Exclusion Groups**: Traffic allocation system preventing users from participating in conflicting experiments simultaneously
**Holdout Groups**: Control populations excluded from experiments to measure cumulative program impact
**Flag Prerequisites**: Dependency system allowing experiments to be conditional on other flag states
**Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM)**: Statistical test detecting unexpected traffic allocation imbalances
**Cumulative Exposure Analysis**: Method for analyzing experiment health through user assignment patterns over time
**Winsorization**: Statistical technique for handling outliers by capping extreme values at specified percentiles

## Enterprise Capabilities and Ecosystem Integration

Enterprise plans unlock advanced features including flag prerequisites for creating experiment dependencies, holdout groups for program-level impact measurement, and enhanced mutual exclusion group capabilities. The platform integrates deeply with Amplitude Analytics through shared event tracking, cohort targeting, and cross-platform chart settings import/export via JSON schema.

Traffic allocation operates through sophisticated bucketing mechanisms using Device ID or Amplitude ID as bucketing keys, with support for dynamic cohort targeting and real-time traffic distribution adjustments. The system maintains data quality through comprehensive debugging tools including Experiment Assignment event tracking, cumulative assignment charts, and integration with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem including session replays and Microscope for detailed user behavior analysis.

The platform fits within Amplitude's broader product ecosystem as the experimentation layer, leveraging the analytics platform's user identification, event tracking, and behavioral data to power sophisticated targeting and measurement capabilities while feeding experiment results back into the analytics platform for comprehensive impact analysis.
