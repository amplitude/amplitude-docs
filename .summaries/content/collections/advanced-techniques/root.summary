Amplitude Experiment is a comprehensive feature flagging and A/B testing platform designed for enterprise-scale experimentation programs. The platform enables organizations to run controlled experiments, manage feature rollouts, and conduct sophisticated statistical analysis with advanced traffic management capabilities.

## Core Architecture and Evaluation Modes

The platform operates through two primary evaluation paradigms:

**Local Evaluation**: Performs variant assignment on the client or server side using cached configuration data. This mode offers superior performance but with limited targeting capabilities, using Device ID as the bucketing key for consistent user assignment.

**Remote Evaluation**: Makes real-time API calls to Amplitude's evaluation servers (`api.lab.amplitude.com` and `api.lab.eu.amplitude.com`) for variant assignment. This mode provides full feature set access including advanced targeting, using Amplitude ID as the bucketing key.

The system supports seamless migration between evaluation modes and enables server-side rendering through dual SDK implementation, combining the JavaScript Server SDK (`@amplitude/experiment-node-server`) with the JavaScript Client SDK (`@amplitude/experiment-js-client`).

## Advanced Traffic Management System

**Sticky Bucketing**: Implements deterministic hashing algorithms to maintain consistent variant assignments even when experiment parameters change. This prevents variant jumping that could compromise statistical validity, ensuring users remain in assigned variants despite modifications to targeting criteria, percentage rollout, or rollout weights.

**Mutual Exclusion Groups**: Prevents users from participating in multiple related experiments simultaneously through slot-based traffic allocation. Experiments compete for user assignment within defined traffic percentages, avoiding interaction effects and data contamination.

**Holdout Groups**: Excludes specified user percentages from experiments entirely, enabling measurement of cumulative experimentation program lift. When experiments belong to multiple holdout groups, traffic reduction becomes multiplicative (e.g., 0.95 × 0.95 = 90.25% remaining traffic).

**Flag Prerequisites**: Creates dependency chains where dependent flags require prerequisite flags to have specific variant values, enabling complex experiment orchestration and sequential feature rollout management.

## Statistical Analysis and Data Quality Framework

**Bonferroni Correction**: Automatically adjusts p-values for multiple hypothesis testing scenarios, controlling family-wise error rates when testing multiple variants or metrics. This correction applies to both primary metrics with multiple treatments and secondary metrics across multiple comparisons.

**Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM) Detection**: Identifies deviations between actual and expected traffic allocation ratios, indicating potential instrumentation errors, mid-experiment changes, or bucketing issues. The system provides cumulative assignment charts and exposure event analysis for diagnostic purposes.

**Outlier Detection and Mitigation**: Employs statistical methods including standard deviations, boxplots, and percentiles, with resolution strategies like winsorization and log transforms tailored to different metric types (totals, sum of property, average of property, funnel metrics).

## Advanced Metrics and Analysis Capabilities

**Funnel Analysis Integration**: Enables creation of conversion funnels where exposure events occur mid-funnel, supporting post-exposure metric counting and variant filtering capabilities for sophisticated conversion analysis.

**Threshold Metrics**: Requires multiple event occurrences before counting conversions, providing more nuanced success criteria beyond simple binary conversion events.

**Cumulative Exposure Analysis**: Interprets exposure patterns through slope analysis (increasing for steady growth, decreasing for slowing rates), divergent line identification (indicating staggered rollouts or novelty effects), and inflection point detection (suggesting traffic allocation changes or targeting modifications).

## Key Technical Integration Points

**API Endpoints**:
- `/v1/vardata` endpoint for variant data retrieval and testing
- AWS CloudFront reverse proxy configuration for bypassing domain blocking
- JSON import/export functionality for experiment chart settings

**Data Schema**: Supports structured configuration including variants, bucketingGroupType, userProperty, metrics, and exposureEvent fields for comprehensive experiment definition.

**URL Redirect Testing**: Enables A/B testing through visitor redirection without developer involvement, using script tag implementation in the `<head>` section and requiring Amplitude Analytics SDK integration.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Bucketing Keys**: Unique identifiers used for consistent user assignment (Device ID for local evaluation, Amplitude ID for remote evaluation)

**Variant Assignment**: The process of determining which experiment variation a user receives based on deterministic hashing algorithms

**Exposure Events**: Tracking events that indicate when a user has been exposed to an experiment variant

**Statistical Significance**: Confidence level that observed differences between variants are not due to random chance

**Family-Wise Error Rate**: The probability of making one or more false discoveries when performing multiple hypothesis tests

## Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Experiment integrates deeply with Amplitude Analytics for comprehensive event tracking, user segmentation, and conversion analysis. The platform forms a core component of Amplitude's broader digital optimization ecosystem, with enterprise plans unlocking advanced capabilities including holdout groups, mutual exclusion groups, flag prerequisites, and sophisticated statistical features.

The system supports complex analytical scenarios including post-exposure counting, variant jumping handling, and experiment flag key filtering, making it suitable for organizations requiring enterprise-grade experimentation infrastructure with rigorous statistical controls and advanced traffic management capabilities.
