# Amplitude Experiment: Advanced Techniques

## Product Overview

Amplitude Experiment is a feature experimentation and flag management platform that enables teams to test new features, conduct A/B tests, and manage feature rollouts. The platform supports both local and remote evaluation modes, providing flexibility across client and server environments. Key capabilities include experiment creation, variant assignment, traffic allocation, user targeting, and results analysis.

The platform excels in supporting sophisticated experimentation use cases through advanced techniques like holdout groups, mutual exclusion groups, and flag prerequisites. These capabilities allow teams to design complex experiment architectures while maintaining statistical validity and user experience consistency.

## Product Relationships and Features

### Core Components

1. **Feature Flags and Experiments**
   - **Local Evaluation Flags**: Client-side evaluation using device ID as the bucketing key
   - **Remote Evaluation Flags**: Server-side evaluation supporting complex targeting rules
   - **Flag Prerequisites**: Dependency relationships between flags where one flag's evaluation depends on another's state

2. **User Targeting and Traffic Allocation**
   - **Holdout Groups**: Mechanism to exclude specific user percentages from experiments
   - **Mutual Exclusion Groups**: Prevents users from participating in multiple related experiments
   - **Sticky Bucketing**: Ensures consistent variant assignment despite targeting changes

3. **Implementation Methods**
   - **Server-Side Rendering**: Combined JavaScript Server SDK and Client SDK implementation
   - **Split URL Testing**: No-code A/B testing through URL redirects
   - **Proxy Configurations**: AWS CloudFront integration as a reverse proxy for evaluation servers

4. **Analysis and Metrics**
   - **Advanced Metric Use Cases**: Funnel analysis based on experiment metrics
   - **Outlier Detection**: Methods to identify and handle statistical outliers
   - **Multiple Hypothesis Testing**: Statistical corrections for experiments with multiple variants/metrics

5. **Experiment Monitoring**
   - **Cumulative Exposure Analysis**: Tools to interpret exposure graphs and identify issues
   - **Sample Ratio Mismatch Detection**: Identifies discrepancies between expected and actual variant allocations

### Integration with Amplitude Analytics

Amplitude Experiment integrates with Amplitude Analytics to provide:
- Importing/exporting experiment chart settings between platforms
- Creating user segments based on experiment variants for funnel analysis
- Using Analytics data to inform experiment targeting and analysis

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Evaluation Modes**
   - **Local Evaluation**: Client-side variant assignment using deterministic hashing
   - **Remote Evaluation**: Server-side variant assignment with complex targeting rules

2. **Bucketing Concepts**
   - **Bucketing Key**: Identifier used to assign users to variants (typically device ID or user ID)
   - **Sticky Bucketing**: Mechanism to maintain consistent variant assignment for users
   - **Variant Jumping**: Undesirable situation where users see different variants during an experiment

3. **Experiment Analysis Terms**
   - **Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM)**: Statistically significant difference between observed and expected variant allocations
   - **Multiple Hypothesis Testing**: Running multiple statistical tests that increase false positive risk
   - **Bonferroni Correction**: Statistical method to adjust for multiple comparisons

4. **Exposure and Assignment**
   - **Exposure Event**: Tracks when a user actually sees a variant
   - **Assignment Event**: Records which variant a user is assigned to
   - **Cumulative Exposures Graph**: Visualization showing exposure accumulation over time

5. **Advanced Configuration Types**
   - **Holdout Groups**: User segments excluded from experiments to measure long-term impacts
   - **Mutual Exclusion Groups**: Configuration to prevent users from participating in multiple related experiments
   - **Flag Prerequisites**: Dependencies between flags where one flag's evaluation depends on another's state

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Experiment functions within the broader Amplitude product ecosystem:

1. **Amplitude Analytics Integration**

   - Support for CMS integration through split URL testing
   - Enterprise features for large-scale deployment (holdout groups, mutual exclusion)

## API Endpoints and Implementation Details

1. **SDK Initialization**
   ```javascript
   // Server SDK initialization
   const experiment = new ExperimentServer({
     apiKey: 'SERVER_API_KEY',
     serverUrl: 'https://api.lab.amplitude.com'
   });

   // Client SDK initialization
   const experimentClient = new ExperimentClient({
     apiKey: 'CLIENT_API_KEY',
     user: { user_id: 'user-id' },
     initialVariants: initialVariants // From server
   });
   ```

2. **Variant Fetching**
   ```javascript
   // Server-side variant fetching
   const variants = await experiment.fetchV2({
     user: { user_id: 'user-id' }
   });

   // Client-side variant access
   const variant = experimentClient.variant('flag-key').value;
   ```

3. **Split URL Testing Implementation**
   ```html
   <script src="https://cdn.amplitude.com/libs/experiment-js-client/1.0.0/experiment.umd.js"></script>
   <script>
     const experiment = new amplitude.Experiment.ExperimentClient({
       apiKey: 'CLIENT_API_KEY',
       configuration: {
         evaluationMode: 'local'
       }
     });
   </script>
   ```

4. **Flag Prerequisites Configuration**
   - Enterprise feature requiring specific configuration in the Amplitude Experiment UI
   - Prevents circular dependencies and ensures proper evaluation order

5. **Holdout Group and Mutual Exclusion Configuration**
   - Enterprise features configured through the Amplitude Experiment UI
   - Require careful traffic allocation planning to ensure sufficient sample sizes
