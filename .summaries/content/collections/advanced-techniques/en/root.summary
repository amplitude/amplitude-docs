## Amplitude Experiment Advanced Techniques

Amplitude Experiment is a comprehensive feature flagging and A/B testing platform that enables organizations to run sophisticated experiments and manage feature rollouts. The advanced techniques documentation covers complex experimentation scenarios, statistical analysis methods, and enterprise-level features for optimizing experiment design and data quality.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

The platform operates through multiple interconnected components that work together to provide a complete experimentation solution:

**Core Evaluation Infrastructure:**
- **Local vs Remote Evaluation**: Experiments can run in local evaluation mode (using Device ID bucketing for faster performance) or remote evaluation mode (with full targeting capabilities)
- **Server and Client SDKs**: The platform supports both server-side rendering through `@amplitude/experiment-node-server` and client-side implementation via `@amplitude/experiment-js-client`
- **Evaluation Endpoints**: Primary API endpoints include `/v1/vardata` for variant data retrieval

**Traffic Management System:**
- **Mutual Exclusion Groups**: Prevent users from being exposed to multiple related experiments simultaneously to avoid interaction effects
- **Holdout Groups**: Exclude specified user percentages from experiments to measure long-term cumulative impact and experimentation program lift
- **Sticky Bucketing**: Maintains consistent variant assignments even when targeting criteria or rollout percentages change

**Advanced Experiment Types:**
- **Split URL Testing**: Enables A/B testing through URL redirects without developer involvement
- **Flag Prerequisites**: Creates dependencies between feature flags where evaluation requires prerequisite flags to have specific variant values

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Bucketing and Assignment:**
- **Bucketing Key**: The identifier used for user assignment (Device ID for local evaluation, Amplitude ID for remote)
- **Variant Jumping**: When users switch between experiment variants due to configuration changes
- **Sticky Bucketing**: Feature that prevents variant jumping by maintaining consistent assignments
- **Traffic Allocation**: Percentage of users exposed to experiments, can be multiplicative across multiple holdout groups

**Statistical Analysis:**
- **Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM)**: Deviation from expected variant allocation ratios, indicating potential data quality issues
- **Multiple Hypothesis Testing**: Statistical challenge addressed through Bonferroni correction for family-wise error rate control
- **Cumulative Exposures**: Time-series graphs showing user exposure patterns with various slope interpretations
- **Inflection Points**: Changes in exposure graph slopes indicating traffic allocation or targeting modifications

**Metrics and Measurement:**
- **Exposure Events**: Tracking when users encounter experiment variants, can be custom or assignment-based
- **Threshold Metrics**: Require multiple event occurrences before counting conversions
- **Funnel Analysis**: Experiment metrics integrated into conversion funnel measurement
- **Winsorization**: Outlier mitigation technique available in Enterprise plans

**Data Quality and Analysis:**
- **Outlier Detection**: Statistical methods including standard deviations, boxplots, and percentiles
- **Log Transforms**: Mathematical transformations for handling skewed data distributions
- **FREQPERCENTILE, PROPSUM, TOTALS Formulas**: Amplitude-specific calculation methods for different metric types
