Amplitude Experiment is a comprehensive feature flagging and A/B testing platform that enables organizations to run controlled experiments and manage feature rollouts at scale. The platform provides both local and remote evaluation modes, sophisticated traffic allocation mechanisms, and advanced statistical analysis capabilities for measuring experiment impact.

## Core Product Architecture and Features

The platform operates through multiple evaluation modes - local evaluation flags that execute client-side or server-side with minimal latency, and remote evaluation flags that provide more sophisticated targeting capabilities. Users can create experiments using various SDKs including JavaScript Server SDK (@amplitude/experiment-node-server), JavaScript Client SDK (@amplitude/experiment-js-client), and specialized implementations for server-side rendering scenarios.

Key traffic management features include sticky bucketing for consistent variant assignments, mutual exclusion groups to prevent interaction effects between related experiments, and holdout groups for measuring long-term cumulative program impact. The platform supports advanced deployment patterns through flag prerequisites that create dependencies between experiments, and proxy configurations using AWS CloudFront for bypassing domain restrictions.

## Statistical Analysis and Data Quality

Amplitude Experiment provides sophisticated statistical analysis through multiple hypothesis testing with Bonferroni correction to control family-wise error rates across multiple variants and metrics. The platform includes comprehensive outlier detection and resolution techniques using statistical methods like winsorization, standard deviations analysis, and log transforms for different metric types including totals, sum of property, average of property, and funnel metrics.

Sample ratio mismatch (SRM) detection helps identify and debug allocation issues, while cumulative exposure analysis provides insights into experiment health through slope analysis, divergent line interpretation, and inflection point identification. Advanced metric use cases include funnel analysis integration where exposure events occur mid-funnel and threshold metrics requiring multiple event occurrences.

## Key API Endpoints and Technical Integration

The platform exposes several critical endpoints including `/v1/vardata` for variant data retrieval and experiment evaluation. Server-side rendering is supported through combined SDK usage, with server initialization using `ExperimentServer.fetchV2()` and client initialization with pre-fetched variants through `initialVariants` configuration.

For low-code implementations, the platform supports URL redirect testing through script tag integration in the `<head>` section, enabling A/B testing without developer involvement while requiring the Amplitude Analytics SDK for event tracking.

## Enterprise Capabilities and Ecosystem Integration

Enterprise plans unlock advanced features including flag prerequisites for creating experiment dependencies, holdout groups for program-level impact measurement, and enhanced mutual exclusion group capabilities. The platform integrates deeply with Amplitude Analytics through shared event tracking, cohort targeting, and cross-platform chart settings import/export via JSON schema.

The system maintains data quality through comprehensive debugging tools including Experiment Assignment event tracking, cumulative assignment charts, and integration with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem including session replays and Microscope for detailed user behavior analysis. Traffic allocation operates through sophisticated bucketing mechanisms using Device ID or Amplitude ID as bucketing keys, with support for dynamic cohort targeting and real-time traffic distribution adjustments.
