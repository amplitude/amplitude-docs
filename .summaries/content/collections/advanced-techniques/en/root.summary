Amplitude Experiment is a comprehensive feature flagging and A/B testing platform that enables organizations to run controlled experiments and manage feature rollouts at scale. The platform provides sophisticated statistical analysis capabilities, flexible evaluation modes, and advanced traffic management features for enterprise experimentation programs.

## Core Product Architecture

Amplitude Experiment operates through two primary evaluation modes: **local evaluation** and **remote evaluation**. Local evaluation flags perform variant assignment on the client or server side using cached configuration, while remote evaluation flags make real-time API calls to Amplitude's evaluation servers. The platform supports seamless migration between these modes, with local evaluation offering better performance but limited targeting capabilities compared to remote evaluation's full feature set.

The system uses **bucketing keys** (Device ID for local evaluation, Amplitude ID for remote evaluation) to ensure consistent user assignment across sessions. Server-side rendering is supported through dual SDK implementation, combining the JavaScript Server SDK (@amplitude/experiment-node-server) for initial variant fetching with the JavaScript Client SDK (@amplitude/experiment-js-client) for seamless client-side experience.

## Advanced Traffic Management

**Sticky bucketing** maintains consistent variant assignments even when experiment parameters change, preventing variant jumping that could compromise statistical validity. This deterministic hashing algorithm ensures users remain in their assigned variants despite modifications to targeting criteria, percentage rollout, or rollout weights.

**Mutual exclusion groups** prevent users from participating in multiple related experiments simultaneously, avoiding interaction effects and data contamination. These groups use slot-based traffic allocation where experiments compete for user assignment within defined traffic percentages.

**Holdout groups** exclude specified user percentages from experiments entirely, enabling measurement of cumulative experimentation program lift and long-term impact analysis. When experiments belong to multiple holdout groups, traffic reduction becomes multiplicative (e.g., 0.95 × 0.95 = 90.25% remaining traffic).

**Flag prerequisites** create dependency chains where evaluation of dependent flags requires prerequisite flags to have specific variant values, enabling complex experiment orchestration and feature rollout sequences.

## Statistical Analysis and Data Quality

The platform implements **Bonferroni correction** for multiple hypothesis testing, automatically adjusting p-values when testing multiple variants or metrics to control family-wise error rates. This correction applies to both primary metrics with multiple treatments and secondary metrics across multiple comparisons.

**Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM) detection** identifies when actual traffic allocation deviates from expected ratios, indicating potential instrumentation errors, mid-experiment changes, or bucketing issues. Cumulative assignment charts and exposure event analysis help diagnose these data quality problems.

**Outlier detection and mitigation** uses statistical methods including standard deviations, boxplots, and percentiles, with resolution strategies like winsorization and log transforms for different metric types (totals, sum of property, average of property, funnel metrics).

## Advanced Metrics and Analysis

**Funnel analysis integration** enables creation of conversion funnels where exposure events occur mid-funnel, with post-exposure metric counting and variant filtering capabilities. **Threshold metrics** require multiple event occurrences before counting conversions, providing more sophisticated success criteria.

**Cumulative exposure analysis** interprets exposure patterns through slope changes (increasing for steady growth, decreasing for slowing rates), divergent lines (indicating staggered rollouts or novelty effects), and inflection points (suggesting traffic allocation changes or targeting modifications).

## Key API Endpoints and Integration Points

- `/v1/vardata` endpoint for variant data retrieval and testing
- `api.lab.amplitude.com` and `api.lab.eu.amplitude.com` evaluation servers
- AWS CloudFront reverse proxy configuration for bypassing domain blocking
- JSON import/export functionality for experiment chart settings with schema including variants, bucketingGroupType, userProperty, metrics, and exposureEvent fields

## Specialized Features

**URL redirect testing** enables A/B testing through visitor redirection to different URLs without developer involvement, using script tag implementation in the `<head>` section and requiring Amplitude Analytics SDK for event tracking.

**Advanced metric use cases** support complex analytical scenarios including post-exposure counting, variant jumping handling, and experiment flag key filtering for sophisticated statistical analysis.

The platform integrates deeply with Amplitude Analytics for comprehensive event tracking, user segmentation, and conversion analysis, forming part of Amplitude's broader digital optimization ecosystem. Enterprise plans unlock additional capabilities including holdout groups, mutual exclusion groups, flag prerequisites, and advanced statistical features.
