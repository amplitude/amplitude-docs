## Amplitude Experiment Advanced Techniques

Amplitude Experiment is a comprehensive feature flagging and A/B testing platform that enables sophisticated experimentation workflows through advanced configuration options, statistical analysis capabilities, and enterprise-grade traffic management features. The platform supports both local and remote evaluation modes, provides robust statistical analysis with multiple hypothesis testing corrections, and offers advanced traffic allocation mechanisms including holdout groups and mutual exclusion groups.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

The advanced techniques documentation reveals a tightly integrated ecosystem where core experimentation features work together to enable complex testing scenarios:

**Evaluation Architecture**: The platform operates on dual evaluation modes - local evaluation flags for high-performance server-side deployments using Device ID bucketing, and remote evaluation flags for more flexible targeting using Amplitude ID. Migration between modes is supported with specific configuration workflows.

**Traffic Management Hierarchy**: Multiple traffic control mechanisms work in concert:
- **Holdout Groups** exclude percentage-based user segments from experiments to measure cumulative program impact
- **Mutual Exclusion Groups** prevent users from participating in multiple related experiments simultaneously
- **Flag Prerequisites** create dependency chains where experiment evaluation requires specific prerequisite flag states
- **Sticky Bucketing** maintains consistent variant assignments despite targeting or allocation changes

**Statistical Analysis Integration**: The platform integrates with Amplitude Analytics for comprehensive metric analysis, supporting advanced use cases like funnel analyses with mid-funnel exposure events, threshold metrics using funnel counting, and outlier detection with winsorization techniques.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Bucketing and Assignment**:
- **Bucketing Key**: Identifier used for variant assignment (Device ID for local evaluation, Amplitude ID for remote)
- **Sticky Bucketing**: Feature maintaining consistent variant assignments despite experiment changes
- **Variant Jumping**: Undesired behavior where users switch between variants, prevented by sticky bucketing
- **Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM)**: Statistical anomaly indicating uneven traffic distribution between variants

**Evaluation Modes**:
- **Local Evaluation**: Server-side flag evaluation with cached rules and Device ID bucketing
- **Remote Evaluation**: Real-time flag evaluation with full targeting capabilities and Amplitude ID bucketing

**Traffic Control Mechanisms**:
- **Holdout Groups**: User segments excluded from experiments to measure long-term impact
- **Mutual Exclusion Groups**: Traffic allocation system preventing simultaneous experiment participation
- **Flag Prerequisites**: Dependency system requiring specific prerequisite flag states for evaluation

**Statistical Analysis**:
- **Bonferroni Correction**: Multiple hypothesis testing adjustment controlling family-wise error rates
- **Winsorization**: Outlier mitigation technique capping extreme values at specified percentiles
- **Cumulative Exposures**: Time-series visualization showing experiment exposure patterns and traffic allocation

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Experiment operates as a central component within the broader Amplitude ecosystem, with deep integrations across multiple product areas:

**Analytics Integration**: Seamless data flow between Experiment and Analytics enables sophisticated metric analysis, with JSON import/export capabilities for chart settings and shared event tracking through the Analytics SDK. The platform supports advanced metric types including funnel analyses, threshold metrics, and outlier detection using statistical formulas like FREQPERCENTILE, PROPSUM, and TOTALS.

**Infrastructure Integration**: The platform supports enterprise deployment patterns including AWS CloudFront reverse proxy configurations for bypassing domain restrictions, server-side rendering implementations combining JavaScript Server and Client SDKs, and split URL testing for low-code experimentation workflows.

**Data Quality and Debugging**: Comprehensive debugging capabilities through Experiment Assignment events, cumulative exposure graph analysis for detecting traffic anomalies, and integration with Amplitude's Microscope tool for detailed event inspection.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Core Evaluation Endpoints**:
- `/v1/vardata` - Primary endpoint for variant data retrieval, used for testing CloudFront proxy configurations
- Server SDK initialization via `@amplitude/experiment-node-server` package
- Client SDK initialization via `@amplitude/experiment-js-client` package

**Key SDK Methods**:
- `ExperimentServer.fetchV2()` - Server-side variant fetching for SSR implementations
- `ExperimentClient.initialVariants` - Client-side initialization with pre-fetched variants
- JSON export/import functionality for experiment chart settings transfer

**Configuration APIs**:
- Dependencies card configuration for flag prerequisites
- Mutex and Holdouts tab for traffic management
- Bucketing delivery settings for sticky bucketing configuration

The platform requires specific implementation patterns for advanced use cases, such as Experiment SDK script tag placement in `<head>` sections for split URL testing, and coordinated server-client SDK usage for seamless server-side rendering experiences. Enterprise plans unlock additional capabilities including flag prerequisites, holdout groups, and advanced statistical analysis features.
