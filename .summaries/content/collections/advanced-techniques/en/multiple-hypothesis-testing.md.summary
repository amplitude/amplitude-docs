**Summary:** This documentation explains multiple hypothesis testing in Amplitude Experiment, covering the multiple comparisons problem and how Amplitude uses Bonferroni correction to control family-wise error rates when testing multiple variants or metrics, with automatic correction applied to primary metrics with multiple treatments and secondary metrics with multiple treatments or metrics.
