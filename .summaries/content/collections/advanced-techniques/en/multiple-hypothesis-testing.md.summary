# Summary
This documentation explains multiple hypothesis testing in Amplitude Experiment, detailing how adding multiple variants or metrics increases false positive risks, and how Amplitude uses the Bonferroni correction method to counteract this problem by dividing the false positive rate by the number of hypothesis tests being run.
