# Summary
Sticky bucketing in Amplitude Experiment ensures users consistently see the same variant even when experiment targeting criteria or rollout parameters change, helping prevent variant jumping. It's only available for feature experiments (not flags) and works by checking if a user already has a value for the experiment's user property before re-evaluating them.
