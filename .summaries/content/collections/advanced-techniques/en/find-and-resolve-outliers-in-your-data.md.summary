## Summary
This documentation explains how to identify and handle outliers in data analysis, covering methods like standard deviations, boxplots, and percentiles for detection, and techniques like winsorization, filtering, transformations, and visualization for mitigation across different metric types (totals, sum of property, average of property, funnels) in Amplitude Analytics and Experiment.
