## Summary
This documentation covers advanced techniques for identifying and resolving outliers in Amplitude Analytics data, including statistical methods (standard deviations, boxplots, percentiles), visualization approaches, and mitigation strategies like winsorization and log transforms for different metric types (totals, sum of property, average of property, funnel metrics) in both Analytics and Experiment products.
