## Summary
This documentation covers outlier detection and resolution techniques in Amplitude Analytics and Experiment, including statistical methods (standard deviations, boxplots, percentiles), visualization approaches (frequency charts, histograms), and mitigation strategies like winsorization and log transforms for different metric types (totals, sum of property, average of property, funnel metrics).
