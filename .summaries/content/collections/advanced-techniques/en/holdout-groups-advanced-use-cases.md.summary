**Summary:** This documentation covers advanced holdout group scenarios in Amplitude Experiment, specifically managing multiple holdout groups that compound traffic reduction (e.g., 0.95 * 0.95 = 90.25%) and combining holdout groups with mutual exclusion groups that further limit experiment traffic allocation.
