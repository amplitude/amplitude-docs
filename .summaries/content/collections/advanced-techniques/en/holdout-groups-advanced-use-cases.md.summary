**Summary:** This documentation covers advanced holdout group scenarios in Amplitude Experiment, specifically addressing traffic distribution issues when experiments belong to multiple holdout groups (resulting in multiplicative traffic reduction like 0.95 * 0.95 = 90.25%) and the interaction between holdout groups and mutual exclusion groups that can further limit experiment traffic allocation.
