## Summary
This documentation explains how to manage traffic allocation when using holdout groups in complex scenarios, specifically addressing the challenges of adding experiments to multiple holdout groups (which reduces available traffic) and combining holdout groups with mutual exclusion groups (which further limits experiment traffic).
