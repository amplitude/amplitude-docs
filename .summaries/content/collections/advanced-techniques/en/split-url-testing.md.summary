# Summary
Split URL testing in Amplitude allows marketers to conduct A/B tests by redirecting visitors to different URLs without extensive developer involvement, requiring only a script tag in the `<head>` section and the Amplitude Analytics SDK for event tracking, with configuration limits including local evaluation mode, user bucketing, deviceID keys, and all-users audience targeting.
