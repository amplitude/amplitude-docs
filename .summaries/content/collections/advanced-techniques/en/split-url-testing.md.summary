# Summary
Split URL testing in Amplitude allows marketers to conduct A/B tests by redirecting visitors to different URLs without extensive developer involvement, requiring only the Amplitude Experiment SDK script in the page's head section and the Analytics SDK for event tracking, with evaluation limited to local mode and user-level bucketing.
