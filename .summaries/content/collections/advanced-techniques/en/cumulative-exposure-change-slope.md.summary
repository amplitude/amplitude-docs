# Summary
This documentation explains the cumulative exposures graph in Amplitude Experiment, showing how to interpret increasing slopes (steady user acquisition) and decreasing slopes (slowing exposure rates over time), with potential causes for decreasing slopes including static cohorts, limited cohort growth, and user behavior changes.
