# Summary
This documentation explains how to interpret the cumulative exposures graph in Amplitude Experiment, focusing on increasing slopes (consistent user growth) and decreasing slopes (slowing exposure rates over time), including potential causes for decreasing slopes such as static cohorts, limited user pools, or changing user behavior patterns.
