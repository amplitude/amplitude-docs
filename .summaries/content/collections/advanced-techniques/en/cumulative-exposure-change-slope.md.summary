## Summary
This documentation explains how to interpret cumulative exposure graphs in Amplitude Experiment, specifically focusing on increasing slopes (steady growth) and decreasing slopes (slowing exposure rates over time), including causes like static cohorts and implications for experiment duration estimation.
