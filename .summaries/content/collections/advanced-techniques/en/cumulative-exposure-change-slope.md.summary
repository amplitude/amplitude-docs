# Summary
This documentation explains how to interpret the cumulative exposures graph in Amplitude Experiment, focusing on increasing slopes (consistent user growth) and decreasing slopes (slowing exposure rates over time), including causes like static cohorts, seasonality patterns, and implications for experiment duration calculations.
