**Summary:** This documentation explains how to interpret divergent lines in Amplitude's cumulative exposures graph for A/B testing experiments, covering scenarios with similar slopes (caused by staggered variant launches and novelty effects) and different slopes (caused by custom exposure events, cached variants, and sticky bucketing interactions with traffic allocation changes).
