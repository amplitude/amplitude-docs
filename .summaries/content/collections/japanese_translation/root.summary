# Amplitude Product Ontology and Summary (Japanese Translation)

## High-Level Overview

This directory contains Japanese translations of Amplitude's comprehensive digital analytics platform documentation. Amplitude is a product analytics ecosystem consisting of four core products:

- **Amplitude Analytics**: Event-based user behavior analysis and product intelligence
- **Amplitude Experiment**: A/B testing, feature flags, and experimentation platform  
- **Amplitude Data**: Data governance, tracking plans, and schema management
- **Amplitude Activation**: AI-powered personalization and audience targeting

The platform enables organizations to instrument event tracking, analyze user journeys through various chart types, conduct controlled experiments, and activate insights through personalized campaigns and recommendations.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

### Analytics Foundation Layer
Amplitude Analytics serves as the core data collection and analysis engine, providing multiple chart types for behavioral analysis:
- **Event Segmentation Charts**: Measure user actions and engagement patterns
- **Funnel Analysis**: Track conversion flows and identify drop-off points
- **Retention Charts**: Analyze user return behavior over time periods
- **User Session Analysis**: Session-based engagement and activity metrics
- **Revenue LTV**: Monetization tracking and customer lifetime value
- **Pathfinder/User Journey**: Visual user flow and navigation analysis
- **Compass**: Statistical correlation between events and retention outcomes

### Data Governance Layer
Amplitude Data provides the structural framework for data quality:
- **Tracking Plans**: Schema definition and event validation rules
- **Branches and Environments**: Version control for analytics implementations
- **Data Validation**: Real-time schema enforcement and violation reporting
- **Transformations**: Retroactive data structure modifications
- **Ampli SDK**: Type-safe, auto-generated tracking libraries from schemas

### Experimentation Platform
Amplitude Experiment integrates with Analytics for statistical hypothesis testing:
- **Feature Flags**: Progressive feature rollouts and remote configuration
- **A/B Testing**: Statistical experimentation with sequential and t-test methodologies
- **Mutual Exclusion Groups**: Experiment isolation to prevent interference
- **Sticky Bucketing**: Consistent user assignment across sessions and devices

### Activation and Personalization
Amplitude Activation leverages behavioral data for targeted engagement:
- **Behavioral Cohorts**: User segmentation based on action patterns
- **Predictive Cohorts**: Machine learning-powered future behavior prediction
- **Recommendations**: AI-driven content and product personalization
- **Destination Syncs**: Audience export to marketing and engagement platforms

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### User Identity Management
- **Amplitude ID**: Internal unified identifier merging device and user identities
- **Device ID**: Anonymous device identifier (IDFV, advertising ID, UUID)
- **User ID**: Custom identifier for authenticated user sessions
- **MTU (Monthly Tracked Users)**: Billing metric for unique active users per month

### Event Data Structure
- **Events**: Discrete user actions tracked in the system (e.g., "Purchase Completed", "Video Played")
- **Event Properties**: Contextual metadata for events (e.g., product_category, video_duration)
- **User Properties**: Persistent user attributes (e.g., subscription_tier, geographic_region)
- **Active Events**: User-initiated actions indicating engagement
- **Inactive Events**: System-generated events not representing user behavior

### Analytics Methodology
- **Cohorts**: User groups defined by shared characteristics or behavioral patterns
- **Segments**: Dynamic user filters based on properties and actions
- **Conversion Windows**: Time boundaries for measuring funnel completion rates
- **Retention Types**: "Return On" (exact day) vs "Return On or After" (any subsequent day)
- **Usage Intervals**: Frequency patterns and engagement cadence analysis

### Experimentation Framework
- **Variants**: Different experience versions (control group, treatment variations)
- **Exposure Events**: User encounters with experiment variants
- **Assignment Events**: User allocation to experimental groups
- **MDE (Minimum Detectable Effect)**: Smallest meaningful change threshold
- **Sequential Testing**: Continuous monitoring vs fixed-sample statistical approaches
