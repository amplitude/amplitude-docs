Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics platform designed to help product teams understand user behavior, optimize experiences, and drive business growth through data-driven insights and experimentation.

## Core Product Suite

The platform consists of four interconnected products that work together as a unified ecosystem:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the primary analytics engine, providing event-based tracking and visualization through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, and Cohort Analysis. It processes real-time data to generate actionable insights about user behavior patterns.

**Amplitude Data** functions as the data governance and tracking plan management system, ensuring data quality and consistency across all touchpoints. It provides centralized schema management, validation rules, and tracking plan specifications.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers A/B testing and feature flag management capabilities, enabling teams to test product changes and measure their impact on user behavior and business metrics.

**Amplitude Activation** powers personalization and user targeting through AI-driven recommendations and predictions, allowing teams to create tailored user experiences based on behavioral insights.

## Product Integration and Data Flow

The products operate through a layered architecture where data flows seamlessly between components:

The **Data Collection Layer** (Amplitude Data) manages tracking plans and governance, ensuring consistent event and property definitions across all products. The **Analytics Layer** (Amplitude Analytics) processes this data through various analysis tools and visualizations. The **Experimentation Layer** (Amplitude Experiment) leverages analytics data to power tests and feature flags, while the **Activation Layer** (Amplitude Activation) uses insights to drive personalized experiences.

Cross-product functionality includes shared cohorts that can be created in Analytics and used across Experiment and Activation, unified user identification systems, and real-time data streaming that enables immediate insights and personalization.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Data Concepts:**
- **Events**: Tracked user actions (e.g., "Button Clicked", "Page Viewed")
- **Properties**: Contextual attributes for events (Event Properties) or users (User Properties)
- **Amplitude ID**: Automatically generated unique user identifier
- **Device ID**: Device/browser-specific identifier
- **User ID**: Customer-defined identifier for known users

**Analytics Terminology:**
- **Active Users**: Users performing at least one active event in a time period
- **Cohorts**: User groups defined by shared characteristics or behaviors
- **Retention**: Measurement of user return behavior over time
- **Funnel**: Sequential user steps toward conversion goals
- **Segmentation**: Data breakdown by specific properties or user groups

**Data Management Terms:**
- **Tracking Plan**: Centralized specification of events and properties
- **Schema**: Data structure definitions with validation rules
- **Branches**: Isolated environments for testing tracking changes
- **Transformations**: Retroactive event data modifications

**Experimentation Concepts:**
- **Variants**: Different feature versions being tested
- **Exposure Events**: User interactions with experiment variants
- **Statistical Significance**: Confidence levels for result validity
- **Sticky Bucketing**: Consistent user variant assignment throughout experiments

## Ecosystem Integration and APIs

Amplitude integrates extensively with external platforms through multiple channels:

**SDK Support** includes native SDKs for iOS, Android, JavaScript, React Native, Flutter, Unity, and server-side SDKs for Node.js, Python, Java, Go, PHP, plus direct HTTP API access and partner integrations with Segment, mParticle, and Shopify.

**Third-Party Destinations** enable data synchronization with advertising platforms (Facebook, Google Ads, TikTok), email/marketing tools (Braze, Iterable, Mailchimp), data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift), and business intelligence platforms (Tableau, Looker, PowerBI).

**Enterprise Features** include Single Sign-On (SSO) with SAML 2.0, SCIM provisioning for automated user management, granular permission groups, cross-project analysis through Portfolio addon, and custom SQL queries via Amplitude Query.
