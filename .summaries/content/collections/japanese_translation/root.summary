## High-Level Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics platform that helps businesses understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of several integrated products that work together to collect, analyze, visualize, and act on user behavioral data.

Key features of Amplitude include:
- Event tracking and user behavior analysis
- Funnel and retention analysis
- Experimentation and A/B testing
- Personalization and targeting
- Data management and governance
- Cross-platform user journey tracking
- Predictive analytics and recommendations

## Product Relationships and Features

Amplitude's product ecosystem consists of several interconnected components:

1. **Amplitude Analytics** - The core analytics platform for visualizing and analyzing user behavior data through various chart types and dashboards.

2. **Amplitude Data** - A data management solution that helps define, track, and validate product analytics through tracking plans, schema management, and data quality tools.

3. **Amplitude Experiment** - An A/B testing and experimentation platform that enables testing product changes and measuring their impact on user behavior.

4. **Amplitude Activation** - A personalization platform that uses behavioral cohorts, predictions, and recommendations to drive one-to-one personalization.

The relationships between these products are as follows:
- **Amplitude Data** feeds clean, structured data into **Amplitude Analytics** for visualization and analysis.
- **Amplitude Analytics** provides insights that inform hypotheses for **Amplitude Experiment**.
- **Amplitude Experiment** results are analyzed in **Amplitude Analytics** to understand impact.
- **Amplitude Activation** uses insights from **Amplitude Analytics** and behavioral patterns to create personalized experiences.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Data Structure
- **Events**: User actions tracked in Amplitude (e.g., "Song Played", "Purchase Completed")
- **Event Properties**: Attributes of events that provide context (e.g., song genre, purchase amount)
- **User Properties**: Attributes of users that persist across sessions (e.g., country, language)
- **Group Properties**: Attributes of organizations or accounts for B2B analysis
- **Amplitude ID**: Unique identifier assigned to each user by Amplitude
- **Device ID**: Identifier for a specific device
- **User ID**: Custom identifier assigned by the customer's application

### Analytics Concepts
- **Cohorts**: Groups of users who share common behaviors or properties
- **Funnels**: Sequential series of events that track user conversion paths
- **Retention**: Measurement of how many users return to perform specific actions
- **Stickiness**: Measurement of how frequently users perform specific actions
- **Sessions**: Periods of continuous user activity
- **Active Users**: Users who have performed at least one active event in a given time period
- **Monthly Tracking Users (MTU)**: Unique users tracked in a calendar month (used for billing)

### Experiment Terminology
- **Variants**: Different versions of a feature being tested
- **Control Group**: Baseline version for comparison in experiments
- **Holdout Group**: Users excluded from experiments
- **Exposure Events**: Events that indicate a user has been exposed to an experiment
- **Statistical Significance**: Confidence level that observed differences are not due to chance

### Activation Concepts
- **Predictive Cohorts**: User segments based on likelihood to perform future actions
- **Recommendations**: Suggested items or actions for users based on behavioral patterns
- **Computations**: Custom user properties derived from user behavior
- **Synchronizations**: Connections that send cohorts to third-party platforms

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's products integrate with each other and with external systems in the following ways:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - SDKs for various platforms (JavaScript, iOS, Android, etc.)
   - HTTP API for server-side tracking
   - Integrations with data sources like Segment, mParticle, and Rudderstack

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Transformation features for retroactive data structure changes
   - Derived properties for creating new properties from existing ones
   - Lookup tables for enriching event and user properties

3. **Data Analysis**:
   - Chart types for different analysis needs (Event Segmentation, Funnels, Retention, etc.)
   - Dashboards for organizing related charts
   - Notebooks for collaborative analysis and storytelling

4. **Data Activation**:
   - Cohort synchronization to marketing platforms
   - Profile API for real-time personalization
   - Webhook integrations for custom workflows

5. **Cross-Product Features**:
   - Spaces for organizing and sharing analytics work
   - Team collaboration tools like comments and sharing
   - Governance features for data quality and access control
