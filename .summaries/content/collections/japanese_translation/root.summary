## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### User Identification
- **Device ID**: Unique identifier for a device (IDFA, IDFV, AdID, or custom)
- **User ID**: Custom identifier assigned to logged-in users
- **Amplitude ID**: Amplitude's internal identifier that links Device IDs and User IDs

### Event Tracking
- **Events**: User actions tracked in the system (e.g., "Page View", "Button Click")
- **Event Properties**: Attributes of events (e.g., "Button Color", "Page Name")
- **User Properties**: Attributes of users (e.g., "Country", "Plan Type")
- **Group Properties**: Attributes of organizations or accounts
- **Active Events**: Events triggered by direct user actions
- **Inactive Events**: Events not triggered by direct user actions (e.g., notifications)

### Analysis Concepts
- **Cohorts**: Groups of users who share common behaviors or properties
- **Funnels**: Sequential steps users take toward conversion
- **Retention**: Measurement of users returning to the product over time
- **Stickiness**: Frequency of user engagement with the product
- **Sessions**: Periods of continuous user activity
- **Monthly Tracking Users (MTU)**: Unique users tracked in a calendar month (billing metric)

### Data Management
- **Tracking Plan**: Documentation of events and properties to be tracked
- **Schema Violations**: Unexpected event types, properties, or property values
- **Branches**: Isolated environments for tracking plan changes
- **Property Groups**: Sets of properties that can be applied across multiple events
