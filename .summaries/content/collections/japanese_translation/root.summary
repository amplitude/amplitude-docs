Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics platform that provides product teams with tools for understanding user behavior, conducting experiments, and optimizing product experiences. The platform consists of several interconnected products that work together to deliver end-to-end analytics capabilities.

## Core Products

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics platform, enabling teams to track user behavior through event-based analytics. It provides various chart types for analyzing user journeys, conversion funnels, retention patterns, and engagement metrics. The platform supports real-time data visualization and offers advanced features like behavioral cohorts, custom formulas, and cross-project analysis.

**Amplitude Data** functions as the data governance and management layer, providing tracking plan creation, schema validation, and data quality controls. It includes features for event taxonomy management, property definitions, and data transformation capabilities.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers A/B testing and feature flag functionality, allowing teams to run controlled experiments and manage feature rollouts. It integrates statistical analysis tools including sequential testing and T-tests for measuring experiment impact.

**Amplitude Activation** (formerly Audiences) provides AI-powered personalization capabilities through behavioral cohorts, predictive analytics, recommendations, and automated campaign targeting.

## Key Features and Concepts

The platform operates on an event-based analytics model where user interactions are tracked as discrete events with associated properties. Users are identified through a combination of device IDs, user IDs, and Amplitude's internal Amplitude ID system, enabling cross-device and cross-platform tracking.

**Chart Types**: The platform offers specialized chart types for different analytical needs:
- Event Segmentation for analyzing user actions and trends
- Funnel Analysis for conversion tracking
- Retention Analysis for measuring user return behavior
- Pathfinder/Journey charts for understanding user flows
- Lifecycle charts for user base growth analysis
- Revenue LTV for monetization tracking

**Behavioral Cohorts** enable dynamic user segmentation based on actions performed within specified timeframes, supporting both real-time and historical analysis.

**Experiments and Feature Flags** provide controlled testing environments with statistical significance calculations, variant management, and rollout controls.

## Product Relationships and Integration

### Data Flow Architecture

The products integrate through a unified data architecture where Amplitude Data serves as the schema management layer, Analytics provides the visualization and analysis capabilities, Experiment handles controlled testing, and Activation delivers personalization based on analytical insights.

**Data Sources**: Multiple ingestion methods including SDKs (JavaScript, iOS, Android, React Native), HTTP APIs, and third-party integrations (Segment, mParticle, Shopify).

**Data Destinations**: Export capabilities to external platforms including Snowflake, Redshift, S3, and various marketing/advertising platforms through synchronization features.

### Cross-Product Workflows

Teams typically follow workflows that span multiple products:
1. Define tracking plans in Amplitude Data
2. Implement instrumentation using SDKs or APIs
3. Analyze user behavior in Amplitude Analytics
4. Create experiments in Amplitude Experiment
5. Build personalization campaigns in Amplitude Activation

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### User Identification
- **Device ID**: Platform-specific identifier (IDFV on iOS, random UUID on web)
- **User ID**: Custom identifier set by the application
- **Amplitude ID**: Internal identifier that merges anonymous and identified user sessions

### Event Structure
- **Events**: User actions tracked in the system (e.g., "Button Clicked", "Page Viewed")
- **Event Properties**: Contextual attributes of events (e.g., button_name, page_url)
- **User Properties**: Attributes describing users (e.g., subscription_type, location)

### Analytics Concepts
- **MTU (Monthly Tracked Users)**: Billing metric based on unique users per calendar month
- **Active Events**: User-initiated actions that count toward active user metrics
- **Inactive Events**: System-generated events that don't count toward active users
- **Sessions**: Periods of user activity with configurable timeout windows

### Experimentation Terms
- **Variants**: Different versions of features being tested
- **Exposure Events**: When users see experiment variants
- **Assignment Events**: When users are allocated to experiment groups
- **Statistical Significance**: Confidence level in experiment results (typically 95%)

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

### Enterprise Features
The platform provides enterprise-grade capabilities including:
- **SSO Integration**: SAML 2.0 support for Auth0, Okta, Azure AD, G Suite
- **Permission Management**: Role-based access controls and permission groups
- **Data Governance**: Schema validation, data quality monitoring, and compliance tools

### Developer Ecosystem
- **Ampli**: Code generation tool for type-safe event tracking
- **APIs**: Comprehensive REST APIs for data ingestion, export, and management
- **Webhooks**: Real-time notifications for monitors and alerts

### Third-Party Integrations
- **Analytics Platforms**: Segment, mParticle for data routing
- **Collaboration Tools**: Slack, Notion, Miro, Jira for workflow integration
- **Identity Providers**: Enterprise SSO solutions
- **Data Warehouses**: Snowflake, Redshift for data export

## API Endpoints and Command Line Tools

### Key API Endpoints

- **Export API**: For bulk data extraction
- **Identify API**: For user property updates
- **Group Identify API**: For account-level properties
- **Attribution API**: For mobile attribution events
- **Taxonomy API**: For programmatic schema management

### Command Line Tools
- **Ampli CLI**: 
  - `ampli pull` - Download tracking plan
  - `ampli status` - Validate implementation
  - `ampli push` - Update tracking plan

### SDK Methods
- **Event Tracking**: `logEvent()`, `logRevenueV2()`
