# Summary
This documentation explains how to set up Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE) for experiments in Amplitude, emphasizing that MDE represents the smallest change you want to detect. It covers how to determine appropriate MDE values based on experiment type (Hypothesis Testing vs. Do No Harm), primary metrics, and associated risks, with practical examples showing how business goals influence MDE settings.
