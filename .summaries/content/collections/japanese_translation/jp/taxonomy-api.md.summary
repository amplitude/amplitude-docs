# Summary
The Taxonomy API allows creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of categories, event types, event properties, and user properties in Amplitude, with the limitation that only planned events/properties can be edited, not those with existing data. Customers need to contact their Customer Service Manager or Amplitude Support to use this API.
