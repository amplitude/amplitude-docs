### Summary
This documentation explains multiple hypothesis testing in Amplitude Experiments, detailing how adding multiple variants or metrics increases false positive risks. It describes the Bonferroni correction method implemented by Amplitude to control family-wise error rates when testing multiple hypotheses, applying corrections to both primary and secondary metrics based on the number of treatments and metrics.
