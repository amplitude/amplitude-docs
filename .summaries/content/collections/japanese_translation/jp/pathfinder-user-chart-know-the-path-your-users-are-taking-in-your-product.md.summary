**Summary:** This documentation covers Amplitude's legacy Pathfinder User Chart feature for analyzing user paths and event sequences in products, including configuration with start/end events, session-based tracking, property expansion, and user segmentation - noting it's being merged into the new Journeys experience and doesn't support custom events in Amplitude 2.0.
