# Summary
This documentation explains how Amplitude Experiment uses sequential testing (specifically mixed sequential probability ratio tests or mSPRT) for statistical inference in A/B testing, highlighting its advantages over t-tests. Sequential testing allows valid results viewing at any time without increasing false positives, enabling earlier experiment completion with fewer observations compared to fixed-horizon methods.
