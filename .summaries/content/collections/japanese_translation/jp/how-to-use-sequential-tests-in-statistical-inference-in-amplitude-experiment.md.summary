## Summary
This documentation explains how Amplitude Experiment uses sequential testing (specifically mixed Sequential Probability Ratio Tests - mSPRT) for statistical inference in A/B testing, comparing it to traditional t-tests and covering implementation details for unique, sum, and property sum metrics with specific exposure and conversion thresholds.
