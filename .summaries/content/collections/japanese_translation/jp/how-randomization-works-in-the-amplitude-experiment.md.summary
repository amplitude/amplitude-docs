# Summary
This documentation explains Amplitude Experiment's deterministic randomization process, which uses a two-stage approach: first determining if a user is included in an experiment based on rollout rate (using a murmur3 hash of "bucketingSalt/id"), then assigning users to specific variants based on variant weights using the same hash value.
