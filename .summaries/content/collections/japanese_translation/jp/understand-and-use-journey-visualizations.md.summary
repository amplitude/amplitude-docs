**Summary:** This Japanese documentation explains journey visualizations in Amplitude Analytics, covering three chart types: Pathfinder (default flow diagram showing user paths), Journey Map (conversion timing and friction analysis), and Top User Paths (ranked path frequency analysis). The page details path reading methodology, event filtering, property expansion, conversion windows, and differences from legacy Pathfinder and Journey chart logic.
