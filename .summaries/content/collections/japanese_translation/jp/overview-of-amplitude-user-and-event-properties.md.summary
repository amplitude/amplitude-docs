## Summary
This documentation explains Amplitude's two types of properties: user properties (attributes of individual users that persist until changed) and event properties (attributes specific to events at the time they occur). It details how Amplitude updates and applies these properties, including the timing considerations for property updates and how they appear in analytics charts.
