## Summary
This documentation explains Amplitude's two types of properties: user properties (attributes of individual users that persist until changed) and event properties (attributes specific to events at the time they occur). It details how Amplitude updates and applies user properties, explains that property values reflect the time of event occurrence, and describes methods for applying user properties to events.
