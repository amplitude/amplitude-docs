## Summary
This documentation covers Amplitude's account-level reporting feature using the Accounts addon, which enables group-level analytics instead of individual user-level reporting by implementing groups (accounts, order IDs, charts) with event-level or user-level definitions, dynamic group properties, and integration with Salesforce for B2B analytics.
