**Summary:** This Japanese FAQ documentation explains Amplitude's A/B test statistical calculations, including Bayesian methods for calculating likelihood above baseline using error functions (erf) and normal distribution assumptions, plus two-sided t-tests with 5% false positive rate and minimum sample size requirements (30 samples, 5 conversions, 5 non-conversions per variant) for statistical significance determination.
