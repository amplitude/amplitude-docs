# Summary
This documentation explains data discrepancies between Amplitude charts, Snowflake/Redshift, and Export API, primarily due to timezone differences where Amplitude charts reflect project timezone settings while Snowflake and Export API use UTC. When comparing data across platforms, users must ensure they're comparing equivalent queries and understand that Export API date ranges are based on server upload time.
