**Summary:**
This documentation explains how to interpret cumulative exposure graphs in Amplitude Experiment, covering graph components (x-axis showing first exposure dates, y-axis showing cumulative exposed users), common patterns like inflection points from traffic allocation changes, decreasing slopes from static cohorts, flattened slopes from seasonal usage, and diverging variant lines from staggered rollouts or sticky bucketing issues.
