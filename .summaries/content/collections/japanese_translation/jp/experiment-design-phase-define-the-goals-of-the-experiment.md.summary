**Summary:** This Japanese documentation explains how to define experiment goals in Amplitude Experiment's design phase, covering exposure event selection (Amplitude Exposure vs custom), primary/secondary metrics configuration, experiment types (hypothesis testing vs do-no-harm), minimum detectable effect settings, and metric creation/editing workflows.
