## Summary
This documentation explains Amplitude Experiment's sticky buckets feature, which ensures users continue to see the same variant even when experiment targeting criteria or rollout percentages change. It details how sticky buckets work, when to use them, when to avoid them, and how to verify if they're active for specific users through Event Stream analysis.
