## Summary
This documentation provides an overview of Amplitude Experiment, a behavior-driven experimentation platform that enables product teams to optimize user experiences through A/B testing, progressive feature delivery, and dynamic in-product experiences using feature flags. It explains the workflow for creating experiments (including hypothesis formation, metric selection, and variant creation) and feature flags for controlled rollouts.
