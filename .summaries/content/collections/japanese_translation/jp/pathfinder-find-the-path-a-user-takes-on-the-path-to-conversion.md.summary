## Summary
This documentation explains the Pathfinder chart in Amplitude, which visualizes user flows through a product by displaying event sequences (paths) users take toward conversion. It shows how to configure the chart with starting/ending events, filters, segmentation options, and how to interpret the resulting Sankey diagram and funnel visualization to understand user behavior patterns.
