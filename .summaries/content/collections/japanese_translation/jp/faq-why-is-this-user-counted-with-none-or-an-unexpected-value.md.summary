## Summary
This documentation explains why users may be counted with "(none)" or unexpected values in Amplitude analytics, detailing how event and user properties are captured at the time of event occurrence rather than reflecting current values. It covers null values in event properties, custom user properties, location properties determined by GeoIP, and device properties.
