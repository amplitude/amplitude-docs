## Summary
This documentation explains why users may be counted with "(none)" or unexpected values in Amplitude analytics, detailing how event and user properties are captured at event time and not retroactively updated. It covers null values in custom properties, location properties determined by GeoIP, and device properties that may appear as "(none)" due to implementation timing or missing mappings.
