## Summary
This documentation explains Amplitude's Historical Count feature, which allows tracking user behavior based on the nth instance of specific actions (up to 5 times). It helps identify friction points for first-time users and analyze differences in behavior between users who perform critical actions once versus multiple times, with specific application in Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Pathfinder, and Retention Analysis charts.
