## Summary
This documentation explains how Amplitude tracks unique users using a combination of Device ID, User ID, and Amplitude ID. It details how these identifiers work together to accurately count unique users across different scenarios, including anonymous browsing, multi-device usage, and user login/logout patterns, as well as how Amplitude handles user merging when it determines that multiple Amplitude IDs belong to the same user.
