# Summary
This page explains how to configure schema settings in Amplitude to handle schema violations, which occur when the platform receives unexpected data. It details three types of violations (unplanned event types, unplanned properties, and unplanned property values) and the available response options for each (accept and add to schema, trigger warning, or reject data).
