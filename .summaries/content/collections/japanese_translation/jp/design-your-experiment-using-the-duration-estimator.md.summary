## Summary
This documentation explains how to use Amplitude Experiment's duration estimator tool to plan experiment sample size and runtime needed to achieve statistical significance. It covers the tool's components (confidence level, control mean, standard deviation, power, test type, and MDE), how to interpret results, and strategies for reducing experiment runtime when estimates are longer than desired.
