# Summary and Keywords

**Summary:** This documentation explains how Amplitude Experiment estimates experiment duration to achieve statistical significance, detailing how the feature works, why estimates might not appear, the meaning of best/average/worst case scenarios, and potential errors in the estimation process. The feature is only available for primary metrics and sequential testing, using control and variant means, variances, and exposures to calculate the prediction.
