- **User Identification** (Amplitude ID, Device ID, User ID) is consistent across the platform
- **Real-time data streaming** enables immediate insights and personalization

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Core Concepts
- **Events**: User actions tracked in the product (e.g., "Button Clicked", "Page Viewed")
- **Properties**: Attributes that provide context to events (Event Properties) or describe users (User Properties)
- **Amplitude ID**: Unique identifier automatically generated for each user
- **Device ID**: Identifier for specific devices/browsers
- **User ID**: Custom identifier set by the customer to track known users

### Analytics Terms
- **Active Users**: Users who performed at least one active event in a given time period
- **Cohorts**: Groups of users defined by shared characteristics or behaviors
- **Retention**: Measurement of users returning to perform actions over time
- **Funnel**: Sequential steps users take toward a conversion goal
- **Segmentation**: Breaking down data by specific properties or user groups

### Data Management
- **Tracking Plan**: Centralized specification of all events and properties to be collected
- **Schema**: Structure defining expected data types and validation rules
- **Branches**: Isolated environments for testing tracking plan changes
- **Transformations**: Retroactive modifications to event data structure

### Experimentation
- **Variants**: Different versions of a feature being tested
- **Exposure Events**: When users are shown an experiment variant
- **Statistical Significance**: Confidence level that results are not due to chance
- **Sticky Bucketing**: Ensuring users remain in the same variant throughout an experiment
