# Amplitude Product Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics platform that helps businesses understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of several integrated products that work together to provide a complete analytics and experimentation solution.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Analytics Core

Amplitude Analytics is the foundation of the platform, allowing users to track, visualize, and analyze user behavior across digital products. Key features include:

- **Event Segmentation**: Analyze specific user actions with detailed filtering and segmentation capabilities
- **Funnel Analysis**: Track user progression through defined conversion paths and identify drop-off points
- **Retention Analysis**: Measure how users return to products over time with flexible time intervals
- **Pathfinder**: Visualize the paths users take through products to understand common journeys
- **Journeys**: Discover why users convert or drop off by analyzing paths between funnel steps
- **Lifecycle**: Track user base growth by categorizing users as new, current, returning, or dormant
- **Compass**: Identify behaviors that predict retention by analyzing correlations between actions and long-term engagement
- **Impact Analysis**: Track how initial feature engagement affects subsequent user behavior

### Amplitude Data

Amplitude Data provides centralized tracking plan management and data governance:

- **Tracking Plans**: Define, validate, and enforce consistent event collection across teams and platforms
- **Schema Management**: Control data types, descriptions, and validation rules for events and properties
- **Branches and Environments**: Create parallel development workflows with separate environments
- **Property Groups**: Define reusable property sets that can be applied across multiple events
- **Derived Properties**: Create new properties retroactively from existing ones using transformations
- **Data Filtering**: Block or drop invalid data through various filtering mechanisms

### Amplitude Experiment

A complete A/B testing and feature flagging platform:

- **Experiment Design**: Create hypotheses, define metrics, and set up variants
- **Feature Flags**: Control feature rollouts with targeted user segments
- **Statistical Analysis**: Analyze results with robust statistical methods including sequential testing
- **Sticky Buckets**: Ensure users see consistent experiences even when experiment parameters change
- **Mutual Exclusion Groups**: Prevent users from participating in multiple experiments simultaneously

### Amplitude Activation

A self-service personalization platform:

- **Behavioral Cohorts**: Create user segments based on actions and properties
- **Predictions**: Use AI to forecast user behavior and create predictive cohorts
- **Recommendations**: Generate personalized recommendations for users
- **Third-party Synchronization**: Send audience data to external platforms

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Events**: User actions tracked in Amplitude (e.g., "Page Viewed", "Button Clicked")
- **Event Properties**: Attributes of specific events (e.g., "page_name", "button_type")
- **User Properties**: Attributes of users that persist across sessions (e.g., "country", "plan_type")
- **Amplitude ID**: Unique identifier assigned to each user by Amplitude
- **Device ID**: Identifier for a specific device or browser
- **User ID**: Custom identifier assigned by the product to identify logged-in users
- **Monthly Tracking Users (MTU)**: Unique users who trigger events within a calendar month (used for billing)
- **Cohorts**: Groups of users who share common behaviors or attributes
- **Spaces**: Organizational units for storing and sharing analytics content
- **Projects**: Containers for organizing analytics by product or app section

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's products are designed to work together in an integrated workflow:

1. **Data Collection**: Implement tracking using SDKs, APIs, or integrations
2. **Data Management**: Define and validate tracking plans in Amplitude Data
3. **Analysis**: Explore user behavior in Amplitude Analytics
4. **Experimentation**: Test hypotheses with Amplitude Experiment
5. **Personalization**: Deploy targeted experiences with Amplitude Activation

The platform also integrates with numerous third-party tools through:

- **Data Sources**: Import data from platforms like Segment, Rudderstack, and custom sources
- **Data Destinations**: Export data to tools like Snowflake, BigQuery, and marketing platforms
- **Integrations**: Connect with tools like Slack, Jira, Miro, and Atlassian products

## API Endpoints and Implementation

### Key API Endpoints

- **HTTP API**: `/2/httpapi` for sending events
- **Identify API**: `/identify` for updating user properties
- **Export API**: For exporting raw event data
- **Cohort API**: For programmatically managing cohorts
- **User Privacy API**: For handling data deletion requests
- **SCIM API**: For user provisioning (Enterprise plan)
- **Profile API**: For accessing user profiles and recommendations

### SDK Implementation

Amplitude provides SDKs for various platforms:

- JavaScript/TypeScript for web applications
- iOS and Android for mobile applications
- Server-side SDKs for backend implementations
- Ampli wrapper for type-safe tracking based on tracking plans

### Implementation Best Practices

- Separate production and development environments with different API keys
- Implement proper user identification across platforms
- Follow consistent naming conventions for events and properties
- Use property groups for standardizing common properties
- Validate implementation with instrumentation explorers and debuggers

Amplitude's platform is designed to scale from small startups to enterprise organizations, with different plan tiers (Starter/Scholarship, Growth, Enterprise) offering varying levels of features, data volume limits, and support options.
