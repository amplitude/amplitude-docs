# Amplitude Product Ontology and Summary

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics platform that provides product analytics, experimentation, and customer data management capabilities. The platform consists of several interconnected products:

- **Amplitude Analytics**: Core product analytics platform for event-based user behavior analysis
- **Amplitude Experiment**: A/B testing and feature flag management platform
- **Amplitude Data**: Data governance and tracking plan management system
- **Amplitude Activation**: AI-powered personalization and audience targeting platform

The platform enables organizations to instrument event tracking, analyze user behavior through various chart types, run controlled experiments, and activate insights through personalized campaigns and recommendations.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

### Core Analytics Foundation
Amplitude Analytics serves as the foundational layer, providing event-based analytics through various chart types:
- **Event Segmentation**: Track user actions and measure engagement
- **Funnel Analysis**: Analyze conversion paths and drop-off points
- **Retention Analysis**: Measure user return behavior over time
- **User Session Charts**: Analyze session-based engagement metrics
- **Revenue LTV**: Track monetization and lifetime value
- **Pathfinder/Journey**: Visualize user flow paths
- **Compass**: Identify correlation between events and retention

### Data Management Layer
Amplitude Data provides the governance framework:
- **Tracking Plans**: Define and validate event schemas
- **Branches and Environments**: Version control for analytics implementations
- **Data Validation**: Schema enforcement and violation handling
- **Transformations**: Retroactive data structure modifications
- **Ampli SDK**: Type-safe tracking libraries generated from tracking plans

### Experimentation Platform
Amplitude Experiment integrates with Analytics for statistical testing:
- **Feature Flags**: Progressive feature delivery and rollouts
- **A/B Testing**: Hypothesis testing with sequential and t-test statistical methods
- **Mutual Exclusion Groups**: Prevent experiment interference
- **Sticky Bucketing**: Consistent user assignment across sessions

### Activation and Personalization
Amplitude Activation leverages Analytics data for targeting:
- **Behavioral Cohorts**: User segmentation based on actions
- **Predictive Cohorts**: AI-powered future behavior prediction
- **Recommendations**: ML-driven content personalization
- **Third-party Syncs**: Audience export to marketing platforms

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### User Identification
- **Amplitude ID**: Internal unique identifier merging device and user IDs
- **Device ID**: Anonymous device identifier (IDFV, UUID, etc.)
- **User ID**: Custom identifier for authenticated users
- **MTU (Monthly Tracked Users)**: Billing metric for unique users per month

### Event Structure
- **Events**: User actions tracked in the system (e.g., "Button Clicked", "Page Viewed")
- **Event Properties**: Contextual attributes of events (e.g., button_name, page_url)
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes of users (e.g., subscription_type, location)
- **Active Events**: Events that indicate user engagement
- **Inactive Events**: System events that don't represent user engagement

### Analytics Concepts
- **Cohorts**: Groups of users defined by shared characteristics or behaviors
- **Segments**: Filtered subsets of users based on properties
- **Conversion Window**: Time period for measuring funnel completion
- **Retention Types**: "Return On" (specific day) vs "Return On or After" (any day after)
- **Usage Intervals**: Frequency patterns of user engagement

### Experimentation Terms
- **Variants**: Different versions in an experiment (control, treatment)
- **Exposure Events**: When users see experiment variants
- **Assignment Events**: When users are allocated to variants
- **MDE (Minimum Detectable Effect)**: Smallest change worth detecting
- **Sequential Testing**: Continuous statistical monitoring vs fixed-sample t-tests
