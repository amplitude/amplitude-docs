## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Amplitude ecosystem is built around a unified data foundation where:

1. **Amplitude Data** serves as the central data governance layer, managing tracking plans, schemas, and data quality across all products
2. **Amplitude Analytics** provides the core analytical capabilities, consuming data managed by Amplitude Data
3. **Amplitude Experiment** leverages Analytics data for experiment analysis while maintaining independent user assignment logic
4. **Amplitude Activation** uses Analytics insights to create predictive cohorts and personalized recommendations

The products integrate through:
- Shared user identification systems (Amplitude ID, Device ID, User ID)
- Common event and property schemas managed in Amplitude Data
- Cross-product cohort sharing and synchronization
- Unified APIs and SDK implementations

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Concepts:**
- **Events** - User actions tracked in the system (active vs inactive events)
- **Properties** - Attributes describing events (event properties) or users (user properties)
- **Amplitude ID** - Unique identifier automatically assigned to users
- **Device ID** - Platform-specific device identifier (IDFV, ADID, etc.)
- **User ID** - Custom identifier set by developers for authenticated users
- **MTU (Monthly Tracked Users)** - Billing metric for unique users per calendar month

**Analytics Terms:**
- **Cohorts** - User segments defined by behavioral criteria or properties
- **Funnels** - Multi-step conversion analysis
- **Retention** - User return behavior analysis
- **Stickiness** - Frequency of user engagement
- **Segmentation** - Breaking down metrics by user or event properties

**Experimentation Terms:**
- **Variants** - Different versions in A/B tests
- **Exposure Events** - When users see experiment variations
- **Assignment Events** - When users are bucketed into experiments
- **Sticky Bucketing** - Consistent user assignment across experiment changes
- **Sequential Testing** - Statistical method for early experiment conclusions

**Data Management Terms:**
- **Tracking Plan** - Centralized schema defining events and properties
- **Branches** - Version control for tracking plan changes
- **Transformations** - Retroactive data structure modifications
- **Derived Properties** - Computed properties from existing data
