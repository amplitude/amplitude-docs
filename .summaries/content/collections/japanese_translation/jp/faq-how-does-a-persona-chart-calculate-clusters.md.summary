# Summary
Amplitude's Persona Chart clustering transitioned from K-means to Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to better handle outliers and high-dimensional data, enabling more effective identification of user behavior patterns by projecting data into a more interpretable "behavioral space" and normalizing event counts to reduce outlier influence.
