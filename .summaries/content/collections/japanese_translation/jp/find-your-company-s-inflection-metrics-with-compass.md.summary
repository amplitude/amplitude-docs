## Summary
This documentation explains how to use Amplitude Compass to identify "inflection metrics" - key behavioral thresholds that predict user retention or conversion. It details how to interpret Compass metrics including threshold-exceeding ratios, positive predictive value (PPV), sensitivity, negative predictive value (NPV), and specificity to find the optimal balance for identifying meaningful inflection points.
