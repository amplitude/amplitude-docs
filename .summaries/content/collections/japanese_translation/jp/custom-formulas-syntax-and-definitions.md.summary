## Summary
This documentation explains custom formulas in Amplitude's Event Segmentation charts, covering syntax and definitions for 20+ formula types including metrics formulas (ACTIVE, AVG, TOTALS, UNIQUES, HIST, PERCENTILE, PROPSUM, etc.), aggregation formulas (ROLLAVG, ROLLWIN, CUMSUM), and function formulas (TRENDLINE, EXP, LOG, POWER, SQRT). It details how to reference events by letters, use arithmetic operations, group by properties, compare cohorts, and format results as percentages or currency.
