## Summary

This documentation page explains custom formulas in Amplitude's Event Segmentation charts, covering syntax, definitions, and usage of 20+ formula functions including metrics formulas (ACTIVE, AVG, TOTALS, UNIQUES, HIST, FREQPERCENTILE, PERCENTILE, PROPSUM, PROPAVG, PROPHIST, PROPCOUNT, PROPCOUNTAVG, PROPMAX, PROPMIN, REVENUETOTAL, ARPAU), aggregation formulas (ROLLAVG, ROLLWIN, ROLLWINBEFORE, CUMSUM), and function formulas (TRENDLINE, EXP, LOG, LOG10, LN, POWER, SQRT). The page details how to reference events using letters, perform arithmetic operations, group by properties, compare cohorts using segment numbers, and format results with percentage/dollar prefixes.
