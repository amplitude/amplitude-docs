## Summary

This documentation page explains custom formulas in Amplitude's Event Segmentation charts, covering syntax, definitions, and usage of 20+ formula functions including metrics formulas (ACTIVE, AVG, TOTALS, UNIQUES, HIST, PERCENTILE, PROPSUM, etc.), aggregation formulas (ROLLAVG, ROLLWIN, CUMSUM), and mathematical function formulas (TRENDLINE, EXP, LOG, POWER, SQRT). The page details how to reference events using letters, perform arithmetic operations, group by properties, compare cohorts, and format results as percentages or currency.
