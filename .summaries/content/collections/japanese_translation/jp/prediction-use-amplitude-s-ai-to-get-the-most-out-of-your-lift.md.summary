## Summary
This documentation explains Amplitude's Prediction feature, which uses AI to segment users based on their likelihood to perform future actions, helping optimize targeting workflows for maximum lift. It details when predictions are most effective (for products with unclear funnels, when seeking incremental lift, and with 100,000+ monthly users), how to determine which predictions to build, and explains the mathematical model that analyzes user behavior patterns.
