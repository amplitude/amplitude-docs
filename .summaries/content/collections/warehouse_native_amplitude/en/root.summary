Warehouse-native Amplitude (WNA) is a data analytics solution that enables organizations to perform custom analyses directly on their Snowflake data warehouse without ingesting event data into Amplitude's platform. This approach allows companies to leverage their existing data infrastructure while accessing Amplitude's analytical capabilities through read-only connections.

## Core Features and Capabilities

WNA supports multiple data model types including Events (fact tables), User properties (current and historical), Group properties (current and historical), and Event properties (dimensional tables). The platform accommodates flexible data modeling approaches, allowing either one event per table or multiple events within a single table structure. Users can create models through Table Selection for direct table mapping or SQL Query options for custom data transformations.

The system integrates with modern data engineering workflows through DBT integration, utilizing manifest files with `amplitude_meta` annotations to create and update multiple data models simultaneously. Additionally, bulk model management capabilities enable batch operations using YAML configuration files for efficient model deployment and maintenance.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The warehouse-native approach creates a direct bridge between Snowflake data warehouses and Amplitude's analytics engine. Data models serve as the foundational layer, with fact tables containing event data and dimensional tables providing contextual properties. The platform maintains a single connection per project limitation, ensuring focused data access while supporting various schema design patterns including star and snowflake configurations.

The relationship between components follows a hierarchical structure where warehouse connections enable project creation, projects contain multiple data models, and data models define the analytical datasets available for exploration. Each model requires specific mandatory fields including unique IDs and timestamp columns (TIMESTAMP_NTZ format) for proper data correlation and temporal analysis.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Data Model Types:**
- EVENT: Fact tables containing behavioral event data
- EVENT_PROPERTIES: Dimensional data associated with specific events
- CURRENT_USER_PROPERTIES: Latest user attribute values
- HISTORICAL_USER_PROPERTIES: Time-series user attribute changes
- CURRENT_GROUP_PROPERTIES: Latest group/account attribute values
- HISTORICAL_GROUP_PROPERTIES: Time-series group attribute changes

**Technical Components:**
- **Identity Spaces**: User identification frameworks for data correlation
- **MTU Count**: Monthly Tracked Users counting methodology
- **Clustering Keys**: Database optimization using LINEAR() function for event time
- **Special Columns**: Required field mappings (unique_id, event_time, start_time, end_time, event_type)

**Configuration Objects:**
- **DataModel**: Primary configuration entity for model definition
- **FieldMapping**: Column mapping specifications between warehouse and Amplitude
- **tableConfig/sqlConfig**: Selection methods for data source definition
- **multiEventConfig**: Configuration for multiple events within single tables

## Product Ecosystem Integration

WNA operates within Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem while maintaining data sovereignty in customer warehouses. The platform generates optimized queries that execute directly against Snowflake instances, returning results to Amplitude's visualization and analysis interfaces. This architecture supports existing Amplitude features with specific limitations on advanced formulas (HIST, PERCENTILE, ROLLWINBEFORE, CUMSUM, ACTIVE, ARPAU) and certain chart types.

The integration supports modern data engineering practices through DBT workflows, enabling version-controlled model definitions and automated deployment pipelines. Service account configurations ensure secure, read-only access while clustering key optimizations enhance query performance for analytics workloads.

## API and Configuration Methods

Model creation and management occur through multiple interfaces:

**YAML Configuration**: Bulk model management using structured configuration files with apiVersion `warehouse/models/v1`, supporting batch create and update operations across multiple model types simultaneously.

**DBT Integration**: Manifest file processing with `amplitude_meta` annotations embedded in DBT model definitions, enabling infrastructure-as-code approaches to model management.

**Direct Configuration**: Interactive model creation through Amplitude's interface using Table Selection or SQL Query methods, with real-time column mapping and validation.

The platform emphasizes performance optimization through clustering key selection, table partitioning strategies, and schema design best practices, ensuring efficient query execution against large-scale warehouse datasets while maintaining analytical flexibility and data governance requirements.
