Warehouse-native Amplitude (WNA) is a data analytics solution that enables organizations to perform behavioral analytics directly on their Snowflake data warehouse without data ingestion into Amplitude's platform. This approach maintains data sovereignty while providing access to Amplitude's analytical capabilities through secure, read-only connections.

## Core Architecture and Data Models

WNA operates on a hierarchical structure where warehouse connections enable project creation, projects contain multiple data models, and data models define analytical datasets. The platform supports six distinct data model types:

- **EVENT**: Fact tables containing behavioral event data with required unique_id, event_time, and event_type fields
- **EVENT_PROPERTIES**: Dimensional tables providing contextual data for specific events
- **CURRENT_USER_PROPERTIES**: Latest user attribute values with unique_id and property mappings
- **HISTORICAL_USER_PROPERTIES**: Time-series user attribute changes requiring start_time and end_time fields
- **CURRENT_GROUP_PROPERTIES**: Latest group/account attribute values
- **HISTORICAL_GROUP_PROPERTIES**: Time-series group attribute changes with temporal boundaries

The system accommodates flexible schema designs including star and snowflake configurations, supporting either single-event-per-table or multi-event table structures through specialized configuration options.

## Integration Methods and Configuration

WNA provides three primary configuration approaches:

**YAML Configuration**: Bulk model management using structured files with apiVersion `warehouse/models/v1`, enabling batch create and update operations across multiple model types. Configuration includes DataModel objects with FieldMapping specifications and either tableConfig or sqlConfig for data source definition.

**DBT Integration**: Leverages DBT manifest files with `amplitude_meta` annotations embedded in model definitions, supporting infrastructure-as-code workflows and version-controlled model deployment pipelines.

**Interactive Configuration**: Direct model creation through Amplitude's interface using Table Selection for direct table mapping or SQL Query options for custom data transformations with real-time validation.

## Technical Requirements and Optimization

All models require specific mandatory fields formatted as TIMESTAMP_NTZ for temporal analysis. The platform implements performance optimizations through clustering keys using the LINEAR() function for event_time columns, supporting table partitioning strategies for large-scale datasets.

Identity Spaces provide user identification frameworks for cross-model data correlation, while MTU (Monthly Tracked Users) counting methodology ensures accurate user analytics. Service account configurations maintain secure, read-only warehouse access with single connection per project limitations.

## Ecosystem Position and Limitations

WNA integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem while executing queries directly against customer Snowflake instances. The platform generates optimized SQL that returns results to Amplitude's visualization interfaces, supporting most standard analytics features with specific limitations on advanced formulas (HIST, PERCENTILE, ROLLWINBEFORE, CUMSUM, ACTIVE, ARPAU) and certain specialized chart types.

The warehouse-native approach enables organizations to leverage existing data infrastructure investments while accessing Amplitude's behavioral analytics capabilities, supporting modern data engineering practices through automated deployment pipelines and maintaining data governance requirements within customer-controlled environments.
