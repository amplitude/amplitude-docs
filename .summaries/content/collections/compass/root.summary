# Amplitude Compass: User Behavior Analysis and Retention Prediction Tool

## Product Overview

Amplitude Compass is an advanced analytics tool that helps product teams identify key user behaviors that predict retention and conversion. It analyzes correlations between user actions and desired outcomes, presenting results through intuitive heat map visualizations. Compass excels at discovering "a-ha moments" - specific user behaviors that significantly increase the likelihood of user retention or conversion.

Available to customers on Amplitude's Growth and Enterprise plans, Compass enables data-driven decisions about which user behaviors to encourage and optimize within products.

## Key Features and Capabilities

- **Correlation Analysis**: Identifies relationships between user behaviors and retention/conversion outcomes
- **Heat Map Visualization**: Displays correlation scores in an easy-to-interpret format
- **Threshold Testing**: Analyzes how different frequency thresholds of behaviors affect retention
- **Statistical Metrics**: Provides multiple measures to evaluate predictive power
- **Cohort Creation**: Enables creation of user segments based on identified behaviors

## Product Relationships and Architecture

Compass is integrated within the Amplitude analytics ecosystem:

1. **Data Source**: Leverages user event data collected through Amplitude's core analytics platform
2. **Workflow Integration**: Findings from Compass directly inform retention analysis workflows
3. **Cohort Utilization**: Cohorts created from Compass can be used throughout other Amplitude tools
4. **Insight Pipeline**: Serves as a bridge between raw user behavior data and actionable product insights

Compass helps teams identify which specific behaviors to encourage to improve overall retention metrics, functioning as a critical component in the product optimization workflow.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Core Concepts
- **Base Cohort**: Initial user group being analyzed (typically new users)
- **Target Cohort**: Outcome group (users who were retained or converted)
- **Range of First Use**: Time window for analyzing initial user behaviors
- **Performance Days Window**: Period during which target outcomes are measured
- **A-ha Moments**: Specific user behaviors strongly correlated with retention

### Statistical Metrics
- **Correlation Coefficient**: Primary measure (-1 to 1) of relationship strength
- **Proportion Above Threshold**: Percentage of users who performed an action at least X times
- **Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**: Likelihood users who perform an action will be retained
- **Sensitivity**: Percentage of retained users who performed the action
- **Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**: Likelihood users who don't perform an action won't be retained
- **Specificity**: Percentage of non-retained users who didn't perform the action

### Correlation Categories
- **Highly Predictive**: Correlation score ≥0.4
- **Moderately Predictive**: Correlation score 0.3-0.4
- **Slightly Predictive**: Correlation score 0.2-0.3
- **Not Predictive**: Correlation score <0.2

### Analysis Components
- **Heat Map**: Visual representation of correlation scores across events and thresholds
- **Statistical Significance**: Indicator showing reliability of correlation findings
- **Contingency Table**: Detailed breakdown of true/false positives and negatives
- **95% Confidence Interval**: Statistical measure of result reliability

## Implementation and Workflow

The typical Compass workflow involves:

1. Selecting a base cohort (e.g., new users)
2. Defining a target cohort (e.g., users retained for a second week)
3. Setting the range of first use and performance days window
4. Analyzing the resulting heat map to identify predictive behaviors
5. Creating cohorts based on identified behaviors for further analysis
6. Comparing retention metrics between users who did and didn't perform key actions

Compass is accessed through the Amplitude interface and does not appear to have specific API endpoints or command line invocations mentioned in the documentation.
