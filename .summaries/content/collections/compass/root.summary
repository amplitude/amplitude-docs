Amplitude Compass is an advanced behavioral analytics product that identifies user actions predictive of retention and conversion through sophisticated statistical correlation analysis. The platform helps product teams discover critical "a-ha moments" and inflection metrics by analyzing relationships between early user behaviors and long-term engagement outcomes.

## Core Product Architecture

**Compass Chart Engine**
The primary interface is the Compass chart, which performs correlation analysis between base cohorts (typically new users) and target cohorts (retained users at specific intervals). The system generates interactive heat map visualizations displaying correlation strengths across event frequency buckets and temporal windows, enabling teams to identify optimal user behavior patterns.

**Retention Cohort Integration**
Compass leverages pre-built Amplitude retention cohorts as analytical targets:
- [Amplitude] 2nd Week Retention
- [Amplitude] 3rd Week Retention  
- [Amplitude] 4th Month Retention

These standardized cohorts serve as outcome metrics for measuring behavioral predictive power within configurable performance windows.

**Statistical Analysis Framework**
The product employs multiple statistical methodologies including:
- Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and Negative Predictive Value (NPV)
- Sensitivity and specificity calculations
- Matthews Pearson phi coefficient correlation
- Contingency matrix analysis with comprehensive classification metrics
- 95% confidence interval significance testing

## Key Terminology and Definitions

**Base Cohort**: Initial user segment under analysis (e.g., New Users cohort)
**Target Cohort**: Desired outcome population (e.g., users demonstrating 2-week retention)
**Range of First Use**: Temporal boundary defining the analysis window for initial user behaviors
**Inflection Metrics**: Specific user actions demonstrating strong statistical correlation with retention/conversion outcomes
**Performance Days Window**: Time period measuring the relationship between user actions and target outcomes
**Event Frequency Buckets**: Segmentation methodology grouping user actions by occurrence frequency for correlation analysis
**Correlation Score Categorization**: Statistical thresholds classifying predictive strength as Highly/Moderately/Slightly/Not Predictive
**Contingency Matrix**: Statistical framework analyzing true positives, false negatives, true negatives, and false positives in behavioral prediction

## Product Ecosystem Position

Compass functions as a specialized predictive analytics layer within the Amplitude platform, exclusively available to Growth and Enterprise tier customers. The product bridges descriptive behavioral analytics with predictive modeling capabilities, enabling data-driven product optimization strategies.

**Workflow Integration**
The system supports seamless transitions from insight discovery to actionable implementation through direct cohort creation from analysis results. Teams can identify predictive behaviors, generate statistical confidence measures, and immediately create targeted user segments for engagement campaigns or A/B testing initiatives.

**Statistical Rigor**
Compass emphasizes statistical validity through correlation vs. causation analysis, Type I/Type II error considerations, and comprehensive confidence interval reporting. The platform generates detailed correlation tables with full statistical context, supporting evidence-based decision making for feature development, user onboarding optimization, and retention strategy refinement.

The product serves as a critical component in the modern product analytics stack, transforming raw user event data into actionable behavioral insights that directly inform product strategy and user experience improvements.
