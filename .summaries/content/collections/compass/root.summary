Amplitude Compass is an advanced behavioral analytics feature within Amplitude Analytics that uses sophisticated correlation analysis to identify critical user behaviors predictive of retention and conversion outcomes. Available exclusively on Growth and Enterprise plans, Compass serves as a discovery engine for "a-ha moments" and behavioral inflection points that distinguish users likely to become retained customers from those at risk of churning.

## Core Features and Functionality

**Correlation Analysis Engine**: Compass employs rigorous statistical methodology to analyze correlations between user events and retention outcomes. The system utilizes multiple statistical measures including Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Negative Predictive Value (NPV), sensitivity, and specificity. Statistical calculations are based on contingency matrices and binary random variables, computing Matthews correlation, Pearson correlation, and phi coefficients with 95% confidence intervals to ensure analytical reliability.

**A-ha Moment Discovery**: The platform identifies specific user behaviors that predict 2nd week retention by analyzing new user cohorts and their behavioral patterns. This capability helps product teams understand which early user actions serve as leading indicators of long-term engagement and customer value.

**Inflection Metrics Identification**: Compass determines critical behavioral thresholds and proportion-above-threshold metrics that function as predictive indicators of user growth and retention. These inflection points enable teams to focus optimization efforts on the most impactful user behaviors.

**Heat Map Visualization**: Analysis results are presented through interactive heat map interfaces that display event correlation analysis across different frequency buckets. This visualization approach makes it easy to identify patterns in user behavior correlation with retention outcomes and categorize findings into correlation score buckets.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

Compass integrates deeply with Amplitude's event tracking infrastructure and cohort management system. The feature operates by creating and analyzing base cohorts (initial user segments) and target cohorts (desired outcome groups) for behavioral pattern analysis. The correlation analysis functions within configurable performance days windows, examining user behavior patterns over specified timeframes to identify the most predictive events and behavioral thresholds.

Results from Compass analysis can be exported to create new cohorts for further analysis or targeting in other Amplitude features, creating a seamless workflow between discovery and activation. The platform supports analysis of broad event categories including "Any Event" and "Any Active Event" for comprehensive behavioral examination.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Base Cohort**: The initial user segment being analyzed for behavioral patterns and correlation analysis
**Target Cohort**: The desired outcome group (e.g., retained users) that the analysis aims to predict through behavioral indicators
**Correlation Score Buckets**: Categorized groupings of correlation strength including Highly Predictive, Moderately Predictive, Slightly Predictive, and Not Predictive classifications
**Contingency Table**: Statistical framework organizing analysis results into true positives, false positives, false negatives, and true negatives for correlation calculation
**Inflection Metrics**: Behavioral thresholds and frequency patterns that serve as critical predictors of user lifecycle outcomes
**Performance Days Window**: The configurable timeframe over which user behavior is analyzed for correlation patterns and predictive value
**A-ha Moments**: Specific user behaviors or behavioral combinations that demonstrate strong predictive correlation with retention and conversion outcomes

## Statistical Framework and Methodology

Compass employs rigorous statistical methodology with 95% confidence intervals to ensure reliability and significance of correlation findings. The system accounts for Type I and Type II errors in its analysis framework and maintains clear distinction between correlation and causation in reporting. Statistical significance indicators help teams make data-driven decisions based on robust analytical foundations, with clear confidence measures for all correlation discoveries.

## Ecosystem Integration and Positioning

Within Amplitude's broader product ecosystem, Compass functions as a sophisticated discovery and optimization tool that feeds behavioral insights into other platform capabilities. The cohorts and behavioral patterns identified through Compass analysis integrate with Amplitude's experimentation, personalization, and user journey optimization features, enabling comprehensive growth analytics workflows.

Compass represents Amplitude's advanced analytics tier, positioned for organizations requiring sophisticated behavioral prediction and user lifecycle optimization capabilities beyond basic event tracking and funnel analysis. The feature bridges the gap between raw behavioral data and actionable growth insights, enabling product teams to identify and optimize the specific user behaviors that drive business outcomes.

The platform's correlation analysis capabilities support both broad behavioral discovery and targeted optimization efforts, making it suitable for organizations at various stages of product maturity seeking to understand and improve user retention and conversion patterns through data-driven behavioral insights.
