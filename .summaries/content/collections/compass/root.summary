# Amplitude Compass: User Behavior Analysis for Retention Prediction

## Product Overview

Amplitude Compass is an advanced analytics tool that helps product teams identify which user behaviors are most predictive of retention and conversion. It analyzes correlations between early user actions and long-term engagement, presenting these insights through heat map visualizations. Compass enables teams to discover their product's "a-ha moments" - the key experiences that significantly influence whether users become retained, active customers.

The tool works by analyzing patterns in user behavior data to determine which actions, and at what frequency, best predict retention into subsequent time periods. This allows product teams to focus their development efforts, onboarding experiences, and engagement strategies on the behaviors that matter most for long-term success.

## Product Relationships and Features

Compass operates by analyzing two distinct user cohorts:

1. **Base Cohort**: The initial user group being analyzed (typically new users)
2. **Target Cohort**: The outcome group (typically retained or converted users)

The core output is the Compass chart, which displays:
- A heat map visualization showing correlation scores between specific user events and retention outcomes
- Frequency buckets that segment users by how often they performed specific actions
- Color-coded correlation scores categorized by predictive strength
- Statistical significance indicators with 95% confidence intervals

Compass integrates with Amplitude's cohort creation functionality, allowing users to immediately create and analyze segments based on the behaviors identified as most predictive of retention. This creates a seamless workflow from insight discovery to actionable segmentation.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **A-ha moments**: Key user experiences that significantly correlate with long-term retention
- **Correlation scores**: Values ranging from -1 to 1 that measure the relationship between user events and retention
- **Predictive categorization**:
  - Highly Predictive: ≥0.4
  - Moderately Predictive: 0.3-0.4
  - Slightly Predictive: 0.2-0.3
  - Not Predictive: <0.2
- **Inflection metrics**: Behavioral thresholds that predict user retention or conversion
- **Range of first use**: The time period during which user behaviors are analyzed
- **Performance days window**: The timeframe used to evaluate user outcomes
- **Statistical metrics**:
  - **Proportion above threshold**: Percentage of users who meet a specific behavioral threshold
  - **Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**: Probability that users who perform an action will be retained
  - **Sensitivity**: Percentage of retained users who performed the action
  - **Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**: Probability that users who don't perform an action won't be retained
  - **Specificity**: Percentage of non-retained users who didn't perform the action
- **Contingency tables**: 2x2 tables showing the relationship between performing an action and retention outcomes

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Compass is an integral component of Amplitude's analytics suite, available to customers on Growth and Enterprise plans. It leverages and enhances other Amplitude capabilities:

1. It builds upon Amplitude's core event tracking infrastructure to analyze behavioral patterns
2. It connects with Amplitude's cohort functionality to enable immediate segmentation based on insights
3. It complements other Amplitude analytics tools by providing specific insights into retention drivers
4. It informs product development and user onboarding strategies with data-driven behavioral insights

The typical workflow involves:
1. Using Compass to identify key predictive behaviors and their frequency thresholds
2. Creating cohorts based on these behaviors for further analysis
3. Analyzing these cohorts to understand retention differences and opportunities
4. Implementing product changes based on the identified "a-ha moments"
5. Monitoring changes in retention metrics after implementing these insights

## Usage and Interface

Compass is accessed through Amplitude's user interface. The workflow includes:

1. Selecting base and target cohorts for analysis
2. Viewing the resulting heat map visualization
3. Filtering and sorting results by correlation strength
4. Creating cohorts directly from the Compass chart results
5. Viewing detailed statistical metrics including PPV, NPV, sensitivity, and specificity
6. Toggling between different statistical views including correlation scores and positive predictive values

The tool helps product teams answer critical questions such as:
- "What behaviors in the first week predict retention into the second week?"
- "What is the minimum threshold of a specific action that predicts user retention?"
- "Which features should we prioritize in our onboarding experience?"
- "How do we identify users at risk of churning based on early behavioral signals?"

By identifying these key behavioral patterns, Compass enables product teams to make data-driven decisions about feature development, user onboarding, and engagement strategies.
