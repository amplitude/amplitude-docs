# Amplitude Compass: User Behavior Analysis and Retention Prediction Tool

## Product Overview

Amplitude Compass is an advanced analytics tool that helps product teams identify key user behaviors that predict retention and conversion. It analyzes correlations between user actions and desired outcomes, presenting results through interactive heat map visualizations. Compass excels at discovering "a-ha moments" - specific user behaviors that significantly increase the likelihood of user retention or conversion.

Available to customers on Amplitude's Growth and Enterprise plans, Compass focuses on helping teams understand which early user behaviors are most predictive of long-term success with their product.

## Product Relationships and Features

Compass functions as a discovery tool within Amplitude's analytics ecosystem, with several interconnected components:

1. **Correlation Analysis Engine**: The core analytical system that calculates statistical relationships between user behaviors and outcomes
2. **Visualization Layer**: Presents analysis results through heat maps and contingency tables
3. **Cohort Creation Tool**: Enables segmentation of users based on identified behaviors
4. **Integration Framework**: Connects findings with other Amplitude tools for further analysis

The product follows a structured workflow where users:
- Define base and target cohorts
- Set analysis timeframes
- Interpret correlation results
- Create and validate behavior-based segments
- Implement product improvements based on insights

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Analysis Framework Terms
- **Base Cohort**: Initial user group being analyzed (typically new users)
- **Target Cohort**: Outcome group (users who were retained or converted)
- **Range of First Use**: Time period during which user behaviors are analyzed
- **Performance Days Window**: Timeframe for measuring the target outcome

### Statistical Measures
- **Correlation Score**: Ranges from -1 to 1, measuring relationship strength between behaviors and outcomes
- **Proportion Above Threshold**: Percentage of users who performed an action at least X times
- **Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**: Likelihood that users who performed an action achieved the desired outcome
- **Sensitivity**: Percentage of users who achieved the outcome who also performed the action
- **Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**: Likelihood that users who didn't perform an action didn't achieve the outcome
- **Specificity**: Percentage of users who didn't achieve the outcome who also didn't perform the action

### Correlation Categories
- **Highly Predictive**: ≥0.4 correlation score
- **Moderately Predictive**: 0.3-0.4 correlation score
- **Slightly Predictive**: 0.2-0.3 correlation score
- **Not Predictive**: <0.2 correlation score

### Key Concepts
- **Inflection Metrics**: User behaviors that, when performed at a certain frequency, significantly increase retention likelihood
- **A-ha Moments**: Key user experiences that dramatically increase the likelihood of long-term engagement
- **Contingency Matrix/Table**: A 2×2 table showing the relationship between performing an action and achieving an outcome
- **Statistical Significance**: Indicated by a 95% confidence interval that doesn't include zero

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Compass is integrated within Amplitude's broader analytics platform, enabling a comprehensive workflow:

1. **Discovery**: Use Compass to identify key predictive behaviors and potential "a-ha moments"
2. **Segmentation**: Create cohorts based on Compass findings for targeted analysis
3. **Validation**: Compare retention rates between cohorts using other Amplitude tools
4. **Implementation**: Apply insights to product development, user onboarding, and engagement strategies

Compass findings can inform product decisions across multiple teams:
- Product managers can prioritize features that drive key behaviors
- UX designers can optimize flows around critical actions
- Marketing teams can highlight key features in onboarding
- Customer success can guide users toward behaviors that increase retention

The tool serves as a bridge between raw analytics data and actionable product insights, helping teams understand not just what users do, but which behaviors actually matter for long-term success.

Compass appears to be accessed through Amplitude's web interface rather than through standalone API endpoints or command line tools, functioning as an integrated analytics feature within the broader Amplitude platform.
