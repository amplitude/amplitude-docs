# Amplitude Compass: User Behavior Analysis for Retention Prediction

## Product Overview

Amplitude Compass is an advanced analytics tool that helps product teams identify which user behaviors most strongly predict retention and conversion. Using correlation analysis, Compass examines the relationship between new user actions and their likelihood to become active, retained users. Results are presented in an intuitive heat map visualization that highlights key "a-ha moments" - specific actions that significantly increase the probability of user retention.

Compass enables teams to move beyond intuition by applying statistical analysis to user behavior data, providing data-driven insights for optimizing onboarding and engagement strategies. The product is available exclusively to customers on Amplitude's Growth and Enterprise plans.

## Product Relationships and Features

Compass functions as part of Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem with these key features:

1. **Correlation Analysis Engine**: Analyzes relationships between user behaviors and retention outcomes
2. **Heat Map Visualization**: Displays correlation scores between events and retention across time periods
3. **Inflection Metric Identification**: Discovers threshold values for behaviors that predict retention
4. **Cohort Creation Tools**: Enables creation of user segments based on identified behaviors
5. **Statistical Significance Testing**: Provides confidence intervals and significance measures

Compass works by analyzing two key cohorts:
- **Base Cohort**: The initial group of users being analyzed (typically new users)
- **Target Cohort**: The subset of base cohort users who achieved the desired outcome (retention or conversion)

The tool examines user behaviors during a configurable "Performance Days Window" to identify which actions correlate most strongly with retention outcomes.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **A-ha Moments**: Key user behaviors that significantly increase likelihood of retention
- **Correlation Scores**: Range from -1 to 1, with categorizations:
  - Highly Predictive (≥0.4)
  - Moderately Predictive (0.3-0.4)
  - Slightly Predictive (0.2-0.3)
  - Not Predictive (<0.2)
- **Inflection Metrics**: Specific behaviors and threshold values that best predict retention
- **Contingency Matrix/Table**: A 2x2 table showing relationship between performing an event and retention
- **Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**: Probability that users who performed an event will be retained
- **Sensitivity**: Percentage of retained users who performed the event
- **Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**: Probability that users who didn't perform an event won't be retained
- **Specificity**: Percentage of non-retained users who didn't perform the event
- **Proportion Above Threshold**: Percentage of users who performed an event at or above a certain frequency
- **Event Frequency Buckets**: Groupings of users based on how often they performed a specific event
- **Second-Week Retention**: A common target metric measuring if users return in their second week

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Compass integrates with the broader Amplitude platform in several ways:

1. **Data Source**: Leverages event data collected through Amplitude's core analytics platform
2. **Cohort Export**: Cohorts created from Compass findings can be used throughout Amplitude
3. **Retention Analysis**: Directly supports retention optimization efforts by identifying predictive behaviors
4. **Experiment Integration**: Insights can inform A/B testing hypotheses in Amplitude Experiment
5. **Behavioral Analytics Extension**: Extends Amplitude's behavioral analytics with predictive modeling

Compass serves as a specialized analytical tool within Amplitude's product suite, focusing specifically on identifying behavioral predictors of retention and conversion. It complements other Amplitude tools by providing statistically rigorous insights into which user actions most strongly correlate with desired outcomes.

## Usage Workflow

The typical Compass workflow involves:

1. Selecting a base cohort (typically new users) and target cohort (retained users)
2. Choosing the retention period to analyze (e.g., second-week retention)
3. Reviewing the heat map to identify highly correlated events and time periods
4. Examining statistical significance and alternative metrics for promising correlations
5. Creating cohorts based on identified behaviors to compare retention metrics
6. Using insights to optimize onboarding and engagement strategies

This structured approach helps product teams identify and prioritize the most impactful user behaviors for improving retention.
