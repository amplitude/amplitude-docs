Amplitude Compass is an advanced predictive analytics feature that identifies user behaviors correlating with retention and conversion outcomes through sophisticated statistical analysis. The product enables organizations to discover critical "a-ha moments" and inflection metrics by analyzing relationships between user actions and long-term engagement patterns.

## Core Features and Product Architecture

**Compass Chart Engine**
The primary component is the Compass chart, which performs correlation analysis between base cohorts (typically new users) and target cohorts (retained users at specific intervals). The system generates interactive heat map visualizations displaying correlation strengths across event frequency buckets and configurable time windows.

**Pre-built Retention Cohort Integration**
Compass leverages Amplitude's standardized retention cohorts as target metrics:
- [Amplitude] 2nd Week Retention
- [Amplitude] 3rd Week Retention  
- [Amplitude] 4th Month Retention

These cohorts serve as outcome variables for measuring predictive power of user behaviors within customizable "range of first use" and "performance days window" parameters.

**Statistical Analysis Framework**
The product employs multiple statistical measures including correlation scores, Positive Predictive Value (PPV), sensitivity, Negative Predictive Value (NPV), and specificity. Analysis utilizes contingency matrices calculating true positive/negative ratios and Type I/Type II error rates with 95% confidence intervals for statistical significance validation.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Base Cohort**: Initial user segment under analysis (e.g., New Users)
**Target Cohort**: Desired outcome group representing successful retention/conversion
**Correlation Score Classification**:
- Highly Predictive: ≥ 0.4
- Moderately Predictive: 0.3-0.4  
- Slightly Predictive: Below 0.3
- Not Predictive: Near-zero correlation

**Inflection Metrics**: User behaviors demonstrating strong predictive correlation with retention outcomes
**A-ha Moments**: Critical user experiences significantly increasing long-term engagement likelihood
**Contingency Matrix**: Statistical framework analyzing true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives
**Event Frequency Buckets**: Segmented ranges of user action frequency for granular correlation analysis
**Range of First Use**: Time window for capturing initial user behaviors
**Performance Days Window**: Period for measuring target outcome achievement

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Compass operates as a specialized analytics module within Amplitude's platform architecture, available exclusively on Growth and Enterprise subscription tiers. The product leverages Amplitude's core event tracking infrastructure, cohort management system, and user segmentation capabilities to deliver predictive insights.

**Statistical Methodologies**
The system implements Matthews correlation and Pearson correlation analysis with binary random variables correlation techniques. All statistical outputs include confidence intervals ensuring reliable business decision-making support.

**Visualization and Operationalization**
Heat map visualizations provide intuitive interpretation of complex correlation data, displaying relationships between event frequency and retention outcomes across time dimensions. Organizations can generate actionable user segments directly from Compass results, enabling targeted cohort creation based on identified predictive behaviors for campaign optimization and product development initiatives.

The product integrates seamlessly with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem, allowing correlation insights to inform segmentation strategies, A/B testing frameworks, and user journey optimization across the platform's analytical capabilities.
