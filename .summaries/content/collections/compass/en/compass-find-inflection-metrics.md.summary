# Summary
Compass is a feature that identifies inflection metrics - behaviors that predict retention or conversion by analyzing the correlation between event frequencies and user outcomes, using metrics like proportion above threshold, PPV, sensitivity, NPV, and specificity to find the optimal thresholds that maximize true positives and true negatives.
