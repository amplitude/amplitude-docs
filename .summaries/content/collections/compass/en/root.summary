## Amplitude Compass Product Overview

Amplitude Compass is an advanced analytics feature within Amplitude Analytics that identifies critical user behaviors predictive of retention and conversion outcomes. Available exclusively on Growth and Enterprise plans, Compass uses sophisticated correlation analysis to discover "a-ha moments" and inflection metrics that indicate when users are likely to become active, retained customers versus when they may churn.

## Core Features and Functionality

**Correlation Analysis Engine**: Compass analyzes correlations between user events and retention outcomes using statistical measures including Positive Predictive Value (PPV), Negative Predictive Value (NPV), sensitivity, and specificity. The system employs contingency matrices and binary random variables to calculate Matthews correlation, Pearson correlation, and phi coefficients.

**A-ha Moment Discovery**: The platform identifies specific user behaviors that predict 2nd week retention by analyzing new user cohorts and their behavioral patterns. This helps product teams understand which early actions lead to long-term user engagement.

**Inflection Metrics Identification**: Compass determines critical behavioral thresholds and proportion-above-threshold metrics that serve as leading indicators of user growth and retention, enabling teams to focus on the most impactful user actions.

**Heat Map Visualization**: Results are presented through interactive heat map views that display event correlation analysis across different frequency buckets, making it easy to identify patterns in user behavior correlation with retention outcomes.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

Compass integrates deeply with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem, leveraging the platform's event tracking infrastructure and cohort management capabilities. The feature creates base cohorts and target cohorts for analysis, allowing users to segment and analyze specific user populations. Results from Compass analysis can be exported to create new cohorts for further analysis or targeting in other Amplitude features.

The correlation analysis operates within configurable performance days windows, analyzing user behavior patterns over specified timeframes to identify the most predictive events and thresholds.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Base Cohort**: The initial user segment being analyzed for behavioral patterns
**Target Cohort**: The desired outcome group (e.g., retained users) that the analysis aims to predict
**Correlation Score Buckets**: Categorized groupings of correlation strength (Highly Predictive, Moderately Predictive, Slightly Predictive, Not Predictive)
**Contingency Table**: Statistical framework organizing true positives, false positives, false negatives, and true negatives
**Inflection Metrics**: Behavioral thresholds that serve as critical predictors of user outcomes
**Performance Days Window**: The timeframe over which user behavior is analyzed for correlation patterns
**Any Event/Any Active Event**: Broad event categories used for comprehensive behavioral analysis

## Statistical Framework

Compass employs rigorous statistical methodology with 95% confidence intervals to ensure reliability of correlation findings. The system accounts for Type I and Type II errors in its analysis and distinguishes between correlation and causation in its reporting. Statistical significance is clearly indicated, helping teams make data-driven decisions based on robust analytical foundations.

## Ecosystem Integration

Within the broader Amplitude product ecosystem, Compass serves as a discovery and optimization tool that feeds insights into other platform capabilities. The cohorts and behavioral insights generated through Compass analysis can be leveraged across Amplitude's experimentation, personalization, and user journey optimization features, creating a comprehensive growth analytics workflow.

The feature represents Amplitude's advanced analytics tier, positioned for organizations requiring sophisticated behavioral prediction and user lifecycle optimization capabilities beyond basic event tracking and funnel analysis.
