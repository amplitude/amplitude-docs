## Amplitude Compass Product Overview

Amplitude Compass is an advanced analytics feature designed to identify user behaviors that predict retention and conversion through sophisticated correlation analysis. The product helps organizations discover "a-ha moments" and inflection metrics by analyzing statistical relationships between user actions and long-term engagement outcomes.

## Core Features and Product Relationships

**Compass Chart Functionality**
The central component is the Compass chart, which performs correlation analysis between base cohorts (typically new users) and target cohorts (retained users at specific time intervals). The chart generates heat map visualizations that display correlation strengths across different event frequencies and time windows.

**Retention Analysis Integration**
Compass integrates with Amplitude's pre-built retention cohorts including:
- [Amplitude] 2nd Week Retention
- [Amplitude] 3rd Week Retention  
- [Amplitude] 4th Month Retention

These cohorts serve as target metrics for measuring the predictive power of user behaviors within specified performance windows.

**Statistical Analysis Engine**
The product employs multiple statistical measures including:
- Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and Negative Predictive Value (NPV)
- Sensitivity and specificity metrics
- Matthews Pearson phi coefficient correlation
- Contingency matrix analysis with true positive/negative ratios

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Base Cohort**: The initial user segment being analyzed (e.g., New Users)
**Target Cohort**: The desired outcome group (e.g., users retained after 2 weeks)
**Range of First Use**: Time window for analyzing initial user behaviors
**Inflection Metrics**: Specific user actions that serve as strong predictors of retention/conversion
**Correlation Score Categorization**: Thresholds that classify predictive strength as Highly/Moderately/Slightly/Not Predictive
**Contingency Matrix**: Statistical framework analyzing true positives, false negatives, and other classification outcomes
**Event Frequency Buckets**: Segmentation of user actions by occurrence frequency for correlation analysis
**Performance Days Window**: Time period for measuring the relationship between actions and outcomes

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Compass operates as a specialized analytics layer within the broader Amplitude platform, specifically designed for Growth and Enterprise plan customers. It connects user event data with retention analytics to provide actionable insights for product optimization and user engagement strategies.

The product bridges behavioral analytics with predictive modeling, enabling product teams to identify which specific user actions correlate with long-term retention. This integration supports data-driven decision making for feature development, onboarding optimization, and user experience improvements.

**Statistical Framework**
Compass employs rigorous statistical methodology including 95% confidence intervals for significance testing, correlation vs. causation analysis, and Type I/Type II error considerations. The system generates detailed correlation tables and supports cohort creation directly from analysis results, enabling seamless transition from insight discovery to targeted user segmentation and engagement campaigns.
