# Amplitude Compass: User Behavior Analysis for Retention Prediction

## Product Overview

Amplitude Compass is an advanced analytics tool designed to help product teams identify which user behaviors most strongly predict retention and conversion. Compass analyzes correlations between new user actions and their likelihood to become active, retained users, presenting results in an intuitive heat map visualization. The tool helps teams discover "a-ha moments" - key actions that significantly increase the probability of user retention - by examining both what users do and when they do it.

Compass is available to customers on Amplitude's Growth and Enterprise plans, providing data-driven insights to optimize user onboarding and engagement strategies. The tool allows teams to move beyond intuition and use statistical analysis to identify the most impactful user behaviors.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Core Functionality
- **Correlation Analysis**: Measures the relationship between user behaviors and retention/conversion outcomes
- **Heat Map Visualization**: Displays correlation scores between events and retention across different time periods
- **Inflection Metric Identification**: Discovers threshold values for behaviors that predict retention
- **Cohort Creation**: Enables creation of user segments based on identified behaviors for further analysis
- **Statistical Significance Testing**: Provides confidence intervals and significance measures for correlations

### Key Metrics
- **Correlation Scores**: Range from -1 to 1, categorized as:
  - Highly Predictive (≥0.4)
  - Moderately Predictive (0.3-0.4)
  - Slightly Predictive (0.2-0.3)
  - Not Predictive (<0.2)
- **Proportion Above Threshold**: Percentage of users who performed an event at or above a certain frequency
- **Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**: Probability that users who performed an event will be retained
- **Sensitivity**: Percentage of retained users who performed the event
- **Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**: Probability that users who didn't perform an event won't be retained
- **Specificity**: Percentage of non-retained users who didn't perform the event

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **A-ha Moments**: Key user behaviors that significantly increase the likelihood of retention
- **Base Cohort**: The initial group of users being analyzed (typically new users)
- **Target Cohort**: The subset of base cohort users who achieved the desired outcome (retention or conversion)
- **Inflection Metrics**: Specific user behaviors and their threshold values that best predict retention
- **Performance Days Window**: The time period during which user behaviors are analyzed
- **Contingency Matrix/Table**: A 2x2 table showing the relationship between performing an event and retention
- **True Positive Ratio**: The proportion of users who both performed an event and were retained
- **True Negative Ratio**: The proportion of users who neither performed an event nor were retained
- **Event Frequency Buckets**: Groupings of users based on how often they performed a specific event
- **Second-Week Retention**: A common target metric measuring if users return in their second week

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Compass integrates with the broader Amplitude analytics platform, complementing other Amplitude tools:

1. **Amplitude Analytics**: Compass leverages the event data collected through Amplitude's core analytics platform
2. **Cohort Analysis**: Cohorts created from Compass findings can be used throughout Amplitude for further analysis
3. **Retention Analysis**: Compass directly supports retention optimization efforts by identifying predictive behaviors
4. **Experiment**: Insights from Compass can inform A/B testing hypotheses in Amplitude Experiment
5. **Behavioral Analytics**: Compass extends Amplitude's behavioral analytics capabilities with predictive modeling

## Usage Workflow

1. Select a base cohort (typically new users) and target cohort (retained users)
2. Choose the retention period to analyze (e.g., second-week retention)
3. Review the heat map to identify highly correlated events and time periods
4. Examine statistical significance and alternative metrics for promising correlations
5. Create cohorts based on identified behaviors to compare retention metrics
6. Use insights to optimize onboarding and engagement strategies

Compass helps product teams move beyond intuition to data-driven decision making by identifying the specific user behaviors that most strongly predict long-term retention and success.
