# Amplitude Compass: Predictive User Behavior Analysis

Compass is a powerful analytics feature within Amplitude that helps product teams identify which user behaviors best predict retention and conversion. It uses correlation analysis to discover "a-ha moments" - key actions that new users take that significantly increase their likelihood of becoming active, retained users.

## Key Features and Capabilities

1. **Correlation Analysis**: Compass analyzes the relationship between user actions and retention outcomes, calculating correlation coefficients (ranging from -1 to 1) to identify predictive behaviors.

2. **Heat Map Visualization**: Results are displayed in an intuitive heat map that shows which events and when they occur (within a user's first days/weeks) best predict retention.

3. **Predictive Categorization**: Correlation scores are categorized as:
   - Highly Predictive (≥0.4)
   - Moderately Predictive (0.3-0.4)
   - Slightly Predictive (0.2-0.3)
   - Not Predictive (<0.2)

4. **Statistical Significance**: Provides 95% confidence intervals to ensure findings are statistically valid.

5. **Inflection Metrics**: Identifies optimal thresholds for behaviors that maximize predictive power.

6. **Cohort Creation**: Enables creation of cohorts based on discovered behaviors for further analysis and targeting.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

Compass is part of Amplitude's analytics suite, available to Growth and Enterprise plan customers. It integrates with other Amplitude features:

1. **Cohort Analysis**: Compass findings can be used to create and compare cohorts based on specific behaviors.

2. **Retention Analysis**: Works alongside retention charts to identify behaviors that drive long-term retention.

3. **User Behavior Analysis**: Complements Pathfinder and other behavioral analysis tools by identifying which behaviors matter most.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Base Cohort**: The initial group of users being analyzed (typically new users).

2. **Target Cohort**: The outcome group - users who exhibited the desired behavior (retention or conversion).

3. **Range of First Use**: The time period during which user behaviors are analyzed (typically first days/weeks).

4. **Correlation Coefficient**: Statistical measure (-1 to 1) of the relationship between user actions and retention.

5. **Contingency Table/Matrix**: Shows the relationship between predicted and actual outcomes with:
   - True Positives: Users who performed the action and were retained
   - False Positives: Users who performed the action but weren't retained
   - True Negatives: Users who didn't perform the action and weren't retained
   - False Negatives: Users who didn't perform the action but were retained

6. **Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**: Percentage of users who performed an action and were retained.

7. **Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**: Percentage of users who didn't perform an action and weren't retained.

8. **Sensitivity**: Proportion of retained users who performed the action.

9. **Specificity**: Proportion of non-retained users who didn't perform the action.

10. **Inflection Metrics**: Behaviors with optimal thresholds that maximize predictive power.

11. **Performance Days**: The time period used to measure the target behavior (retention/conversion).

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Compass fits into Amplitude's broader product analytics ecosystem by:

1. Providing actionable insights that inform product development priorities
2. Identifying key behaviors to encourage during user onboarding
3. Supporting growth initiatives by highlighting behaviors that drive retention
4. Enabling more targeted user segmentation based on predictive behaviors
5. Complementing other Amplitude tools like Pathfinder, Retention, and Segmentation

## Usage and Implementation

While specific API endpoints aren't detailed in the documentation, Compass appears to be accessed through the Amplitude web interface. Users can:

1. Select a base cohort (typically new users)
2. Define a target cohort (retained users)
3. Specify the range of first use and performance days
4. View the resulting heat map of correlations
5. Create cohorts based on findings
6. Export or share insights with team members

Compass helps product teams answer critical questions like "What behaviors predict user retention?" and "How many times must users perform an action to become retained?" - enabling data-driven product development and growth strategies.
