# Amplitude Compass: User Behavior Analysis for Retention Prediction

## Product Overview

Amplitude Compass is an analytics tool that helps product teams identify which user behaviors best predict retention and conversion. The core functionality revolves around analyzing correlations between new user actions and their likelihood to become active, retained users. Compass presents these insights through heat map visualizations that show which events, and when they occur, best predict retention into a second week or beyond.

Key features of Compass include:
- Correlation analysis between user behaviors and retention outcomes
- Heat map visualization of predictive behaviors
- Identification of "a-ha moments" that drive user retention
- Statistical metrics to evaluate potential inflection points
- Cohort creation based on identified behaviors for further analysis
- Contingency tables for comparing retention rates

Compass is primarily designed for product teams seeking to understand which early user behaviors lead to long-term retention, helping them focus product development and onboarding efforts on the most impactful user actions.

## Product Relationships and Features

Compass is part of Amplitude's analytics suite and appears to be available to customers on Growth/Enterprise plans. The tool works by analyzing two key cohorts:

1. **Base Cohort**: The initial user group being analyzed, typically new users
2. **Target Cohort**: The outcome group, typically users who were retained or converted

The primary output is the Compass chart, which displays:
- A heat map visualization showing correlation scores between user events and retention
- Frequency buckets that segment users by how often they performed specific actions
- Correlation scores categorized by predictive strength
- Statistical significance indicators with 95% confidence intervals

Compass integrates with Amplitude's cohort creation functionality, allowing users to create and analyze segments based on the behaviors identified as predictive of retention.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **A-ha moments**: Key user experiences that significantly correlate with long-term retention
- **Correlation scores**: Values ranging from -1 to 1 that measure the relationship between user events and retention
- **Predictive categorization**:
  - Highly Predictive: ≥0.4
  - Moderately Predictive: 0.3-0.4
  - Slightly Predictive: 0.2-0.3
  - Not Predictive: <0.2
- **Inflection metrics**: Behavioral thresholds that predict user retention or conversion
- **Range of first use**: The time period during which user behaviors are analyzed
- **Performance days window**: The timeframe used to evaluate user outcomes
- **Statistical metrics**:
  - **Proportion above threshold**: Percentage of users who meet a specific behavioral threshold
  - **Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**: Probability that users who perform an action will be retained
  - **Sensitivity**: Percentage of retained users who performed the action
  - **Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**: Probability that users who don't perform an action won't be retained
  - **Specificity**: Percentage of non-retained users who didn't perform the action
- **Contingency tables**: 2x2 tables showing the relationship between performing an action and retention outcomes

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Compass appears to be an analytical tool within Amplitude's broader product analytics ecosystem. It works alongside other Amplitude features:

1. It leverages Amplitude's event tracking capabilities to analyze user behaviors
2. It connects with Amplitude's cohort functionality to create user segments based on identified behaviors
3. It provides insights that can be used in conjunction with other Amplitude tools for further analysis

The workflow typically involves:
1. Using Compass to identify key predictive behaviors
2. Creating cohorts based on these behaviors
3. Analyzing these cohorts further to understand retention differences
4. Using these insights to inform product development and user onboarding strategies

## API and Usage

While specific API endpoints aren't explicitly mentioned in the documentation, the Compass chart functionality appears to be accessed through Amplitude's user interface. Users can:

1. Select base and target cohorts for analysis
2. View the resulting heat map visualization
3. Filter and sort results by correlation strength
4. Create cohorts directly from the Compass chart results
5. View detailed statistical metrics including PPV, NPV, sensitivity, and specificity
6. Toggle between different statistical views including correlation scores and positive predictive values

The tool is designed to help product teams answer questions like "What behaviors in the first week predict retention into the second week?" and "What is the minimum threshold of a specific action that predicts user retention?"
