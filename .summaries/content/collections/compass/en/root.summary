# Amplitude Compass: User Behavior Analysis and Retention Prediction Tool

## Product Overview

Amplitude Compass is an advanced analytics tool designed to help product teams identify key user behaviors that predict retention and conversion. The tool analyzes correlations between user actions and desired outcomes, presenting results in an intuitive heat map visualization. Compass is particularly valuable for discovering "a-ha moments" - specific user behaviors that significantly increase the likelihood of user retention or conversion.

Compass is available to customers on Amplitude's Growth and Enterprise plans, enabling teams to make data-driven decisions about which user behaviors to encourage and optimize within their products.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Core Functionality
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identifies relationships between user behaviors and retention/conversion outcomes
- **Heat Map Visualization**: Displays correlation scores in an easy-to-interpret format
- **Threshold Testing**: Analyzes how different frequency thresholds of behaviors affect retention
- **Statistical Metrics**: Provides multiple statistical measures to evaluate predictive power
- **Cohort Creation**: Enables creation of user segments based on identified behaviors

### Key Concepts
1. **Base Cohort**: The initial user group being analyzed (typically new users)
2. **Target Cohort**: The outcome group (users who were retained or converted)
3. **Range of First Use**: Time window for analyzing initial user behaviors
4. **Performance Days Window**: Period during which target outcomes are measured
5. **Correlation Scores**: Values ranging from -1 to 1 indicating relationship strength
6. **A-ha Moments**: Specific user behaviors strongly correlated with retention

### Statistical Metrics
- **Correlation Coefficient**: Primary measure (-1 to 1) of relationship strength
- **Proportion Above Threshold**: Percentage of users who performed an action at least X times
- **Positive Predictive Value (PPV)**: Likelihood users who perform an action will be retained
- **Sensitivity**: Percentage of retained users who performed the action
- **Negative Predictive Value (NPV)**: Likelihood users who don't perform an action won't be retained
- **Specificity**: Percentage of non-retained users who didn't perform the action

## Product Relationships and Ecosystem

Compass integrates with the broader Amplitude analytics platform, complementing other Amplitude tools:

1. **Relationship with Amplitude Analytics**: Compass leverages user event data collected through Amplitude's core analytics platform
2. **Cohort Integration**: Cohorts created from Compass findings can be used throughout Amplitude
3. **Retention Analysis**: Compass findings directly inform retention analysis workflows

Compass serves as a bridge between raw user behavior data and actionable product insights, helping teams identify which specific behaviors to encourage to improve overall retention metrics.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Correlation Categories
- **Highly Predictive**: Correlation score ≥0.4
- **Moderately Predictive**: Correlation score 0.3-0.4
- **Slightly Predictive**: Correlation score 0.2-0.3
- **Not Predictive**: Correlation score <0.2

### Statistical Terms
- **True Positive**: Users who performed an action and were retained
- **False Positive**: Users who performed an action but weren't retained
- **True Negative**: Users who didn't perform an action and weren't retained
- **False Negative**: Users who didn't perform an action but were retained
- **95% Confidence Interval**: Statistical measure of result reliability

### Visualization Elements
- **Heat Map**: Visual representation of correlation scores across events and thresholds
- **Statistical Significance**: Indicator showing reliability of correlation findings
- **Contingency Table**: Detailed breakdown of true/false positives and negatives

## Usage and Implementation

Compass is accessed through the Amplitude interface and does not appear to have specific API endpoints or command line invocations mentioned in the documentation. The workflow typically involves:

1. Selecting a base cohort (e.g., new users)
2. Defining a target cohort (e.g., users retained for a second week)
3. Setting the range of first use and performance days window
4. Analyzing the resulting heat map to identify predictive behaviors
5. Creating cohorts based on identified behaviors for further analysis
6. Comparing retention metrics between users who did and didn't perform key actions

The tool provides multiple statistical measures to help teams validate findings and prioritize which user behaviors to focus on in product development and user onboarding.
