## Amplitude Compass Product Overview

Amplitude Compass is an advanced analytics feature designed to identify user behaviors that predict retention and conversion through sophisticated correlation analysis. The product helps organizations discover "a-ha moments" and inflection metrics by analyzing statistical relationships between user actions and long-term engagement outcomes.

## Core Features and Product Relationships

**Compass Chart Functionality**
The central component is the Compass chart, which performs correlation analysis between base cohorts (typically new users) and target cohorts (retained users at specific time intervals). The chart generates heat map visualizations that display correlation strengths across different event frequencies and time windows.

**Retention Analysis Integration**
Compass integrates with Amplitude's pre-built retention cohorts including:
- [Amplitude] 2nd Week Retention
- [Amplitude] 3rd Week Retention  
- [Amplitude] 4th Month Retention

These cohorts serve as target metrics for measuring the predictive power of user behaviors within configurable "range of first use" and "performance days window" timeframes.

**Statistical Analysis Engine**
The product employs multiple statistical measures including correlation scores, Positive Predictive Value (PPV), sensitivity, Negative Predictive Value (NPV), and specificity. These metrics are calculated using contingency matrices that analyze true positive/negative ratios and Type I/Type II error rates.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Base Cohort**: The initial user segment being analyzed (e.g., New Users)
**Target Cohort**: The desired outcome group (e.g., users retained after 2 weeks)
**Correlation Score Thresholds**:
- Highly Predictive: ≥ 0.4
- Moderately Predictive: 0.3-0.4  
- Slightly Predictive: Below 0.3
- Not Predictive: Near zero correlation

**Inflection Metrics**: Specific user behaviors that demonstrate strong predictive correlation with retention outcomes
**A-ha Moments**: Critical user experiences that significantly increase the likelihood of long-term engagement
**Contingency Matrix**: Statistical framework analyzing true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives
**Event Frequency Buckets**: Segmented ranges of user action frequency used for correlation analysis

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Compass operates as a specialized analytics module within the Amplitude platform, available on Growth and Enterprise plans. It leverages Amplitude's core event tracking infrastructure and cohort management system to perform advanced predictive analytics.

The product integrates with Amplitude's broader cohort creation and segmentation capabilities, allowing users to generate actionable user segments directly from Compass correlation results. This enables organizations to operationalize insights by creating targeted cohorts based on identified predictive behaviors.

**Statistical Framework**
Compass employs Matthews correlation and Pearson correlation methodologies with binary random variables correlation analysis. All results include 95% confidence intervals for statistical significance validation, ensuring reliable insights for business decision-making.

The heat map visualization system provides intuitive interpretation of complex correlation data, displaying relationships between event frequency and retention outcomes across configurable time windows. This allows product teams to identify optimal user engagement thresholds and timing for maximum retention impact.
