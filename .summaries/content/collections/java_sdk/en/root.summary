# Amplitude Java SDK Product Overview

The Amplitude Java SDK is a comprehensive analytics tracking solution for Java applications, providing developers with tools to track user behavior, events, and properties in their JRE-based applications. The SDK supports both direct implementation and a strongly-typed wrapper approach through the Ampli wrapper.

## Key Features and Concepts

- **Event Tracking**: Core functionality to track user actions and application events
- **Batch Mode**: Ability to collect multiple events and send them in batches
- **User Identification**: Methods to identify and track individual users
- **Group Analytics**: Support for organizing users into groups and tracking group-level events
- **Custom Properties**: Ability to attach custom properties to events and users
- **Middleware Support**: Extensibility through middleware for custom event processing
- **HTTP Proxy Support**: Configuration options for environments requiring proxy servers
- **Strongly-Typed Events**: Through the Ampli wrapper, enabling type-safe event tracking

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Amplitude Java SDK ecosystem consists of two main components:

1. **Core Java SDK**: The foundational library that provides direct access to Amplitude's analytics capabilities
2. **Ampli Wrapper**: A strongly-typed layer built on top of the core SDK that enforces tracking plan compliance

The Ampli wrapper is generated from a tracking plan defined in Amplitude's Data platform and provides type safety and validation for events, while the core SDK handles the actual event transmission and processing.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **AmplitudeClient**: The main client interface for interacting with Amplitude's analytics services
- **Event**: A user action or application occurrence that is tracked and sent to Amplitude
- **User Properties**: Attributes associated with a specific user (demographics, preferences, etc.)
- **Event Properties**: Attributes associated with a specific event occurrence
- **Tracking Plan**: A schema that defines the expected events and properties in an application
- **Middleware**: Custom code that can intercept, modify, or enhance events before they're sent
- **AmplitudeCallbacks**: Interface for handling success and error responses from the API
- **LoadOptions**: Configuration options when initializing the Ampli wrapper
- **EventOptions**: Additional options when tracking events through Ampli
- **MiddlewareExtra**: Custom context data passed to middleware functions

## Integration in Product Ecosystem

The Java SDK integrates with the broader Amplitude analytics platform, allowing data collected through the SDK to be analyzed in Amplitude's dashboards and tools. The Ampli wrapper specifically connects with Amplitude's Data platform through the Ampli CLI, enabling developers to:

1. Pull tracking plans defined in Amplitude (`ampli pull`)
2. Check the status of their implementation against the tracking plan (`ampli status`)
3. Ensure consistent event tracking across multiple platforms

## API and Implementation Details

### Core SDK Implementation

```java
// Initialize the SDK
Amplitude amplitude = Amplitude.getInstance();
amplitude.init("API_KEY");

// Track an event
amplitude.logEvent("EVENT_TYPE");

// Set user properties
Identify identify = new Identify().set("user_property", "value");
amplitude.identify(identify);

// Track events with properties
JSONObject eventProperties = new JSONObject().put("property_key", "property_value");
amplitude.logEvent("EVENT_TYPE", eventProperties);

// Set group
amplitude.setGroup("GROUP_TYPE", "GROUP_NAME");
```

### Ampli Wrapper Implementation

```java
// Initialize Ampli wrapper
ampli.load(LoadOptions.builder()
    .client(AmplitudeClient.builder()
        .apiKey("API_KEY")
        .build())
    .build());

// Identify a user
ampli.identify("user_id", 
    Identify.builder()
        .userProp("value")
        .build());

// Track a strongly-typed event
ampli.songPlayed(SongPlayed.builder()
    .songId("song-123")
    .build());

// Flush events
ampli.flush();
```

The SDK also supports configuration options for:
- Event batching and flushing intervals
- Thread timeouts
- Custom loggers
- HTTP proxy settings
- Callback handlers for success/error responses
