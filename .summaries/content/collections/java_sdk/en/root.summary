# Amplitude Java SDK Product Overview

The Amplitude Java SDK is a comprehensive analytics tracking solution for Java applications running on the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). It enables developers to track user behavior, application events, and analytics data from server-side Java applications.

## Key Features and Concepts

- **Event Tracking**: Capture user actions and application events with detailed properties
- **User Identification**: Associate events with specific users and their properties
- **Group Analytics**: Track and analyze user behavior within organizational groups
- **Batching Capabilities**: Optimize network usage with configurable event batching
- **Middleware Support**: Customize event processing with middleware functions
- **Type Safety**: Available through the Ampli wrapper for compile-time validation
- **High Performance**: Designed for efficient event tracking in production environments

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Java SDK ecosystem consists of two main components:

1. **Core JRE Java SDK**: The foundation library that provides all core functionality for tracking events in Java applications.

2. **Ampli for Java SDK**: A strongly-typed wrapper built on top of the core SDK that provides type safety based on a tracking plan.

The relationship between these components is hierarchical:
- The core SDK handles the fundamental event tracking, batching, and transmission logic
- The Ampli wrapper adds type safety and tracking plan validation on top of the core SDK
- Both components ultimately send data to the Amplitude Analytics platform

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: A discrete user action or application occurrence that is tracked
- **Event Properties**: Additional data attributes attached to events
- **User Properties**: Attributes associated with a specific user
- **Identify**: The process of associating events with a specific user identity
- **Group**: A collection of users that can be analyzed together
- **Tracking Plan**: A schema that defines expected events and their properties
- **Middleware**: Custom functions that can process events before they're sent
- **Batch Mode**: A configuration that groups events before sending them to Amplitude
- **Flush**: The action of immediately sending all queued events to Amplitude

## API and Usage Patterns

### Core JRE Java SDK

```java
// Installation
implementation 'com.amplitude:analytics-java:1.10.0'

// Initialization
Amplitude amplitude = Amplitude.getInstance();
amplitude.init("API_KEY");

// Configuration
amplitude.setUseBatchMode(true);
amplitude.setEventUploadThreshold(50);
amplitude.setEventUploadPeriodMillis(10000);

// Tracking Events
amplitude.logEvent(new Event("EVENT_TYPE", "USER_ID"));

// User Properties
Identify identify = new Identify()
    .set("email", "user@example.com")
    .setOnce("initial_signup_date", "2020-01-01");
amplitude.identify("USER_ID", identify);

// Group Analytics
amplitude.setGroup("GROUP_TYPE", "GROUP_NAME", "USER_ID");

// Flushing Events
amplitude.flushEvents();
```

### Ampli for Java SDK

```java
// Installation
implementation 'com.amplitude:analytics-java:1.10.0'
implementation 'com.amplitude:ampli-java:1.0.0'

// Initialization from tracking plan
Ampli ampli = new Ampli();
ampli.load(new LoadOptions().setEnvironment(Environment.PRODUCTION));

// Tracking typed events
ampli.songPlayed("user_id")
    .setArtistName("Artist Name")
    .setSongLength(120)
    .track();

// User identification with type safety
ampli.identify("user_id", new Identify()
    .set("plan", "premium")
    .set("role", "admin"));
```

### Ampli CLI Commands

```bash
# Pull tracking plan
ampli pull

# Check implementation status
ampli status
```

## Integration in Product Ecosystem

The Java SDK is part of Amplitude's broader analytics platform, designed specifically for server-side Java applications. It complements other Amplitude SDKs for client-side platforms (web, mobile) by providing:

1. Server-side event tracking capabilities
2. Backend service analytics
3. Cross-platform user tracking when used alongside client SDKs

The SDK integrates with the main Amplitude Analytics platform, allowing data collected through the Java SDK to be analyzed alongside data from other sources in Amplitude's dashboards, reports, and analysis tools.

The Ampli wrapper further enhances this integration by ensuring that tracked events conform to a centralized tracking plan, maintaining consistency across different platforms and applications within an organization's analytics implementation.

# Human: I need to understand how to use the Java SDK to track events. Can you provide a step-by-step guide on how to set up the SDK, initialize it, and track a simple event?
