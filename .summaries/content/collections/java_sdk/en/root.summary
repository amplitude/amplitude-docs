## Amplitude Java SDK Product Suite

The Amplitude Java SDK is a comprehensive analytics tracking solution for Java applications (Java 6+) that enables developers to instrument event tracking and user analytics. The SDK consists of two primary components: the core Java SDK for JRE programs and Ampli, a code generation wrapper that provides strongly-typed event tracking.

## Product Architecture and Component Relationships

### Core Java SDK (JRE)
The foundational `com.amplitude:java-sdk` provides the base analytics functionality with flexible event tracking capabilities. It supports both individual event logging and batch mode operations, utilizing Amplitude's HTTP V2 API for data transmission. The SDK handles user identification, session tracking, device information collection, and group-based analytics.

### Ampli Wrapper
Ampli serves as an enhanced layer built on top of the core Java SDK, generating strongly-typed event tracking code from Amplitude Data tracking plans. This wrapper eliminates runtime errors by providing compile-time validation of event schemas and properties, ensuring data consistency across development teams.

The relationship between these components follows a layered architecture:
- **Ampli** (Type-safe wrapper layer)
- **Core Java SDK** (Base analytics engine)
- **Amplitude HTTP V2 API** (Backend service)

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Core SDK Terminology
- **Event Logging**: Primary method for tracking user actions via `logEvent()` method
- **Batch Mode**: Efficient data transmission by grouping multiple events using `useBatchMode()`
- **Event Upload Threshold**: Configurable limit triggering automatic event transmission via `setEventUploadThreshold()`
- **Flush Operations**: Manual or automatic sending of queued events with configurable timeout periods
- **Group Functionality**: Organizational event tracking using `groupType` and `groupName` parameters
- **Middleware**: Extensible processing pipeline using `MiddlewarePayload` and `MiddlewareNext` interfaces

### Ampli-Specific Terminology
- **Tracking Plan**: Schema definition source for code generation in Amplitude Data
- **LoadOptions/LoadClientOptions**: Configuration objects for Ampli initialization
- **Strongly-typed Events**: Generated event classes (e.g., `SongPlayed`) with predefined properties
- **Identify Builder**: Type-safe user property assignment interface
- **EventOptions**: Event-level configuration including `MiddlewareExtra` data
- **Ampli CLI**: Command-line tool for code generation and implementation verification

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The Java SDK integrates into Amplitude's comprehensive analytics platform ecosystem. It connects with:

### Amplitude Data Platform
- **Tracking Plans**: Central schema management for consistent event definitions
- **Data Validation**: Server-side verification of event structure and properties
- **Cross-platform Consistency**: Unified event schemas across mobile, web, and server implementations

### Development Workflow Integration
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Ampli CLI enables automated code generation and validation
- **Multi-language Support**: Consistent API patterns across Amplitude's SDK family
- **Enterprise Features**: HTTP proxy support, custom server endpoints, and batch processing for high-volume applications

## API Endpoints and Command Line Interface

### Core SDK Configuration Methods
- `setServerUrl()`: Custom endpoint configuration
- `setEventUploadThreshold()`: Batch size management
- `setEventUploadPeriodMillis()`: Automatic flush timing
- `logEvent()`: Primary event tracking method
- `setGroup()`: Group-level event association

### Ampli CLI Commands
- `ampli pull`: Downloads generated wrapper code from tracking plans
- `ampli status`: Validates implementation completeness against tracking plan requirements

### Event Types
- **$identify**: User property updates
- **$groupidentify**: Group property modifications
- **Custom Events**: Application-specific tracking with flexible property schemas

The SDK supports both Gradle dependency management and direct JAR file integration, accommodating various Java development environments while maintaining consistent functionality across deployment scenarios.
