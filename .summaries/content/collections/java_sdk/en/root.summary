# Amplitude Java SDK Product Overview

## Product Overview

The Amplitude Java SDK is a comprehensive analytics tracking solution for Java applications running on the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). It enables developers to track user behavior, application events, and analytics data from server-side Java applications. The SDK comes in two main variants:

1. **JRE Java SDK** - The core SDK for tracking events in Java applications
2. **Ampli for Java SDK** - A strongly-typed wrapper around the core SDK that provides type safety for tracking events

## Key Features and Capabilities

- Event tracking with rich metadata
- User identification and user property management
- Batch processing of events
- Group analytics for tracking user cohorts
- Middleware support for customizing event processing
- HTTP proxy configuration
- Configurable event batching and flushing
- Thread management for asynchronous event processing
- Type-safe event tracking (with Ampli wrapper)

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Java SDK ecosystem consists of two main components that work together:

1. **JRE Java SDK (Core SDK)**: The foundation that handles the actual event tracking, batching, and sending to Amplitude's servers.

2. **Ampli for Java SDK**: A wrapper that sits on top of the core SDK, providing type safety and code generation based on your tracking plan defined in Amplitude.

The Ampli wrapper depends on the core SDK but adds the benefit of compile-time checking against your tracking plan. This ensures that events and properties match what's defined in your Amplitude data plan.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: An action that a user performs in your application that you want to track
- **Identify**: The process of associating analytics data with a specific user
- **User Properties**: Attributes associated with a user (e.g., name, email, preferences)
- **Event Properties**: Metadata associated with a specific event occurrence
- **Group**: A collection of users that can be analyzed together
- **Middleware**: Custom code that can intercept and modify events before they're sent to Amplitude
- **Batch Mode**: Processing multiple events together to reduce network requests
- **Flush**: The process of sending queued events to Amplitude's servers
- **Tracking Plan**: A schema that defines the expected events and properties in your analytics implementation
- **Ampli CLI**: Command-line tool for managing the Ampli wrapper and syncing with your tracking plan

## Integration and Usage

### JRE Java SDK Installation

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.amplitude</groupId>
    <artifactId>analytics-java</artifactId>
    <version>1.10.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### JRE Java SDK Initialization

```java
Amplitude amplitude = Amplitude.getInstance();
amplitude.init("API_KEY");
```

### Ampli for Java SDK Installation

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.amplitude</groupId>
    <artifactId>analytics-java</artifactId>
    <version>1.10.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### Ampli for Java SDK Initialization

```java
Ampli ampli = new Ampli();
ampli.load(new LoadOptions()
    .setApiKey("API_KEY")
    .setEnvironment(Environment.PRODUCTION));
```

## Key API Methods

### Core SDK Methods

- `amplitude.init(apiKey)` - Initialize the SDK
- `amplitude.track(event)` - Track an event
- `amplitude.identify(identify)` - Set user properties
- `amplitude.setGroup(groupType, groupName)` - Associate user with a group
- `amplitude.flush()` - Send queued events immediately
- `amplitude.shutdown()` - Flush events and shut down the SDK

### Ampli Wrapper Methods

- `ampli.load(options)` - Initialize the Ampli wrapper
- `ampli.identify(userId, identifyEvent)` - Identify a user with properties
- `ampli.track(event)` - Track a strongly-typed event
- `ampli.setGroup(groupType, groupName)` - Associate user with a group
- `ampli.flush()` - Send queued events immediately

### Ampli CLI Commands

- `ampli pull` - Pull the latest tracking plan from Amplitude
- `ampli status` - Check the status of the local tracking plan vs. Amplitude

## Configuration Options

The SDK offers extensive configuration options including:

- Custom event upload intervals
- Event batching settings
- HTTP proxy configuration
- Custom server URLs
- Thread timeout settings
- Custom HTTP headers
- Middleware for event processing
- Environment specification (development/production)

Both SDK variants support middleware for intercepting and modifying events before they're sent to Amplitude, allowing for custom processing, validation, or enrichment of analytics data.
