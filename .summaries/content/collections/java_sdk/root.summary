# Amplitude Java SDK

## Overview

The Amplitude Java SDK is a server-side analytics tracking solution for Java applications running on the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). It enables developers to track user behavior, application events, and analytics data from Java applications. The SDK is available in two variants:

1. **JRE Java SDK** - The core SDK for tracking events in Java applications
2. **Ampli for Java SDK** - A strongly-typed wrapper around the core SDK that provides type safety based on your tracking plan

## Key Features

- Event tracking with rich metadata
- User identification and property management
- Batch processing of events
- Group analytics for user cohorts
- Middleware support for customizing event processing
- HTTP proxy configuration
- Configurable event batching and flushing
- Thread management for asynchronous event processing
- Type-safe event tracking (with Ampli wrapper)

## Product Relationships

The Java SDK ecosystem consists of two main components:

1. **JRE Java SDK (Core SDK)**: The foundation that handles event tracking, batching, and sending to Amplitude's servers.

2. **Ampli for Java SDK**: A wrapper built on top of the core SDK that provides type safety and code generation based on your tracking plan defined in Amplitude.

The Ampli wrapper depends on the core SDK but adds compile-time checking against your tracking plan, ensuring events and properties match what's defined in your Amplitude data plan.

## Key Nomenclature

- **Event**: An action performed by a user that you want to track
- **Identify**: The process of associating analytics data with a specific user
- **User Properties**: Attributes associated with a user (e.g., name, email, preferences)
- **Event Properties**: Metadata associated with a specific event occurrence
- **Group**: A collection of users that can be analyzed together
- **Middleware**: Custom code that can intercept and modify events before they're sent to Amplitude
- **Batch Mode**: Processing multiple events together to reduce network requests
- **Flush**: The process of sending queued events to Amplitude's servers
- **Tracking Plan**: A schema defining the expected events and properties in your analytics implementation
- **Ampli CLI**: Command-line tool for managing the Ampli wrapper and syncing with your tracking plan

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Java SDK integrates into Amplitude's broader analytics platform:

1. Events tracked via the SDK appear in Amplitude's analytics dashboard
2. The Ampli wrapper connects with Amplitude's Data planning features
3. The SDK supports Amplitude's Group Analytics for B2B use cases
4. Events can be processed through Amplitude's event processing pipelines

The SDK is part of Amplitude's cross-platform tracking solution, allowing consistent event tracking across server-side Java applications and other client platforms.

## API and Implementation

### JRE Java SDK Installation
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.amplitude</groupId>
    <artifactId>analytics-java</artifactId>
    <version>1.10.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### JRE Java SDK Initialization
```java
Amplitude amplitude = Amplitude.getInstance();
amplitude.init("API_KEY");
```

### Ampli for Java SDK Installation
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.amplitude</groupId>
    <artifactId>analytics-java</artifactId>
    <version>1.10.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### Ampli for Java SDK Initialization
```java
Ampli ampli = new Ampli();
ampli.load(new LoadOptions()
    .setApiKey("API_KEY")
    .setEnvironment(Environment.PRODUCTION));
```

### Core SDK Methods
- `amplitude.init(apiKey)` - Initialize the SDK
- `amplitude.track(event)` - Track an event
- `amplitude.identify(identify)` - Set user properties
- `amplitude.setGroup(groupType, groupName)` - Associate user with a group
- `amplitude.flush()` - Send queued events immediately
- `amplitude.shutdown()` - Flush events and shut down the SDK

### Ampli Wrapper Methods
- `ampli.load(options)` - Initialize the Ampli wrapper
- `ampli.identify(userId, identifyEvent)` - Identify a user with properties
- `ampli.track(event)` - Track a strongly-typed event
- `ampli.setGroup(groupType, groupName)` - Associate user with a group
- `ampli.flush()` - Send queued events immediately

### Ampli CLI Commands
- `ampli pull` - Pull the latest tracking plan from Amplitude
- `ampli status` - Check the status of the local tracking plan vs. Amplitude

The SDK offers extensive configuration options including custom event upload intervals, event batching settings, HTTP proxy configuration, custom server URLs, thread timeout settings, custom HTTP headers, middleware for event processing, and environment specification.
