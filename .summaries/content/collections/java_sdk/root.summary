# Amplitude Java SDK Product Overview

The Amplitude Java SDK is a comprehensive analytics tracking solution for Java applications running on the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). It enables developers to track user behavior, application events, and analytics data in Java-based applications.

## Key Features and Concepts

- **Event Tracking**: Capture user interactions and application events
- **User Identification**: Associate events with specific users
- **Group Analytics**: Track user behavior within organizational groups
- **Batching**: Efficiently send events in batches to reduce network overhead
- **Middleware Support**: Customize event processing with middleware functions
- **Strongly-typed Event Tracking**: Use generated code from tracking plans for type safety
- **HTTP Proxy Support**: Configure custom HTTP proxies for event transmission
- **Flexible Configuration**: Customize SDK behavior with various configuration options

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Amplitude Java SDK consists of two main components:

1. **Core JRE Java SDK**: The foundational SDK for tracking events in Java applications
2. **Ampli for Java SDK**: A strongly-typed wrapper that works with tracking plans

These components work together in the following way:

- The Core JRE Java SDK provides the base functionality for event tracking
- Ampli for Java SDK extends this with type-safe event tracking based on a tracking plan
- The Ampli CLI tool manages the integration between your tracking plan and the SDK

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Tracking Plan**: A schema that defines expected events, their properties, and validation rules
- **Event**: A discrete user action or application occurrence that is tracked
- **Identify**: The process of associating a user ID with subsequent events
- **setGroup**: A method to associate a user with one or more groups
- **Middleware**: Functions that can process events before they're sent to Amplitude
- **Flush**: The process of sending batched events to Amplitude servers
- **EventOptions**: Configuration options for individual event tracking calls
- **AmplitudeCallbacks**: Interface for handling success and error responses from the API
- **Batch Mode**: Configuration for how events are grouped and sent to Amplitude

## Integration in Product Ecosystem

The Java SDK integrates with the broader Amplitude ecosystem:

- Works with Amplitude Analytics backend to store and process event data
- Integrates with Amplitude's tracking plan system for consistent event tracking
- Can be used alongside other Amplitude SDKs (Web, Mobile, etc.) for cross-platform analytics
- Supports the Amplitude Data governance features through event verification

## API and Usage Examples

### Core JRE Java SDK

```java
// Initialize the SDK
Amplitude amplitude = Amplitude.getInstance()
    .init("API_KEY")
    .setServerZone(ServerZone.EU) // Optional configuration
    .setUseBatch(true);

// Track an event
amplitude.track("Button Clicked", new JSONObject().put("buttonColor", "blue"));

// Identify a user
amplitude.setUserId("user@example.com");
amplitude.identify(new Identify().set("plan", "premium"));

// Track with groups
amplitude.setGroup("orgId", "15");
amplitude.groupIdentify("orgId", "15", new Identify().set("plan", "enterprise"));

// Flush events manually
amplitude.flush();
```

### Ampli for Java SDK

```java
// Initialize Ampli
Ampli ampli = new Ampli();
ampli.load(new LoadOptions().setEnvironment(Environment.PRODUCTION));

// Identify a user
ampli.identify("user@example.com", 
    new Identify().set("name", "User"),
    new EventOptions().setUserId("user-id"));

// Track a strongly-typed event
ampli.songPlayed("user-id", new SongPlayed()
    .setTitle("Song Title")
    .setArtist("Artist Name"));

// Flush events
ampli.flush();
```

### Ampli CLI Commands

```bash
# Pull tracking plan
ampli pull

# Check implementation status
ampli status
```
