## Amplitude Java SDK

The Amplitude Java SDK is a comprehensive analytics solution for Java applications running on JRE 6+ environments, designed to track user events and behaviors with robust configuration options and type-safe implementations. The SDK provides two primary approaches: a core Java SDK for flexible event tracking and an Ampli wrapper that generates strongly-typed code from Amplitude Data tracking plans.

## Product Relationship and Architecture

The Java SDK ecosystem consists of two complementary components that work together to provide comprehensive analytics capabilities:

**Core Java SDK (`com.amplitude:java-sdk`)**: The foundational analytics library that handles event collection, batching, and transmission to Amplitude's HTTP V2 API. This SDK provides the underlying infrastructure for event tracking, user identification, and data transmission.

**Ampli Wrapper (`com.amplitude.ampli`)**: A code generation layer built on top of the core SDK that creates strongly-typed event tracking methods from Amplitude Data tracking plans. The Ampli wrapper uses the `ampli CLI` to generate type-safe event classes and methods, ensuring consistency between tracking implementation and data schema definitions.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Event Tracking Concepts**:
- **Event Properties**: Custom data attached to events using JSONObject structures
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes associated with users across sessions
- **Group Identification**: Associating users with organizational entities using `setGroup(groupType, groupName)`
- **Device Information**: Hardware and software context data attached to events
- **Session ID**: Unique identifiers for user interaction sessions

**Configuration Components**:
- **LoadOptions/LoadClientOptions**: Configuration objects for SDK initialization and behavior
- **EventOptions**: Per-event configuration including middleware and custom properties
- **MiddlewareExtra**: Additional context data passed through the middleware pipeline
- **AmplitudeCallbacks**: Response handlers for server communication results

**Operational Elements**:
- **Batch Mode**: Automatic event grouping and transmission optimization
- **Event Upload Threshold**: Configurable limit triggering automatic event transmission
- **Event Upload Period**: Time-based intervals for automatic event flushing
- **Flush Operations**: Manual and automatic queue processing and transmission

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The Java SDK integrates into Amplitude's comprehensive analytics platform through several key touchpoints:

**Amplitude Data Integration**: The Ampli wrapper connects directly to Amplitude Data tracking plans, enabling schema-driven development where event structures are defined centrally and code is generated automatically using `ampli CLI pull` commands.

**HTTP V2 API Connectivity**: All event data flows through Amplitude's HTTP V2 API infrastructure, supporting batch transmission, custom headers, proxy configurations, and comprehensive error handling.

**Cross-Platform Consistency**: The SDK maintains compatibility with Amplitude's broader multi-platform ecosystem while providing Java-specific optimizations for JRE environments.

## API Endpoints and Command Line Operations

**CLI Operations**:
- `ampli pull`: Downloads and generates strongly-typed event classes from tracking plans
- `ampli status`: Verifies implementation completeness and schema compliance

**Core SDK Methods**:
- Event logging with properties, groups, and user data attachment
- `flush()`: Manual queue processing and transmission
- User identification and property management
- Group association using `setGroup()` operations
- Device information configuration and session management

**Configuration APIs**:
- API key initialization for project association
- Batch mode and threshold configuration
- HTTP proxy and custom header setup
- Middleware pipeline implementation for event processing
- Callback registration for server response handling
- Thread pool and timeout management

The SDK supports installation through standard Java dependency management systems (Maven/Gradle) and direct JAR file integration, with comprehensive configuration options for enterprise environments including proxy support, custom headers, and advanced batching strategies.
