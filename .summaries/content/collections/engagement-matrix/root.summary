# Engagement Matrix

## Overview

The Engagement Matrix is an analytical visualization tool in Amplitude designed to help product teams assess and optimize feature engagement. It presents events in a four-quadrant matrix based on two critical dimensions:

1. **Breadth** (x-axis): The percentage of active users performing an event (measured as %DAU/WAU/MAU)
2. **Frequency** (y-axis): How often users perform an event, measured either as "Average Times Performed" or "Average Days Performed"

This visualization enables teams to quickly identify high and low-performing features, prioritize development efforts, and make data-driven product decisions by visually representing how users engage with different aspects of a product.

## Key Features and Functionality

- **Quadrant-Based Visualization**: Events are plotted across four meaningful quadrants representing different types of feature engagement
- **Flexible Metrics**: Options to choose between different time frames (daily, weekly, monthly) and frequency metrics (times performed vs. days performed)
- **Scaling Options**: Support for both logarithmic and linear scales to better visualize data with wide ranges
- **Top and Bottom Events**: Ability to focus analysis on the highest or lowest performing events
- **Zoom Functionality**: Users can zoom in on specific clusters of data points for detailed analysis
- **Breakdown Table**: Provides detailed metrics for each plotted event

## Quadrant Interpretation

The Engagement Matrix categorizes features into four strategic categories:

1. **Core Features** (High Breadth, High Frequency): Features used by many users frequently, representing the product's essential value
2. **Power Features** (Low Breadth, High Frequency): Features used intensively by a smaller subset of users, often representing advanced functionality
3. **One-Time Events** (High Breadth, Low Frequency): Features used by many users but infrequently, such as onboarding steps or occasional actions
4. **Underperforming Features** (Low Breadth, Low Frequency): Features with limited usage that may need improvement or reconsideration

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **%DAU/WAU/MAU**: Percentage of Daily/Weekly/Monthly Active Users performing an event
- **Average Times Performed**: The average number of times users perform an event in the selected time period
- **Average Days Performed**: The average number of days users perform an event in the selected time period
- **Breadth**: The horizontal axis measuring the percentage of active users performing an event
- **Frequency**: The vertical axis measuring how often users perform an event
- **Data Point Clusters**: Groups of events with similar engagement patterns

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Engagement Matrix is available to users on Amplitude's Growth and Enterprise plans. It integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem, allowing teams to:

- Track feature performance over time
- Segment users based on feature engagement patterns
- Inform product roadmap decisions with usage data
- Validate the impact of product changes

The tool leverages Amplitude's event tracking infrastructure to generate visualizations based on user-defined parameters, making it a valuable component in Amplitude's suite of product analytics tools.

## Use Cases

- Identifying which features drive core product value
- Discovering underutilized features that need promotion or improvement
- Recognizing power features that could be expanded to more users
- Prioritizing product development based on actual usage patterns
- Tracking the impact of feature changes over time
- Comparing feature engagement across different user segments
