# Engagement Matrix Product Overview

## Product Overview

The Engagement Matrix is an analytical visualization tool within Amplitude that helps product teams assess feature engagement across their applications. It plots events (representing features or user actions) on a four-quadrant matrix based on two key dimensions:

1. **Breadth** - The percentage of active users performing an event (% of DAU/WAU/MAU)
2. **Frequency** - How often users perform the event, measured as either:
   - Average Times Performed
   - Average Days Performed

This visualization enables teams to quickly identify high and low-performing features, prioritize product development efforts, and make data-driven decisions about feature enhancement or deprecation.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Four-Quadrant Visualization

The matrix organizes events into four distinct quadrants:

1. **High Breadth, High Frequency (Top Right)** - Core features used frequently by many users
2. **High Breadth, Low Frequency (Bottom Right)** - Widely adopted features used infrequently
3. **Low Breadth, High Frequency (Top Left)** - Power features used heavily by a small subset of users
4. **Low Breadth, Low Frequency (Bottom Left)** - Underutilized features that may need improvement or consideration for deprecation

### Scaling and Visualization Options

- **Log/Linear scale** - Toggle between logarithmic and linear scales to better visualize data with wide ranges
- **Zoom functionality** - Focus on specific clusters of data points
- **Data point clusters** - Visual representation of event groupings based on performance
- **Top and Bottom Events** - Ability to highlight best and worst performing events

### Data Analysis Features

- **Breakdown table** - Provides detailed metrics for each plotted event

## Product Relationships and Ecosystem Integration

The Engagement Matrix is available to users on Amplitude's Growth and Enterprise plans. It integrates with Amplitude's broader product analytics ecosystem, allowing teams to:

1. Analyze feature engagement across their application
2. Make data-driven decisions about product development
3. Complement other Amplitude analytics tools for comprehensive product understanding

The tool serves as a strategic component within Amplitude's suite of analytics products, helping teams visualize engagement patterns that might be difficult to identify through other analytics views.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Breadth**: Percentage of active users performing an event (% DAU/WAU/MAU)
- **Frequency**: How often users perform an event (Average Times/Days Performed)
- **Core Features**: High breadth, high frequency events that are central to the product experience
- **Power Features**: Low breadth, high frequency events used intensively by a subset of users
- **Underutilized Features**: Low breadth, low frequency events that may need improvement
- **Data Point Clusters**: Groupings of events with similar engagement patterns
- **Breakdown Table**: Detailed metrics view for individual events plotted on the matrix

## Use Cases

The Engagement Matrix helps product teams:

1. Identify core features driving user engagement
2. Discover power features used by specific user segments
3. Detect underutilized features needing improvement
4. Find candidates for feature deprecation
5. Prioritize product development efforts based on actual usage data
6. Track the impact of feature changes over time

The Engagement Matrix ultimately serves as a visual decision-making tool that transforms complex usage data into actionable insights for product optimization.
