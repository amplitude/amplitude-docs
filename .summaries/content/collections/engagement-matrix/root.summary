## Amplitude Engagement Matrix

The Amplitude Engagement Matrix is a sophisticated analytics visualization tool that enables product teams to analyze feature engagement patterns through a four-quadrant matrix system. This advanced chart type measures feature performance across two critical dimensions: breadth (user adoption percentage) and frequency (usage intensity), supporting analysis of up to 100 events simultaneously for comprehensive product feature audits.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Engagement Matrix functions as a specialized chart type within Amplitude's analytics platform, specifically engineered for feature engagement analysis. The system integrates multiple analytical components to provide comprehensive engagement insights:

**Core Visualization Components:**
- **Matrix Visualization Engine**: Four-quadrant display system with configurable scaling options (logarithmic vs linear)
- **Event Selection System**: Supports Top Events, Bottom Events, and custom event curation for targeted analysis
- **Breakdown Analysis Table**: Tabular data view with CSV export functionality for detailed examination
- **Interactive Analysis Tools**: Zoom capabilities and clustering tools for examining related event groups

**Data Processing Architecture:**
The system processes event data through Amplitude's core instrumentation infrastructure, applying statistical analysis to determine quadrant positioning based on user-defined or system-calculated boundaries using median vs average sectioning methodologies.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Engagement Metrics Framework:**

*Breadth Metrics* (User Adoption Measurement):
- **%MAU (Monthly Active Users)**: Percentage of monthly active users engaging with specific features
- **%WAU (Weekly Active Users)**: Weekly engagement penetration rates across the user base
- **%DAU (Daily Active Users)**: Daily feature adoption percentages

*Frequency Metrics* (Usage Intensity Measurement):
- **Average Times Performed**: Mean frequency of event execution per user within the analysis period
- **Average Days Performed**: Average number of days users engage with specific features

**Matrix Quadrant Classifications:**
- **High Frequency + High User Count**: Core features demonstrating broad, intensive usage patterns
- **High Frequency + Low User Count**: Power features with intensive usage by smaller, specialized user segments
- **Low Frequency + High User Count**: Features with broad but shallow engagement patterns
- **Low Frequency + Low User Count**: Underperforming or highly niche features requiring strategic evaluation

**Analysis Methodologies:**
- **Median vs Average Sectioning**: Statistical approaches for determining quadrant boundary calculations
- **Cross-sectional Gray Lines**: Visual boundary indicators separating matrix quadrants
- **Cluster Analysis**: Methodology for grouping and examining related events within specific quadrants
