# Engagement Matrix Product Overview

## Product Overview

The Engagement Matrix is an analytical chart feature within Amplitude that helps product teams evaluate and visualize feature engagement across their product. It plots events (representing product features or user actions) on a four-quadrant matrix based on two key dimensions:

1. **Breadth** (x-axis): The percentage of active users who perform the event (measured as %DAU/WAU/MAU)
2. **Frequency** (y-axis): How often users perform the event, measured either as "Average Times Performed" or "Average Days Performed"

This visualization enables teams to quickly identify which features are performing well and which may need improvement, supporting data-driven product decisions.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Four-Quadrant Visualization

The Engagement Matrix categorizes features/events into four distinct quadrants:

- **Top Right (High Breadth, High Frequency)**: Core features that are widely adopted and frequently used
- **Top Left (Low Breadth, High Frequency)**: Power user features used intensively by a small subset of users
- **Bottom Right (High Breadth, Low Frequency)**: Features with wide adoption but infrequent use
- **Bottom Left (Low Breadth, Low Frequency)**: Underperforming features that may need improvement or reconsideration

### Analysis Tools

- **Breakdown Table**: Provides detailed metrics for each plotted event
- **Zooming Functionality**: Allows users to focus on specific data clusters for more detailed analysis
- **Scale Options**: Supports both logarithmic and linear scales for better visualization of data with wide ranges
- **Top and Bottom Events**: Ability to filter and focus on the highest or lowest performing events

## Product Relationships and Features

The Engagement Matrix is available to users on Amplitude's Growth and Enterprise plans, positioning it as an advanced analytical tool within the Amplitude product suite. It serves as a complementary feature to Amplitude's core analytics capabilities, providing specialized visualization for feature engagement patterns.

The matrix works by analyzing event data collected through Amplitude's tracking system, transforming raw usage data into actionable insights about feature performance. It integrates with Amplitude's broader event tracking and user segmentation capabilities to provide context-rich analysis.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Breadth**: The percentage of active users who perform a specific event
- **%DAU/WAU/MAU**: Percentage of Daily/Weekly/Monthly Active Users who perform an event
- **Frequency**: How often users perform an event
- **Average Times Performed**: The average number of times users perform an event
- **Average Days Performed**: The average number of days users perform an event
- **Data Point Clusters**: Groups of events with similar engagement patterns
- **Core Features**: Features with high breadth and high frequency
- **Power User Features**: Features with low breadth but high frequency

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Engagement Matrix fits into Amplitude's product analytics ecosystem as a specialized visualization tool focused on feature engagement analysis. It helps bridge the gap between raw usage data and strategic product decisions by providing clear visual patterns of user engagement.

Within the broader Amplitude platform, the Engagement Matrix likely works alongside:

1. **Event Tracking**: Utilizing the same event data that powers other Amplitude analytics
2. **User Segmentation**: Allowing analysis of feature engagement across different user segments
3. **Product Analytics**: Complementing other visualization tools with its specific focus on feature engagement patterns
4. **Strategic Decision Support**: Providing data-driven insights for product roadmap prioritization

The tool appears to be accessed through Amplitude's web interface as an analytical chart type, where users configure parameters such as event selection, metric choices, scale types, and filtering options to generate insights about feature engagement patterns.
