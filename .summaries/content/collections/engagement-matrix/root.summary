## Amplitude Engagement Matrix

The Engagement Matrix is an advanced analytics chart feature within Amplitude that provides comprehensive analysis of product feature engagement through a sophisticated four-quadrant visualization system. This tool enables product teams to understand how different features perform across two critical dimensions: breadth (percentage of active users) and frequency (usage intensity), supporting analysis of up to 100 events simultaneously.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

The Engagement Matrix operates as a specialized chart type within Amplitude's broader analytics platform, specifically designed for feature engagement analysis. It integrates with Amplitude's core event tracking infrastructure and user segmentation capabilities, requiring proper event instrumentation to function effectively. The feature is available exclusively on Growth and Enterprise plans, positioning it as an advanced analytics tool for sophisticated product analysis.

The matrix works in conjunction with Amplitude's standard analytics charts and supports account-level reporting, allowing teams to analyze engagement patterns across different user segments and time periods. The tool includes CSV export functionality for further analysis and integrates with Amplitude's breakdown table operations for detailed data exploration.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Engagement Matrix Chart**: The primary four-quadrant visualization that plots events based on breadth and frequency metrics.

**Breadth Metrics**: Measured as percentage of Daily Active Users (DAU), Weekly Active Users (WAU), or Monthly Active Users (MAU) who engage with specific features.

**Frequency Metrics**: Quantified through two approaches:
- Average Times Performed per day
- Average Days Performed within the analysis period

**Four Quadrants Classification**:
- **High Frequency, High User Count**: Core features with broad adoption and intensive usage
- **High Frequency, Low User Count**: Power features used intensively by smaller user segments
- **Low Frequency, High User Count**: Features with broad but shallow engagement
- **Low Frequency, Low User Count**: Underperforming or niche features

**Sectioning Options**: Data can be divided using either median or average calculations to determine quadrant boundaries.

**Cross-sectional Gray Lines**: Visual indicators that separate the four quadrants based on the selected sectioning method.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Engagement Matrix fits into Amplitude's comprehensive product analytics ecosystem as a specialized tool for feature performance evaluation. It complements other Amplitude analytics capabilities by providing a unique perspective on feature engagement that goes beyond simple usage metrics. The tool requires robust event instrumentation and works best when integrated with Amplitude's user segmentation and cohort analysis features.

The matrix supports both log and linear scale visualizations, allowing teams to analyze data across different magnitudes of usage. Its integration with breakdown tables and CSV export capabilities ensures that insights can be further analyzed and shared across product teams.

## Technical Capabilities

The Engagement Matrix supports several technical configurations:
- Analysis of up to 100 events in a single view
- DAU/WAU/MAU time period selections
- Median vs. average sectioning for quadrant determination
- Log vs. linear scale visualization options
- Cluster zoom functionality for detailed analysis of grouped events
- Event deselection capabilities for focused analysis
- CSV export for external data processing
- Breakdown table operations with column manipulation features

The tool enables teams to identify top and bottom performing events, analyze feature clusters, and make data-driven decisions about product development priorities based on comprehensive engagement patterns rather than single-dimensional metrics.
