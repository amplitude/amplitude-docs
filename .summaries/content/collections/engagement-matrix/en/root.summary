# Engagement Matrix

## Overview

The Engagement Matrix is an analytical visualization tool in Amplitude that helps product teams assess and optimize feature engagement. It plots events on a four-quadrant matrix based on two key dimensions:

1. **Breadth** (x-axis): The percentage of active users performing an event (measured as %DAU/WAU/MAU)
2. **Frequency** (y-axis): How often users perform an event, measured either as "Average Times Performed" or "Average Days Performed"

This visualization enables teams to quickly identify high and low-performing features, prioritize development efforts, and make data-driven product decisions.

## Key Features and Functionality

- **Quadrant-Based Visualization**: Events are plotted across four meaningful quadrants that represent different types of feature engagement
- **Flexible Metrics**: Users can choose between different time frames (daily, weekly, monthly) and frequency metrics (times performed vs. days performed)
- **Scaling Options**: Supports both logarithmic and linear scales for better visualization of data with wide ranges
- **Top and Bottom Events**: Ability to focus on the highest or lowest performing events
- **Zoom Functionality**: Users can zoom in on specific clusters of data points for detailed analysis
- **Breakdown Table**: Provides detailed metrics for each plotted event

## Quadrant Interpretation

The Engagement Matrix divides features into four strategic categories:

1. **Core Features** (High Breadth, High Frequency): Features used by many users frequently, representing the product's essential value
2. **Power Features** (Low Breadth, High Frequency): Features used intensively by a smaller subset of users, often representing advanced functionality
3. **One-Time Events** (High Breadth, Low Frequency): Features used by many users but infrequently, such as onboarding steps or occasional actions
4. **Underperforming Features** (Low Breadth, Low Frequency): Features with limited usage that may need improvement or reconsideration

## Use Cases

- Identifying which features drive core product value
- Discovering underutilized features that need promotion or improvement
- Recognizing power features that could be expanded to more users
- Prioritizing product development based on actual usage patterns
- Tracking the impact of feature changes over time
- Comparing feature engagement across different user segments

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Engagement Matrix is available to users on Amplitude's Growth and Enterprise plans. It integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem, allowing teams to:

- Track feature performance over time
- Segment users based on feature engagement patterns
- Inform product roadmap decisions with usage data
- Validate the impact of product changes

## Technical Implementation

The Engagement Matrix chart can be accessed through Amplitude's analytics interface. While specific API endpoints aren't detailed in the provided documentation, the tool appears to leverage Amplitude's event tracking infrastructure to generate the visualization based on user-defined parameters.

## Key Nomenclature

- **%DAU/WAU/MAU**: Percentage of Daily/Weekly/Monthly Active Users performing an event
- **Average Times Performed**: The average number of times users perform an event in the selected time period
- **Average Days Performed**: The average number of days users perform an event in the selected time period
- **Breadth**: The horizontal axis measuring the percentage of active users performing an event
- **Frequency**: The vertical axis measuring how often users perform an event
- **Data Point Clusters**: Groups of events with similar engagement patterns
