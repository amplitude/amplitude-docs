# Engagement Matrix Product Overview

## Product Overview

The Engagement Matrix is an analytical tool within Amplitude that helps product teams evaluate feature engagement by visualizing events on a four-quadrant matrix. This visualization plots product features and user actions based on two key dimensions:

1. **Breadth** (x-axis): The percentage of active users who perform an event (measured as %DAU/WAU/MAU)
2. **Frequency** (y-axis): How often users perform an event, measured either as "Average Times Performed" or "Average Days Performed"

The resulting matrix provides a strategic framework for understanding feature performance, identifying core features, and prioritizing product improvements based on actual usage patterns.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Four-Quadrant Visualization

The Engagement Matrix organizes events into four distinct quadrants that represent different engagement patterns:

- **Top-right quadrant**: High breadth, high frequency - Core features that are widely adopted and frequently used
- **Top-left quadrant**: Low breadth, high frequency - Niche features used intensively by a small subset of users
- **Bottom-right quadrant**: High breadth, low frequency - Features with wide adoption but infrequent usage
- **Bottom-left quadrant**: Low breadth, low frequency - Features with limited adoption and infrequent usage

### Measurement Options

- **Breadth metrics**: Percentage of Daily Active Users (%DAU), Weekly Active Users (%WAU), or Monthly Active Users (%MAU)
- **Frequency metrics**: 
  - "Average Times Performed" - average number of times users perform an event
  - "Average Days Performed" - average number of days users perform an event

### Visualization Controls

- **Scale options**: Log or Linear scale for better visualization of data with wide ranges
- **Zooming functionality**: Ability to zoom in on clusters of data points for more detailed analysis
- **Breakdown table**: Provides detailed metrics for each event plotted on the matrix

## Use Cases

The Engagement Matrix is designed to help product teams:

1. Identify core features that drive user engagement
2. Discover underperforming features that need improvement or reconsideration
3. Recognize niche features that might benefit from broader promotion
4. Make data-driven decisions about feature development and resource allocation
5. Track changes in feature engagement over time

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Engagement Matrix is available to users on Amplitude's Growth and Enterprise plans. It integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem by:

- Using the same event data that powers other Amplitude analytics features
- Providing complementary insights to other Amplitude visualization tools
- Supporting strategic product decisions with quantitative engagement metrics

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Events**: User actions or interactions tracked within a product
- **Breadth**: The percentage of active users who perform a specific event
- **Frequency**: How often users perform a specific event
- **%DAU/WAU/MAU**: Percentage of Daily/Weekly/Monthly Active Users who perform an event
- **Average Times Performed**: The average number of times users perform an event
- **Average Days Performed**: The average number of days users perform an event
- **Top Events**: Features with high engagement metrics
- **Bottom Events**: Features with low engagement metrics
- **Data point clusters**: Groups of events with similar engagement patterns

## Technical Implementation

The Engagement Matrix chart can be accessed through the Amplitude interface. While specific API endpoints or command line invocations aren't explicitly mentioned in the documentation, users interact with the tool through Amplitude's web interface, where they can:

- Select events to analyze
- Choose appropriate breadth and frequency metrics
- Adjust visualization settings (log/linear scale)
- Zoom in on specific areas of the chart
- View detailed breakdowns of event metrics

The tool provides both visual insights through the matrix itself and detailed quantitative data through the accompanying breakdown table.
