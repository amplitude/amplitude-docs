## Amplitude Engagement Matrix

The Engagement Matrix is an advanced analytics chart feature within Amplitude that provides comprehensive analysis of feature engagement patterns through a sophisticated four-quadrant visualization system. This tool enables product teams to understand how different features and events perform across two critical dimensions: breadth (percentage of active users) and frequency (usage intensity over time).

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Engagement Matrix operates as a specialized chart type within Amplitude's broader analytics platform, designed specifically for feature engagement analysis. The system supports analysis of up to 100 events simultaneously, making it suitable for comprehensive product feature audits and strategic decision-making.

### Core Components:
- **Matrix Visualization Engine**: Four-quadrant display system with configurable scaling (log vs linear)
- **Event Selection System**: Supports Top Events, Bottom Events, and custom event curation
- **Breakdown Analysis Table**: Tabular view with CSV export capabilities for detailed data examination
- **Zoom and Clustering Tools**: Interactive analysis capabilities for examining event clusters

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Engagement Metrics:
- **Breadth Metrics**: Measure user adoption across the user base
  - **%MAU (Monthly Active Users)**: Percentage of monthly active users engaging with specific features
  - **%WAU (Weekly Active Users)**: Weekly engagement penetration rates
  - **%DAU (Daily Active Users)**: Daily feature adoption percentages

- **Frequency Metrics**: Measure usage intensity and engagement depth
  - **Average Times Performed**: Mean frequency of event execution per user
  - **Average Days Performed**: Average number of days users engage with features

### Matrix Quadrants:
- **High Frequency + High User Count**: Core features with broad, intensive usage
- **High Frequency + Low User Count**: Power features used intensively by smaller user segments
- **Low Frequency + High User Count**: Broad but shallow engagement features
- **Low Frequency + Low User Count**: Underperforming or niche features

### Analysis Methodologies:
- **Median vs Average Sectioning**: Statistical approaches for quadrant boundary determination
- **Cross-sectional Gray Lines**: Visual indicators for quadrant boundaries
- **Cluster Analysis**: Grouping and examination of related events within quadrants

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Engagement Matrix integrates deeply within Amplitude's analytics ecosystem, leveraging the platform's core event instrumentation and user segmentation capabilities. It operates on the same foundational data model as other Amplitude charts while providing specialized visualization for engagement analysis.

### Platform Integration Points:
- **Event Instrumentation**: Relies on Amplitude's event tracking infrastructure
- **User Segmentation**: Supports account-level reporting and custom user segment analysis
- **Data Export**: Integrates with Amplitude's broader data export capabilities through CSV functionality
- **Plan Availability**: Available on Growth and Enterprise plans, indicating its position as an advanced analytics feature

### Analytical Workflow:
1. **Discovery Phase**: Initial feature engagement pattern identification using the matrix view
2. **Interpretation Phase**: Quadrant analysis and feature categorization
3. **Deep Dive Analysis**: Breakdown table examination and cluster zoom functionality
4. **Data Export**: CSV export for further analysis and reporting

The Engagement Matrix serves as a strategic tool for product managers and analysts to make data-driven decisions about feature development, user experience optimization, and resource allocation based on comprehensive engagement pattern analysis.
