# Engagement Matrix Product Overview

## Product Overview

The Engagement Matrix is an analytical tool within Amplitude that helps product teams visualize and assess feature engagement across their applications. It plots events (representing features or user actions) on a four-quadrant matrix based on two key dimensions:

1. **Breadth** - The percentage of active users performing an event (% of DAU/WAU/MAU)
2. **Frequency** - How often users perform the event, measured as either:
   - Average Times Performed
   - Average Days Performed

This visualization enables teams to quickly identify high and low-performing features, prioritize product development efforts, and make data-driven decisions about feature enhancement or deprecation.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Four-Quadrant Visualization

The Engagement Matrix organizes events into four distinct quadrants, each representing different combinations of user adoption and usage frequency:

1. **High Breadth, High Frequency (Top Right)** - Core features used frequently by many users
2. **High Breadth, Low Frequency (Bottom Right)** - Widely adopted features used infrequently
3. **Low Breadth, High Frequency (Top Left)** - Power features used heavily by a small subset of users
4. **Low Breadth, Low Frequency (Bottom Left)** - Underutilized features that may need improvement or consideration for deprecation

### Scaling Options

- **Log/Linear scale** - Users can toggle between logarithmic and linear scales to better visualize data with wide ranges
- **Zoom functionality** - Allows users to focus on specific clusters of data points

### Data Analysis Features

- **Breakdown table** - Provides detailed metrics for each plotted event
- **Top and Bottom Events** - Ability to highlight best and worst performing events
- **Data point clusters** - Visual representation of event groupings based on performance

## Use Cases

The Engagement Matrix is designed to help product teams:

1. Identify core features that drive user engagement
2. Discover power features used by specific user segments
3. Detect underutilized features that need improvement
4. Find candidates for feature deprecation
5. Prioritize product development efforts based on actual usage data
6. Track the impact of feature changes over time

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Engagement Matrix is available to users on Amplitude's Growth and Enterprise plans. It integrates with Amplitude's broader product analytics ecosystem, allowing teams to:

1. Analyze feature engagement across their application
2. Make data-driven decisions about product development
3. Complement other Amplitude analytics tools for comprehensive product understanding

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Breadth**: Percentage of active users performing an event (% DAU/WAU/MAU)
- **Frequency**: How often users perform an event (Average Times/Days Performed)
- **Core Features**: High breadth, high frequency events that are central to the product experience
- **Power Features**: Low breadth, high frequency events used intensively by a subset of users
- **Underutilized Features**: Low breadth, low frequency events that may need improvement
- **Data Point Clusters**: Groupings of events with similar engagement patterns
- **Breakdown Table**: Detailed metrics view for individual events plotted on the matrix

The Engagement Matrix serves as a strategic tool for product teams to visualize, analyze, and optimize feature engagement, ultimately helping to create more engaging and effective products based on actual user behavior.
