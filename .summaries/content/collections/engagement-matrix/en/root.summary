# Amplitude Engagement Matrix

## Overview

The Engagement Matrix is an analytical tool within Amplitude that helps product teams visualize and assess feature engagement across their product. It plots product features or events on a four-quadrant matrix based on two key dimensions:

1. **Breadth** (x-axis): The percentage of active users engaging with a feature (measured as %DAU/WAU/MAU)
2. **Frequency** (y-axis): How often users engage with a feature (measured as average times performed or average days performed)

This visualization enables teams to quickly identify which features are driving engagement, which are underperforming, and where to focus optimization efforts.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Four-Quadrant Categorization

The Engagement Matrix divides features into four distinct quadrants:

- **Top Right (High Breadth, High Frequency)**: Core features that are widely adopted and frequently used
- **Top Left (Low Breadth, High Frequency)**: Power features used intensively by a smaller subset of users
- **Bottom Right (High Breadth, Low Frequency)**: Features with wide adoption but infrequent usage
- **Bottom Left (Low Breadth, Low Frequency)**: Underperforming features that may need improvement or reconsideration

### Visualization Options

- **Scale Options**: Toggle between log and linear scale for better visualization
- **Metric Selection**: Choose between "Average Times Performed" or "Average Days Performed" for the frequency metric
- **Zooming Functionality**: Zoom in on specific clusters of data points for detailed analysis
- **CSV Export**: Export the matrix data for further analysis in external tools

### Breakdown Table

The Engagement Matrix includes a detailed breakdown table that provides:
- Specific metrics for each feature/event
- Sorting capabilities to identify top and bottom events
- Additional context for making data-driven decisions

## Use Cases

The Engagement Matrix helps product teams:

1. **Identify Core Features**: Recognize which features are central to the user experience
2. **Discover Power Features**: Find features that highly engaged users leverage intensively
3. **Prioritize Feature Development**: Make data-driven decisions about which features to enhance, promote, or potentially deprecate
4. **Track Feature Performance**: Monitor how changes to features impact user engagement over time

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Engagement Matrix is part of Amplitude's analytics suite and is available to users on Growth and Enterprise plans. It complements other Amplitude analytics tools by providing a specific lens focused on feature engagement patterns.

## Key Nomenclature

- **Breadth**: The percentage of active users who use a feature
- **Frequency**: How often users engage with a feature
- **%DAU/WAU/MAU**: Percentage of Daily/Weekly/Monthly Active Users who engage with a feature
- **Average Times Performed**: The average number of times a user performs an action
- **Average Days Performed**: The average number of days a user performs an action
- **Top Events**: Features with high engagement metrics
- **Bottom Events**: Features with low engagement metrics

The Engagement Matrix serves as a strategic tool for product teams to understand feature performance, identify opportunities for improvement, and make informed decisions about product development priorities.
