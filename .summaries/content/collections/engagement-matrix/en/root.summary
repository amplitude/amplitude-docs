# Engagement Matrix Product Overview

## Product Overview

The Engagement Matrix is an analytical chart feature within Amplitude that helps product teams evaluate and visualize feature engagement across their product. It plots events (representing product features or user actions) on a four-quadrant matrix based on two key dimensions:

1. **Breadth** (x-axis): The percentage of active users who perform the event (measured as %DAU/WAU/MAU)
2. **Frequency** (y-axis): How often users perform the event, measured either as "Average Times Performed" or "Average Days Performed"

This visualization enables teams to quickly identify which features are performing well and which may need improvement, supporting data-driven product decisions.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Four-Quadrant Visualization

The Engagement Matrix categorizes features/events into four distinct quadrants:

- **Top Right (High Breadth, High Frequency)**: Core features that are widely adopted and frequently used
- **Top Left (Low Breadth, High Frequency)**: Power user features used intensively by a small subset of users
- **Bottom Right (High Breadth, Low Frequency)**: Features with wide adoption but infrequent use
- **Bottom Left (Low Breadth, Low Frequency)**: Underperforming features that may need improvement or reconsideration

### Analysis Tools

- **Breakdown Table**: Provides detailed metrics for each plotted event
- **Zooming Functionality**: Allows users to focus on specific data clusters for more detailed analysis
- **Scale Options**: Supports both logarithmic and linear scales for better visualization of data with wide ranges
- **Top and Bottom Events**: Ability to filter and focus on the highest or lowest performing events

### Use Cases

- Identifying core product features that drive engagement
- Discovering underutilized features that need promotion or improvement
- Recognizing power user features for potential expansion
- Prioritizing feature improvements based on engagement patterns
- Comparing feature performance across different user segments

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Breadth**: The percentage of active users who perform a specific event
- **%DAU/WAU/MAU**: Percentage of Daily/Weekly/Monthly Active Users who perform an event
- **Frequency**: How often users perform an event
- **Average Times Performed**: The average number of times users perform an event
- **Average Days Performed**: The average number of days users perform an event
- **Data Point Clusters**: Groups of events with similar engagement patterns
- **Core Features**: Features with high breadth and high frequency
- **Power User Features**: Features with low breadth but high frequency

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Engagement Matrix is available to users on Amplitude's Growth and Enterprise plans, indicating it's a more advanced analytical tool within the Amplitude product suite. It complements other Amplitude analytics features by providing a specialized view focused specifically on feature engagement patterns.

The tool appears to be part of Amplitude's broader product analytics ecosystem, helping teams make strategic decisions about feature development, user experience improvements, and product roadmap prioritization based on actual usage data.

## Technical Implementation

The documentation doesn't specify API endpoints or command line invocations for the Engagement Matrix. It appears to be primarily accessed through Amplitude's web interface as an analytical chart type, where users can configure parameters such as:

- Selecting events to analyze
- Choosing between breadth and frequency metrics
- Setting scale types (logarithmic or linear)
- Filtering for top or bottom events
- Using zooming tools to focus on specific data clusters

Users interact with the visualization and its accompanying breakdown table to derive insights about feature engagement patterns.
