## Summary
This documentation covers the `ugcFilterRules` feature in Amplitude's Session Replay SDK, which uses glob patterns with wildcard matching to detect and sanitize sensitive user-generated content in URLs during session replay and heatmap recording. The feature is configured within `interactionConfig` and applies URL replacement rules with `selector` (glob pattern) and `replacement` (sanitized text) properties.
