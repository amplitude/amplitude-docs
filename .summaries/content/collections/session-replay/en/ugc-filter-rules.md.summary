## Summary
This documentation covers the `ugcFilterRules` feature in Amplitude's Session Replay SDK, which uses glob patterns with wildcards to detect and sanitize sensitive user-generated content in URLs during session replay and heatmap recording. The feature is configured within `interactionConfig` and applies URL pattern matching rules with `selector` (glob pattern) and `replacement` (sanitized text) properties to anonymize user IDs, company names, and sensitive query parameters.
