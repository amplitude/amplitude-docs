# Amplitude Session Replay

Amplitude Session Replay is a comprehensive user behavior analytics solution that captures and reconstructs user interactions across web, mobile (iOS/Android), and React Native applications. The product provides visual insights through session recordings, heatmaps, and behavioral analysis while maintaining strict privacy controls and compliance with data protection regulations like GDPR.

## Core Features and Capabilities

**Session Recording & Playback**: Captures DOM interactions, user clicks, scrolls, and form inputs through diff-based replay construction that reconstructs user sessions without storing full page snapshots. The system uses view tree capture for mobile platforms and DOM capture for web applications.

**Heatmaps & Visual Analytics**: Provides click maps, selector maps, and scroll maps that visualize user engagement patterns, element ranking, and scroll depth analysis. Heatmaps integrate with Microscope analysis capabilities and support behavioral cohort segmentation.

**Privacy & Compliance Framework**: Implements three-tier masking levels (Conservative, Light, Medium) with CSS selector-based overrides, custom masking controls, and comprehensive consent management integration with Cookie Management Platforms (CMPs).

**Multi-Platform SDK Architecture**: Supports web browsers, iOS/iPadOS, Android, and React Native with plugin-based architecture for existing Amplitude implementations and standalone SDKs for third-party analytics integrations.

## Product Architecture and Integration Patterns

The Session Replay ecosystem follows a modular architecture with distinct integration patterns:

**Plugin Architecture**: For applications already using Amplitude SDKs, Session Replay integrates as plugins (`SessionReplayPlugin`, `AmplitudeSwiftSessionReplayPlugin`, `SessionReplayMiddleware`) that extend existing analytics implementations.

**Standalone SDKs**: Independent implementations for applications using third-party analytics providers (Segment, Rudderstack) requiring manual session/device ID synchronization and explicit event property injection.

**Wrapper Integrations**: Specialized connectors for analytics platforms like Segment (`@amplitude/segment-session-replay-plugin`) and Rudderstack that provide one-line integration with automatic Session Replay ID injection.

**Google Tag Manager Support**: GTM Web Template enables Session Replay deployment through tag management systems with client-side browser implementations.

## Key Technical Components and APIs

**Core SDK Packages**:
- `@amplitude/plugin-session-replay-browser` - Browser SDK Plugin
- `@amplitude/session-replay-browser` - Standalone Browser SDK
- `plugin-session-replay-android` / `middleware-session-replay-android` - Android implementations
- `@amplitude/plugin-session-replay-react-native` - React Native plugin

**Configuration APIs**:
- `sampleRate` - Controls recording frequency (0.0-1.0)
- `privacyConfig` / `maskLevel` - Data masking configuration
- `serverZone` - EU data residency support
- `enableRemoteConfig` - Remote configuration management
- `optOut` - User consent controls

**Session Management Methods**:
- `setSessionId()` / `setDeviceId()` - Manual ID management
- `getSessionReplayProperties()` - Event property injection
- `start()` / `stop()` - Recording control
- `flush()` - Data transmission

**Privacy Controls**:
- `AmpMaskView` component (React Native)
- `.amp-block` CSS class exclusion
- `ugcFilterRules` - URL sanitization with glob patterns
- CSS selector-based masking overrides

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Diff-based Replay**: Recording methodology that captures only changes between states rather than full page snapshots, reducing data volume while maintaining reconstruction fidelity.

**View Tree Capture**: Mobile-specific recording technique that captures the hierarchical structure of UI components for iOS and Android applications.

**Masking Levels**: Three-tier privacy framework (Conservative, Light, Medium) that determines the scope of data obfuscation applied to recorded sessions.

**Session Replay ID**: Unique identifier linking recorded sessions to analytics events, enabling correlation between behavioral data and user actions.

**UGC Filter Rules**: URL sanitization patterns using glob syntax to remove personally identifiable information from captured URLs.

**Microscope Integration**: Connection to Amplitude's advanced analytics platform for deeper behavioral analysis and cohort segmentation.

**Shadow DOM Capture**: Advanced web recording capability that captures content within Shadow DOM boundaries for complete session reconstruction.

## Data Processing and Storage

Session Replay uses IndexedDB for browser storage with configurable `storeType` options. The system implements diff-based processing to minimize data volume, with compression algorithms and idle state optimization through `performanceConfig`. Data retention and transmission are managed through configurable flush intervals and quota management (HTTP 402/429 status handling).

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Session Replay operates as a core component within Amplitude's analytics ecosystem, integrating with:

**Amplitude Analytics**: Native plugin architecture provides seamless event correlation and user journey analysis when combined with traditional analytics tracking.

**Third-Party Analytics Platforms**: Standalone SDKs and wrapper plugins enable Session Replay deployment alongside Segment, Rudderstack, and other analytics providers while maintaining data correlation capabilities.

**Cookie Management Platforms**: Built-in CMP integration ensures compliance with privacy regulations through automated consent management and opt-out controls.

**Data Subject Rights APIs**: Integration with DSAR API and User Privacy API enables automated compliance with GDPR data access and deletion requests.

## Monitoring and Enterprise Features

The **Session Replay Ingestion Monitor** provides real-time tracking of ingestion health with HTTP status code monitoring (200, 429, 402) and invalid session ID detection. Enterprise capabilities include remote configuration precedence, organizational privacy settings management, behavioral cohort analysis, and EU data residency compliance through dedicated server zones.

Advanced performance features include WebWorker processing for browser optimization, CSS stylesheet inlining for accurate visual reconstruction, and configurable sampling rates for cost management and performance optimization.
