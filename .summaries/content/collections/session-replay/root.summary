Amplitude Session Replay is a comprehensive user behavior analytics platform that captures and reconstructs user interactions across web, mobile (iOS/Android), and React Native applications. The solution provides visual insights through session recordings, heatmaps, and behavioral analytics while maintaining enterprise-grade privacy controls and regulatory compliance capabilities.

## Product Architecture and Integration Ecosystem

Session Replay operates through a multi-platform SDK architecture designed for diverse technical environments:

**Web/Browser Implementation:**
- **Browser SDK Plugin** (`@amplitude/plugin-session-replay-browser`) integrates with Amplitude Browser SDK 2
- **Standalone SDK** (`@amplitude/session-replay-browser`) supports third-party analytics providers
- **Google Tag Manager Integration** enables client-side deployment through GTM Web Template

**Mobile Platform Support:**
- **iOS Plugin/Middleware** compatible with iOS Swift SDK and maintenance iOS SDK (8.21.0+)
- **Android Plugin/Middleware** supports Android-Kotlin SDK and maintenance Android SDK (2.40.1+)
- **React Native Plugin** (`@amplitude/plugin-session-replay-react-native`) provides native React Native implementation

**Third-Party Analytics Ecosystem:**
- **Segment Integration** supports Actions, Classic Device-mode, and Cloud-mode destinations
- **Rudderstack Integration** provides Cloud-mode wrapper with Anonymous ID mapping
- **Standalone SDKs** enable manual session management across iOS, Android, React Native, and Browser platforms

## Core Features and Technical Capabilities

**Session Recording Technology:**
Session Replay employs DOM capture and diff-based replay construction for web applications, while mobile platforms utilize view tree capture with diff-based reconstruction. The system provides real-time session reconstruction through compressed data transmission and IndexedDB storage with configurable retention periods.

**Heatmaps and Visual Analytics:**
The platform generates click maps, selector maps, and scroll maps for web applications, integrating behavioral cohorts with device identifier tracking. URL pattern matching with microscope functionality enables detailed analysis, requiring Browser SDK Plugin 1.7.0+ or Standalone SDK 1.14.0+.

**Privacy and Compliance Framework:**
Session Replay implements three masking levels (Conservative, Light, Medium) with CSS selector-based masking overrides supporting mask/unmask/exclude elements. UGC Filter Rules utilize glob patterns for URL sanitization, while GDPR compliance support includes configurable data retention and Consent Management Platform (CMP) integration.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Configuration Parameters:**
- `sampleRate`: Controls session recording percentage (0.0 to 1.0)
- `maskLevel`: Defines privacy masking intensity (Conservative/Light/Medium)
- `deviceId`/`sessionId`: User and session identification for replay correlation
- `serverZone`: Data residency control (US/EU)
- `optOut`: User privacy control mechanism

**SDK Methods and Properties:**
- `getSessionReplayProperties()`: Returns session replay metadata for event tagging
- `setSessionId()`/`setDeviceId()`: Manual ID management for standalone implementations
- `start()`/`stop()`: Session recording control methods
- `flush()`: Explicit data transmission trigger
- `[Amplitude] Session Replay ID`: Event property for session correlation

**Privacy Control Elements:**
- `AmpMaskView`: React Native component for sensitive data masking
- `.amp-block`: CSS class for element exclusion
- `amp-mask`/`amp-unmask`: Granular masking directives
- `privacyConfig`: Comprehensive privacy configuration object

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Session Replay integrates seamlessly within the Amplitude analytics ecosystem, automatically injecting Session Replay ID properties into analytics events and generating Session Start/Session End events. The middleware architecture enables integration with existing SDK implementations, while Source Middleware supports Segment cloud-mode implementations.

**Remote Configuration System:**
The platform supports dynamic privacy settings updates without code deployment through organizational-level configuration management. SDK vs UI conflict resolution prioritizes remote configuration, controlled via the `enableRemoteConfig` parameter.

**Monitoring and Debugging Infrastructure:**
The Ingestion Monitor provides real-time tracking of session replay ingestion status, monitoring HTTP status codes (200, 429, 402) and detecting invalid session IDs. The Users & Sessions tab facilitates implementation troubleshooting and validation.

## API Endpoints and Technical Integration Points

**Configuration Endpoints:**
- `configServerUrl`: Remote configuration endpoint
- `trackServerUrl`: Event tracking endpoint
- EU data residency support through `serverZone.EU`

**Performance and Storage Optimization:**
- IndexedDB storage with `storeType` configuration
- WebWorker compression via `experimental.useWebWorker`
- `requestIdleCallback` performance optimization
- Shadow DOM support for complex web applications

The Session Replay platform provides comprehensive user behavior analytics capabilities while maintaining flexible integration options across major platforms and analytics providers, supported by robust privacy controls and enterprise-grade compliance features.
