# Amplitude Experiment Product Overview

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude Experiment is an experimentation platform for creating, managing, and analyzing A/B tests and feature flags. It enables product teams to make data-driven decisions by testing hypotheses and measuring the impact of changes on user behavior. The platform integrates with the broader Amplitude analytics ecosystem for comprehensive experiment analysis.

## Product Relationships and Features

Amplitude Experiment follows a structured experimentation workflow:

1. **Experiment Configuration**: Users set up experiments with variants, distribution weights, and targeting rules.
2. **Variant Assignment**: Users are allocated to experiment variants using a bucketing mechanism with a unique bucketing salt.
3. **Exposure Tracking**: When users encounter the experiment, exposure events are recorded.
4. **Analysis**: The platform analyzes the relationship between assignments and exposures to ensure valid results.

The platform supports both client-side and server-side implementations through dedicated SDKs that handle variant assignment and exposure tracking. Experiments can be configured as "runs" that can be restarted to exclude previous user data.

Key features include:
- Sticky bucketing to ensure consistent user experiences
- Diagnostic charts for implementation validation
- Fallback variant handling for error cases
- Targeting and inclusion lists for precise user selection

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Experiment Runs**: Configurable test iterations that can be restarted to exclude previous data
- **Variant Assignment**: The process of allocating users to different experiment variants
- **Exposure Events**: Events tracking when users are shown a specific variant
- **Assignment Events**: Events recording when users are assigned to a variant
- **Bucketing Salt**: A unique identifier used to randomize user assignments
- **Experiment Key**: Identifier for a specific experiment run
- **Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM)**: Statistical anomaly where observed distribution differs from configured allocation
- **Variant Jumping**: When users see multiple variants of the same experiment
- **Assignment-to-Exposure Conversion**: Rate at which assigned users experience a variant
- **Inclusion List**: Predefined users who should receive a specific variant
- **Targeting**: Rules determining experiment eligibility

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Experiment integrates with the broader Amplitude analytics platform to provide:

1. User behavior analysis based on experiment variants
2. Cohort creation from experiment participants
3. Diagnostic tools leveraging Amplitude's analytics capabilities
4. Timeline analysis to track user interactions with experiments

This integration allows teams to connect experimental results with broader user behavior patterns and business metrics tracked in Amplitude.

## Troubleshooting Features

The platform includes several diagnostic tools:

1. **Exposures without Assignments Chart**: Identifies users who received experiment exposures without proper assignment events, potentially indicating:
   - Identity mismatches between assignment and exposure
   - Account switching issues
   - Improper tracking of fallback variants

2. **Sample Ratio Mismatch Detection**: Identifies statistically significant deviations from expected variant distributions, which may be caused by:
   - Changes to variant distribution weights
   - Instrumentation issues
   - Analysis window misalignment
   - Traffic allocation changes

3. **Variant Jumping Diagnostics**: Helps identify and resolve issues where users see multiple variants, distinguishing between normal causes (targeting changes, anonymous identity merging) and abnormal causes (identity mismatches).

4. **User Timeline Analysis**: Provides detailed debugging of individual user experiences within experiments.

Implementation best practices include proper configuration of experiment keys, consistent identity management, careful targeting rule management, and regular monitoring of diagnostic charts to ensure experiment integrity.
