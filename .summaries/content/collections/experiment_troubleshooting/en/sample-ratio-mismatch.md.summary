**Summary:** This troubleshooting guide addresses sample ratio mismatch (SRM) in Amplitude Experiment when observed variant allocation differs significantly from specified allocation, covering debugging steps from variant distribution weight changes and exposure/analysis window misalignment to variant jumping, sticky bucketing issues, and incorrect fallback variant exposure tracking.
