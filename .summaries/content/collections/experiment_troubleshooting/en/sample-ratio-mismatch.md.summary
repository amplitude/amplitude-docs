# Summary
This documentation page explains Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM) in Amplitude Experiment, which occurs when observed variant allocations significantly differ from specified allocations, indicating potential biases in experiment data. It provides a comprehensive troubleshooting guide covering common causes like variant distribution changes mid-experiment, exposure timing issues, variant jumping, and instrumentation problems.
