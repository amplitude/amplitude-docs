## Summary
This documentation page explains Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM) in Amplitude Experiment, which occurs when observed variant allocations differ significantly from specified allocations, indicating potential biases in experiment data. The page provides a comprehensive troubleshooting guide covering common causes of SRMs, from variant distribution weight changes to instrumentation issues, ordered by frequency of occurrence.
