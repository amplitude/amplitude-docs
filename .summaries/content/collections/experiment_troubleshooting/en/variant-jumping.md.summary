## Summary
This documentation explains variant jumping in Amplitude Experiment, where users are exposed to multiple variants for a single flag or experiment, covering debugging techniques using user timelines and Assignment events, normal causes (targeting changes, anonymous identity merging, inclusion lists), and abnormal causes (identity mismatches between assignment and exposure tracking).
