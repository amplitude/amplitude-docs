# Amplitude User Sessions: Comprehensive Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude's User Sessions is a powerful analytics feature that enables businesses to track and analyze user engagement patterns through session-based metrics. The feature allows users to measure critical engagement indicators such as session frequency, duration, and event distribution within sessions. User Sessions provides specialized visualization tools and metrics to help product teams, marketers, and analysts understand how users interact with their applications over time.

## Key Features and Concepts

1. **Session Tracking Methods**:
   - Server-side session tracking
   - Mobile client-side tracking (with 5-minute timeout)
   - Web client-side tracking (with 30-minute timeout)

2. **Core Session Metrics**:
   - Total sessions
   - Average session length
   - Sessions per user
   - Time spent per user
   - Event counts within sessions
   - Session length distribution

3. **Analysis Capabilities**:
   - Session duration filters
   - Length distribution histogram
   - Custom metric formulas for sessions
   - Breakdown tables for segmentation
   - Sequential filtering (property filters applied before session filters)

4. **Marketing-Specific Metrics**:
   - Bounce rate calculation
   - Page views per session
   - Entry/exit rates
   - Performance marketing metrics (CAC, ROAS)
   - Ad network metrics

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The User Sessions feature is integrated within Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem, specifically relating to:

1. **Event Segmentation**: User Sessions works alongside Event Segmentation charts to create comprehensive marketing metrics and analyze user behavior patterns.

2. **Sessions Module**: A dedicated component for analyzing session-based metrics and visualizing engagement patterns.

3. **Custom Formula Metrics**: Enables the creation of complex derived metrics based on session data.

4. **Group Segmentation**: Allows session analysis at both user and group levels.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Session**: A period of continuous user activity, defined differently based on platform:
   - Mobile: Continuous activity with less than 5-minute gaps
   - Web: Continuous activity with less than 30-minute gaps

2. **Session ID**: Unique identifier assigned to each user session for tracking purposes.

3. **Bounce Rate**: Percentage of sessions where users leave after viewing only one page.

4. **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**: Cost spent to acquire a new customer, calculated using session data and marketing spend.

5. **Return on Ad Spending (ROAS)**: Metric measuring revenue generated per dollar spent on advertising.

6. **Entry/Exit Rates**: Metrics showing which pages users most commonly enter or exit the application from.

7. **Session Length Distribution**: Histogram showing the distribution of session durations across user base.

## Use Cases

1. **Marketing Performance Analysis**:
   - Track bounce rates to optimize landing pages
   - Calculate customer acquisition costs across channels
   - Measure return on ad spending
   - Analyze entry and exit points

2. **User Engagement Analysis**:
   - Measure average session length across user segments
   - Track sessions per user to identify power users
   - Analyze event distribution within sessions
   - Monitor time spent per user

3. **Product Optimization**:
   - Identify pages with high exit rates
   - Analyze session patterns before conversion events
   - Compare session metrics across different user segments
   - Track changes in engagement metrics after product updates

## Implementation and Usage

The User Sessions charts can be accessed through the Amplitude interface and configured with various metrics and segmentation options. Users can apply filters at both the property level and session level, with property filters being applied before session filters in the sequential filtering process.

For marketing metrics specifically, users can follow detailed recipes provided in the documentation to create common metrics like bounce rate, page views per session, and performance marketing metrics using Event Segmentation and User Sessions charts.
