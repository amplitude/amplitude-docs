# Amplitude User Sessions: Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude User Sessions is a powerful analytics feature that enables businesses to track, measure, and analyze user engagement through session-based metrics. The product allows organizations to understand how users interact with their applications by providing detailed insights into session frequency, duration, and engagement patterns. User Sessions charts serve as a key tool for measuring user behavior, marketing effectiveness, and overall application performance.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Session Tracking Methods
- **Server-side sessions**: Tracked through backend systems
- **Mobile client-side sessions**: Tracked through mobile SDKs
- **Web client-side sessions**: Tracked through web SDKs
- **Session ID**: Unique identifier used to group events into sessions

### Measurement Capabilities
- **Total sessions**: Count of all user sessions
- **Time spent**: Total duration of user engagement
- **Average session length**: Mean duration of sessions
- **Session length distribution**: Breakdown of session durations
- **Events per session**: Count of specific events occurring within sessions
- **Sessions per user**: Frequency of user engagement

### Analysis Tools
- **User Sessions charts**: Primary visualization tool for session metrics
- **Breakdown tables**: Detailed view of session metrics by segments
- **Custom formula metrics**: Advanced calculations combining different metrics
- **Filtering capabilities**: Refine analysis by applying property and session filters

## Marketing Metrics Integration

User Sessions charts enable the creation of critical marketing metrics including:

- **Bounce rate**: Percentage of single-page sessions
- **Page views per session**: Average number of pages viewed during sessions
- **Entry/exit rates**: Analysis of first and last pages in sessions
- **Performance marketing metrics**: 
  - Ad network clicks
  - Customer acquisition cost (CAC)
  - Return on ad spending (ROAS)

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Session**: A group of user events that occur within a defined timeframe
- **Bounce**: A session containing only a single page view
- **Bounce rate**: Percentage of sessions with only one page view
- **Entry page**: First page viewed in a session
- **Exit page**: Last page viewed in a session
- **CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)**: Total cost to acquire a customer
- **ROAS (Return on Ad Spending)**: Revenue generated per dollar spent on advertising
- **Session length**: Duration from first to last event in a session
- **Session filters**: Criteria that determine which sessions are included in analysis

## Product Ecosystem Integration

User Sessions integrates with other Amplitude features to provide comprehensive analytics:

- **Event Segmentation**: Works alongside User Sessions to create detailed marketing metrics
- **Custom formulas**: Combines metrics from User Sessions with other data points
- **Segmentation capabilities**: Allows comparison of session metrics across different user groups

## Technical Implementation

### Chart Creation
To create User Sessions charts:
1. Navigate to the Analysis section in Amplitude
2. Select "User Sessions" as the chart type
3. Choose desired metrics (sessions, time spent, etc.)
4. Apply relevant filters and segmentation

### Filtering Behavior
- Property filters are applied before session filters
- Session filters determine which sessions are included in the analysis
- Event property filters can be used to focus on specific user actions

### Recipe Examples
For bounce rate calculation:
```
Bounce Rate = [Sessions with exactly 1 page view] / [Total sessions]
```

For customer acquisition cost:
```
CAC = [Total marketing spend] / [Number of new users]
```

User Sessions provides a robust framework for understanding user engagement patterns, optimizing marketing efforts, and improving overall product performance through detailed session-based analytics.
