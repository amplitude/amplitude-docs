# Amplitude User Sessions: Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude User Sessions is a powerful analytics feature that enables businesses to track, analyze, and understand user engagement patterns through session-based metrics. The product allows for comprehensive analysis of how users interact with applications or websites over time, providing insights into session frequency, duration, event counts, and other engagement metrics.

Key features include:
- Session tracking across multiple platforms (server-side, mobile client-side, web client-side)
- Detailed session metrics analysis through specialized charts
- Customizable filtering and segmentation options
- Marketing metrics capabilities for performance evaluation
- Integration with the broader Amplitude analytics ecosystem

Primary use cases include analyzing user engagement patterns, evaluating marketing campaign effectiveness, understanding user behavior flows, and optimizing conversion funnels.

## Product Relationships and Features

The User Sessions functionality in Amplitude consists of several interconnected components:

1. **User Sessions Chart**: The core visualization tool that displays session-based metrics and allows for detailed analysis of user engagement patterns.

2. **Event Segmentation**: Works alongside User Sessions to provide deeper insights into specific events occurring within sessions.

3. **Sessions Module**: Provides specialized functionality for analyzing session-based metrics including frequency, duration, and event counts.

4. **Marketing Metrics Recipes**: Pre-configured analysis templates specifically designed for marketing use cases, leveraging both User Sessions and Event Segmentation charts.

5. **Custom Formula Metrics**: Allows users to create tailored metrics by combining different session measurements to address specific business questions.

The User Sessions feature integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics capabilities, enabling users to move between session-level analysis and other types of user behavior analysis within the platform.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Session**: A period of user activity with a defined start and end, tracked differently depending on the platform:
  - **Server-side sessions**: Defined by developers using Amplitude's HTTP API
  - **Mobile client-side sessions**: Tracked automatically with configurable timeout periods
  - **Web client-side sessions**: Tracked automatically with configurable timeout periods

- **Session ID**: A unique identifier assigned to each user session

- **Session Metrics**:
  - **Total Sessions**: Count of all sessions meeting filter criteria
  - **Average Sessions per User**: Mean number of sessions per unique user
  - **Time Spent**: Total time users spent in sessions
  - **Average Session Length**: Mean duration of sessions
  - **Session Length Distribution**: Breakdown of sessions by duration categories

- **Bounce Rate**: Percentage of sessions where users exit after viewing only one page

- **Entry/Exit Rates**: Metrics showing which pages users commonly enter or leave from

- **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**: Marketing spend divided by number of new users

- **Return on Ad Spending (ROAS)**: Revenue generated divided by ad spend

- **Breakdown Table**: Detailed view showing session metrics segmented by user properties

## Product Ecosystem Integration

User Sessions is a specialized analysis module within the broader Amplitude analytics platform. It works in conjunction with:

1. **Event Segmentation**: User Sessions can be combined with Event Segmentation to create comprehensive marketing metrics and analyze specific user behaviors within sessions.

2. **Amplitude's Tracking Infrastructure**: The product relies on Amplitude's underlying tracking capabilities across server-side, mobile, and web platforms.

3. **Amplitude's Filtering System**: User Sessions implements a sequential filtering process where property filters are applied before session filters, allowing for precise cohort analysis.

4. **Group Segmentation**: User Sessions supports analysis at both the user level and group level (e.g., account, organization).

## Technical Implementation Details

The documentation doesn't explicitly mention API endpoints or command line invocations, but it does reference several technical implementation aspects:

- Session tracking implementation varies by platform:
  - Server-side: Uses Amplitude's HTTP API with developer-defined session IDs
  - Mobile client-side: Automatic tracking with configurable timeout periods
  - Web client-side: Automatic tracking with configurable timeout periods

- Custom formula metrics can be created using the platform's formula builder to combine different session measurements

- The product supports various filtering mechanisms including property filters and session filters, which are applied sequentially in analysis

- Marketing metrics recipes utilize both Event Segmentation and User Sessions charts with specific configurations to calculate metrics like bounce rate, page views per session, and customer acquisition cost
