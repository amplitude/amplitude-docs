- Client-side SDKs with automatic session timeout detection
- Event tracking systems that capture Page View events and custom marketing events

**Analysis Framework:**
- Custom formula creation for complex marketing calculations
- Property-based segmentation using First Property Value and Last Property Value functions
- Integration with broader Amplitude chart types for comprehensive analysis workflows

**Measurement Capabilities:**
