## Amplitude User Sessions Analytics

Amplitude's User Sessions feature provides comprehensive session-based analytics capabilities within the Amplitude Analytics platform. This module enables organizations to analyze user behavior patterns, engagement metrics, and marketing performance through a session-centric lens rather than individual event tracking.

## Product Relationships and Features

The User Sessions functionality operates as a specialized module within Amplitude Analytics, distinct from the standard Events Module. It integrates with several core Amplitude components:

- **Sessions Module** - Core engine replacing the standard Events Module for session analysis

**Data Visualization Components:**
- Interactive chart visualization with property-based segmentation (Country, Carrier, etc.)
- Breakdown tables with CSV export functionality for detailed analysis
- Distribution buckets for session length and frequency analysis

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions
