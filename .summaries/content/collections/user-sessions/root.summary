# Amplitude User Sessions Analytics

Amplitude User Sessions is a specialized analytics module within the Amplitude Analytics platform that provides comprehensive session-based behavioral analysis capabilities. This feature enables organizations to analyze user engagement patterns, marketing performance, and behavioral metrics through a session-centric approach rather than traditional individual event tracking.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

User Sessions operates as a distinct module within Amplitude Analytics, functioning alongside but separate from the standard Events Module. The architecture consists of several interconnected components:

**Core Analytics Engine:**
- **Sessions Module** - Primary analytical engine that replaces the Events Module for session-based analysis
- **User Sessions Charts** - Dedicated visualization component for session metrics
- **Event Segmentation Charts** - Complementary tool used for creating marketing performance metrics

**Data Visualization Layer:**
- Interactive chart interfaces with property-based segmentation capabilities (Country, Carrier, device properties)
- Breakdown tables featuring CSV export functionality for granular data analysis
- Distribution bucket analysis for session length and frequency patterns
- Real-time chart updates with configurable measurement parameters

**Integration Points:**
- Seamless integration with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem
- Marketing analytics pipeline for performance metrics
- Event filtering and segmentation systems
- Custom formula engine for advanced calculations

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Session Tracking Methodologies:**
- **Server-side Sessions** - Implemented through HTTP API v2 using explicit session_id field assignment
- **Client-side Mobile Sessions** - Automatic session boundary detection with 5-minute inactivity timeout threshold
- **Client-side Web Sessions** - Automatic session boundary detection with 30-minute inactivity timeout threshold
- **Out-of-session Events** - Events occurring outside defined session boundaries, assigned session ID -1

**Core Session Metrics:**
- **Session Duration/Length** - Total time span of continuous user activity within a session
- **Events per Session** - Aggregate count of events performed within individual session boundaries
- **Sessions per User** - Frequency measurement of session initiation by individual users
- **Bounce Rate** - Percentage calculation of sessions containing only a single event
- **Entry/Exit Rates** - Analysis of session initiation and termination behavioral patterns

**Advanced Formula Functions:**
- **SESSIONTOTALS** - Aggregates and summarizes session-level data across user cohorts
- **EVENTTOTALS** - Calculates comprehensive event counts within session boundaries
- **PROPSUM** - Performs summation of property values across session datasets
- **HIST** - Generates distribution histograms for session metrics
- **UNIQUES** - Counts unique values within session property sets
- **First/Last Property Value** - Captures property states at session boundary points

**Marketing Performance Metrics:**
- **ROAS (Return on Ad Spending)** - Revenue attribution per advertising dollar spent
- **CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)** - Cost calculation for acquiring new customers
- **CTR (Click-Through Rate)** - Engagement rate measurement for advertising campaigns
