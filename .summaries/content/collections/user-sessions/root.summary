# Amplitude User Sessions: Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude User Sessions is a specialized analytics feature that enables businesses to track, analyze, and optimize user engagement patterns through session-based metrics. The feature provides comprehensive visibility into how users interact with applications across web and mobile platforms, focusing on session duration, frequency, and quality metrics rather than just individual events.

Key features include:
- Session tracking across different platforms (server-side, mobile client-side, web client-side)
- Detailed session metrics (total sessions, session length, time spent)
- Marketing performance analysis capabilities
- Custom formula metrics for advanced analysis
- Breakdown tables for segmentation analysis
- Sequential filtering for refined data analysis

Primary use cases include:
- Analyzing user engagement patterns
- Measuring marketing campaign effectiveness
- Identifying bounce rates and exit points
- Optimizing session quality and duration
- Calculating customer acquisition costs and ROI

## Product Relationships and Features

The User Sessions feature in Amplitude consists of several interconnected components:

1. **User Sessions Chart**: The core visualization tool that displays session-based metrics rather than event-based metrics. It uses a dedicated Sessions Module instead of the Events Module.

2. **Measurement Options**:
   - Total Sessions
   - Time Spent
   - Length Distribution
   - Custom formulas

3. **Marketing Metrics Recipes**: Pre-configured analysis templates for common marketing use cases, including:
   - Session totals and bounce rates
   - Page views per session
   - Entry and exit rates
   - Performance marketing metrics (CAC, ROAS)

4. **Filtering Capabilities**:
   - Property filters (applied first)
   - Session filters (applied after property filters)
   - Group segmentation options

5. **Breakdown Tables**: Allow for detailed segmentation analysis of session data across different user groups or properties.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Session**: A period of user activity with defined start and end boundaries. Sessions are tracked differently based on platform:
  - Mobile client-side: Default 5-minute timeout
  - Web client-side: Default 30-minute timeout
  - Server-side: Custom implementation

- **Session ID**: Unique identifier assigned to each user session for tracking purposes.

- **Bounce Rate**: Percentage of sessions where users leave after viewing only one page or taking minimal action.

- **Entry/Exit Rates**: Metrics showing which pages users most commonly enter or exit the application from.

- **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**: The cost to acquire a new customer, calculated using session and conversion data.

- **Return on Ad Spending (ROAS)**: Metric showing revenue generated per dollar spent on advertising.

- **Sessions Module**: The analytical engine that processes session data, distinct from the Events Module.

- **Sequential Filtering**: The process where property filters are applied before session filters in the analysis pipeline.

## Integration with Amplitude Ecosystem

User Sessions integrates with the broader Amplitude analytics ecosystem in several ways:

1. It leverages the core Amplitude data collection infrastructure but processes the data through a specialized Sessions Module.

2. It complements Event Segmentation charts by providing session-level insights rather than event-level analysis.

3. The feature supports Group segmentation, aligning with Amplitude's account-based analytics capabilities.

4. Custom formula metrics allow integration with other Amplitude metrics and dimensions for comprehensive analysis.

5. Marketing metrics recipes integrate with performance marketing data to provide ROI and effectiveness measurements.

## Technical Implementation

The implementation of User Sessions varies by platform:

- **Mobile Client-Side Implementation**: Uses a 5-minute timeout by default to determine session boundaries.

- **Web Client-Side Implementation**: Uses a 30-minute timeout by default to determine session boundaries.

- **Server-Side Implementation**: Requires custom session tracking logic implemented by the development team.

The documentation suggests that session data can be accessed and analyzed through Amplitude's standard chart interfaces, with special options available for session-specific metrics and filtering.
