## Amplitude User Sessions

Amplitude User Sessions is a specialized analytics module within Amplitude Analytics that provides session-based analysis capabilities for tracking user engagement patterns, marketing performance, and behavioral metrics. The User Sessions feature operates as an alternative to the standard Events Module, focusing specifically on analyzing user interactions grouped by session rather than individual events.

## Core Features and Capabilities

The User Sessions module enables analysis of session duration, frequency, event counts within sessions, and session-based segmentation. Key analytical capabilities include measuring total sessions, time spent per user, average session length, length distribution analysis, and average events per session. The system supports both session-level and event-level metrics through specialized formulas and can generate distribution buckets for detailed session analysis.

## Product Relationships and Integration

User Sessions charts work in conjunction with Event Segmentation charts to provide comprehensive marketing analytics. The module integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem through shared segmentation capabilities, property filtering, and data export functionality. Session data can be analyzed alongside standard event data, with the ability to filter sessions by contained events and apply property-based segmentation using dimensions like Country and Carrier.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Session Tracking Methods:**
- Server-side tracking via HTTP API v2 using session_id field
- Client-side mobile tracking with 5-minute session timeout
- Client-side web tracking with 30-minute session timeout
- Out-of-session events marked with flag -1
- Session timestamps tracked in milliseconds since epoch

**Chart Components:**
- Sessions Module: Core analytical engine for session-based metrics
- Count dropdown: Selection mechanism for different measurement types
- Breakdown table: Detailed view of session and event data with segmentation
- Measured As Module: Configuration for output metric types
- Segment By module: Property-based session categorization

**Specialized Formulas:**
- SESSIONTOTALS: Aggregates session-level data
- EVENTTOTALS: Counts events across sessions
- PROPSUM: Sums property values within sessions
- HIST: Creates distribution analysis
- UNIQUES: Counts unique values in sessions

## Ecosystem Integration

User Sessions operates within Amplitude's comprehensive analytics platform, sharing data infrastructure with Event Segmentation charts and supporting export to CSV for external analysis. The module connects to marketing attribution systems through performance marketing metrics, enabling calculation of ROAS (Return on Ad Spending), CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost), and CTR (Click-Through Rate) using custom formulas that combine session data with ad network metrics.

## API and Implementation Details

Session tracking utilizes multiple implementation approaches:
- HTTP API v2 endpoint with session_id parameter for server-side implementation
- Client-side SDKs with automatic session timeout management
- Custom session property configuration for specialized tracking requirements
- Integration with Page View events for web analytics and Complete Purchase events for conversion tracking

The system processes various event types including Page View events with URL filtering, Daily ad metric events for performance tracking, User Sign Up events for acquisition analysis, and Add to Cart events for e-commerce session analysis. Property filtering occurs before session filtering in the processing pipeline, and the breakdown table provides detailed segmentation capabilities with First Property Value and Last Property Value analysis options.
