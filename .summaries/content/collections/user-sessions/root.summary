User Sessions integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics capabilities, enabling seamless transitions between session-level analysis and other types of user behavior analysis.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Session**: A period of user activity with defined start and end points:
  - **Server-side sessions**: Defined by developers using Amplitude's HTTP API
  - **Mobile client-side sessions**: Automatically tracked with configurable timeout periods
  - **Web client-side sessions**: Automatically tracked with configurable timeout periods

- **Session ID**: Unique identifier assigned to each user session

- **Session Metrics**:
  - **Total Sessions**: Count of all sessions meeting filter criteria
  - **Average Sessions per User**: Mean number of sessions per unique user
  - **Time Spent**: Total time users spent in sessions
  - **Average Session Length**: Mean duration of sessions
  - **Session Length Distribution**: Breakdown of sessions by duration categories

- **Bounce Rate**: Percentage of sessions where users exit after viewing only one page

- **Entry/Exit Rates**: Metrics showing which pages users commonly enter or leave from

- **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**: Marketing spend divided by number of new users

- **Return on Ad Spending (ROAS)**: Revenue generated divided by ad spend

## Product Ecosystem Integration

User Sessions is a specialized analysis module within the Amplitude analytics platform that works in conjunction with:

1. **Event Segmentation**: Can be combined to create comprehensive marketing metrics and analyze specific user behaviors within sessions.

2. **Amplitude's Tracking Infrastructure**: Relies on Amplitude's underlying tracking capabilities across server-side, mobile, and web platforms.

## Technical Implementation Details

Session tracking implementation varies by platform:
- Server-side: Uses Amplitude's HTTP API with developer-defined session IDs
- Mobile client-side: Automatic tracking with configurable timeout periods
- Web client-side: Automatic tracking with configurable timeout periods

The product supports various filtering mechanisms including property filters and session filters, which are applied sequentially in analysis. Marketing metrics recipes utilize both Event Segmentation and User Sessions charts with specific configurations to calculate metrics like bounce rate, page views per session, and customer acquisition cost.
