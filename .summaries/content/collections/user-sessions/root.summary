# Amplitude User Sessions: Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude User Sessions is an analytics feature that tracks, measures, and analyzes user engagement through session-based metrics. It provides organizations with detailed insights into how users interact with their applications by capturing session frequency, duration, and engagement patterns. User Sessions charts function as essential tools for measuring user behavior, evaluating marketing effectiveness, and assessing application performance.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Session Tracking Methods
- **Server-side sessions**: Tracked through backend systems
- **Mobile client-side sessions**: Tracked via mobile SDKs
- **Web client-side sessions**: Tracked via web SDKs
- **Session ID**: Unique identifier that groups events into sessions

### Measurement Capabilities
- **Total sessions**: Quantifies all user sessions
- **Time spent**: Measures total user engagement duration
- **Average session length**: Calculates mean session duration
- **Session length distribution**: Provides breakdown of session durations
- **Events per session**: Counts specific events within sessions
- **Sessions per user**: Measures frequency of user engagement

### Analysis Tools
- **User Sessions charts**: Primary visualization for session metrics
- **Breakdown tables**: Detailed segmentation of session metrics
- **Custom formula metrics**: Advanced calculations combining different metrics
- **Filtering capabilities**: Refines analysis through property and session filters

## Marketing Metrics Integration

User Sessions charts enable critical marketing metrics including:

- **Bounce rate**: Percentage of single-page sessions
- **Page views per session**: Average pages viewed per session
- **Entry/exit rates**: Analysis of first and last pages in sessions
- **Performance marketing metrics**:
  - Ad network clicks
  - Customer acquisition cost (CAC)
  - Return on ad spending (ROAS)

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Session**: Group of user events occurring within a defined timeframe
- **Bounce**: Session containing only a single page view
- **Bounce rate**: Percentage of single-page-view sessions
- **Entry page**: First page viewed in a session
- **Exit page**: Last page viewed in a session
- **CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)**: Total cost to acquire a customer
- **ROAS (Return on Ad Spending)**: Revenue generated per dollar of ad spend
- **Session length**: Duration from first to last event in a session
- **Session filters**: Criteria determining which sessions are included in analysis

## Product Ecosystem Integration

User Sessions integrates with other Amplitude features to provide comprehensive analytics:

- **Event Segmentation**: Complements User Sessions for detailed marketing metrics
- **Custom formulas**: Combines User Sessions metrics with other data points
- **Segmentation capabilities**: Enables comparison of session metrics across user groups

## Technical Implementation

### Chart Creation
To create User Sessions charts:
1. Navigate to the Analysis section in Amplitude
2. Select "User Sessions" as the chart type
3. Choose desired metrics (sessions, time spent, etc.)
4. Apply relevant filters and segmentation

### Filtering Behavior
- Property filters are applied before session filters
- Session filters determine which sessions are included in analysis
- Event property filters can focus on specific user actions

### Recipe Examples
For bounce rate calculation:
```
Bounce Rate = [Sessions with exactly 1 page view] / [Total sessions]
```

For customer acquisition cost:
```
CAC = [Total marketing spend] / [Number of new users]
```
