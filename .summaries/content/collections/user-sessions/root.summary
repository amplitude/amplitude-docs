# Amplitude User Sessions: Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude User Sessions is an analytics feature that helps businesses track, analyze, and optimize user engagement patterns through session-based metrics. It enables organizations to understand how users interact with their applications by measuring session frequency, duration, and engagement levels across different user segments. The product provides comprehensive visualization and analysis capabilities for session data, supporting both standard metrics and custom formulas for specialized use cases.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Session Tracking Methods
- **Server-side sessions**: Tracked through backend implementations
- **Mobile client-side sessions**: Native SDK implementations for mobile applications
- **Web client-side sessions**: Browser-based tracking for websites

### Core Metrics and Analysis Capabilities
- **Total sessions**: Count of all user sessions
- **Time spent**: Total duration of sessions
- **Average session length**: Mean duration of sessions
- **Session length distribution**: Histogram visualization of session durations
- **Events per session**: Count of specific events occurring within sessions
- **Sessions per user**: Frequency of user engagement
- **Entry/exit rates**: Analysis of first and last pages in sessions
- **Bounce rate**: Percentage of single-page sessions

### Advanced Features
- **Custom formula metrics**: Create specialized calculations using session data
- **Breakdown tables**: Segment session data by user properties
- **Filtering capabilities**: Apply property filters before session grouping
- **Session properties**: Group and filter by session-specific attributes

## Product Relationships and Ecosystem Integration

User Sessions integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem:

1. **Event Segmentation**: User Sessions complements Event Segmentation charts:
   - Event Segmentation focuses on individual events
   - User Sessions focuses on groups of events within session boundaries

2. **Marketing Analytics**: User Sessions provides essential metrics for marketing performance analysis:
   - Performance marketing metrics (CAC, ROAS)
   - Ad network metrics integration
   - Conversion tracking across sessions

3. **Sessions Module**: A specialized component for in-depth session analysis, offering:
   - Session length histograms
   - Engagement frequency analysis
   - Custom metric formulas specific to sessions

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Session**: A group of user events occurring within a defined time boundary
- **Session ID**: Unique identifier assigned to each session
- **Bounce Rate**: Percentage of sessions with only a single page view
- **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**: Cost to acquire a new customer, calculated using session data
- **Return on Ad Spending (ROAS)**: Revenue generated relative to advertising costs
- **Entry Rate**: Percentage of sessions beginning with a specific page
- **Exit Rate**: Percentage of sessions ending with a specific page
- **Session Length**: Duration from first to last event in a session
- **Sessions Per User**: Average number of sessions initiated by each user

## Implementation and Usage

The User Sessions chart can be accessed and configured through the Amplitude interface. Key implementation considerations include:

1. **Session Configuration**:
   - Define session timeout parameters
   - Configure tracking methods (server-side vs. client-side)
   - Set up session property tracking

2. **Chart Creation**:
   - Select User Sessions chart type
   - Choose desired metrics (total sessions, average length, etc.)
   - Apply relevant filters and breakdowns
   - Group by user segments or properties

3. **Marketing Metrics Implementation**:
   - Use custom formulas for specialized marketing metrics
   - Integrate ad network data for performance analysis
   - Configure conversion tracking across sessions
