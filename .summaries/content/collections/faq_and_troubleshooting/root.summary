Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics platform that provides product teams with behavioral analytics, experimentation capabilities, and user engagement insights. The platform centers around event-based analytics, tracking user interactions across web and mobile applications to help organizations understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven decision making.

## Core Product Architecture and Features

Amplitude's analytics platform is built on an event-based architecture that captures user interactions as discrete events with associated properties. The system supports multiple data ingestion methods including JavaScript and mobile SDKs, HTTP V2 API for real-time streaming (with 30 events/second throttling limits), and Batch Event Upload API for bulk data processing and backfills. The platform maintains data immutability through pre-aggregated hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly datasets, ensuring consistent reporting while preventing historical data modification.

The platform offers several core chart types for analysis: Event Segmentation for measuring user actions and engagement metrics, Funnel Analysis for conversion tracking with unique users vs event totals counting methods, Retention Analysis using weighted average calculations with "Return On" vs "Return On or After" methodologies, User Composition for demographic analysis, and Data Tables for multi-dimensional breakdowns with CSV export capabilities limited to 10,000 rows per metric.

Amplitude Experiment provides A/B testing and feature flagging capabilities with sequential testing methodology, offering always-valid p-values and controlled Type 1 error rates. The experimentation platform includes mutual exclusion groups to prevent users from being assigned to multiple experiments simultaneously, with assignment order following individual user qualification → mutual exclusion → sticky bucketing → target segment logic.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Monthly Tracked Users (MTUs)** represent the primary billing metric, with various plan limits and overage fees at 1.2x rates. **Device IDs** are automatically generated identifiers that vary by platform (Android UUID, iOS IDFV/IDFA), while **User IDs** are custom identifiers for known users. **Amplitude IDs** serve as universal user identifiers that persist across device and user ID changes.

**Behavioral Cohorts** are dynamic user segments based on behavioral criteria, with static cohorts available through CSV uploads and Microscope analysis. **Session IDs** track user sessions with platform-specific timeout windows (30 minutes for web, 5 minutes for mobile), while **Event Properties** and **User Properties** capture contextual information with instrumentation limits of 2000 event types, 2000 event properties, and 1000 user properties per project.

**Sequential Testing** in Amplitude Experiment requires minimum thresholds of 25 conversions plus 100 exposures for unique metrics, or 100 exposures for totals, providing statistical significance calculations with controlled false positive rates. **Attribution Events** track marketing attribution through the Attribution API with a 72-hour mapping window for IDFA/IDFV/ADID identifiers.

## Data Management and Governance

Amplitude Data provides tracking plan governance with options to hide, block, or delete events and properties. Hidden events remain in data but disappear from chart dropdowns, blocked events prevent future ingestion while preserving historical data, and deleted events remove both historical data and future ingestion capabilities. The platform enforces a 2000 event type instrumentation limit per project, with monthly event volume limits varying by plan tier.

Data export capabilities include the Export API for JSON format raw data access, Amazon S3 Export integration for bulk data transfers, and chart-specific CSV exports with varying row limits (10,000 for Event Segmentation, 300 for Funnel Analysis). The platform maintains data immutability, requiring Export API + Batch API workflows for historical data cleaning, with self-service data deletion available for Growth and Enterprise plans.

## Integration Ecosystem and APIs

The platform integrates extensively with third-party tools through various APIs and connectors. The Behavioral Cohort API enables programmatic cohort management with props and propKeys parameters for user segmentation. Attribution integrations support major mobile attribution partners including Appsflyer, Adjust, Branch, and Singular through the Attribution API.

Segment integration provides cloud-mode and device-mode connection options, with specific troubleshooting for sessionId tracking and event property mapping. Third-party website builders like Wix and Squarespace are supported through platform-specific implementation methods including Wix's Tracking Tools & Analytics and Squarespace's Code Injection features.

## Authentication and Access Control

The platform supports both password-based authentication and Single Sign-On (SSO) with SAML certificate configuration and Google Workspace integration. Access issues commonly involve 500 internal server errors, 403 app_not_enabled_for_user errors, and SSO configuration problems. Channel classifier functionality for acquisition tracking requires Growth/Enterprise plans with org admin/manager permissions.

## Plan Structure and Billing

Amplitude offers multiple plan tiers including Free, Plus, Growth, and Enterprise plans with varying MTU limits and feature access. The Startup Scholarship plan provides qualifying startups (less than $10M funding, fewer than 20 employees) with one year of free Growth plan access including 200,000 MTUs. Plus plan subscribers face MTU guardrails with 1,000 events per MTU limits and automatic renewal policies managed through Plans & Billing settings.

## Compliance and Security

The platform maintains SOC2 Type 2, GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA compliance standards with comprehensive Data Processing Addendum (DPA) and Terms of Service documentation. Security features include Customer Trust Portal access, Bug Bounty programs, and User Privacy API for GDPR compliance and data deletion requests.
