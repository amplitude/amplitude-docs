# Amplitude Product Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics platform that helps organizations understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive business growth through data-driven insights. The platform enables teams to track, analyze, and act on user interactions across digital products.

## Key Features and Concepts

- **Event-Based Analytics**: Tracks user events and behaviors across digital platforms
- **User Identity Management**: Uses various identifiers to track users across sessions and devices
- **Behavioral Cohorts**: Creates user segments based on specific behaviors or properties
- **Experiment Analysis**: Provides A/B testing capabilities with statistical significance calculations
- **Data Visualization**: Offers various chart types for analyzing user behavior
- **Data Governance**: Controls for managing data visibility and collection
- **Integration Capabilities**: Connects with third-party platforms and supports data export options

## Product Relationships and Architecture

### Data Collection and Management

Amplitude collects data through multiple channels:
- Client-side SDKs (JavaScript, iOS, Android)
- Server-side APIs (HTTP V2 API, Batch Event Upload API)
- Third-party integrations (Segment)

The data processing pipeline collects events through SDKs or APIs, processes and stores them in pre-aggregated data sets, with historical data generally remaining immutable after ingestion.

Data governance tools allow organizations to:
- Hide events/properties (still collect but hide from UI)
- Block events/properties (stop collecting new data)
- Delete events/properties (completely remove from ingestion)

### Analytics and Visualization

Amplitude offers various chart types for data analysis:
- Event Segmentation: Analyzes event patterns and properties
- Funnel Analysis: Tracks user conversion through defined steps
- Retention Analysis: Measures user return rates over time
- User Composition: Analyzes user property distributions
- Personas: Clusters users based on behavioral patterns
- Data Tables: Provides tabular representation of analytics data

The Experiment Platform includes:
- A/B testing with statistical significance calculations
- Sequential testing methodology
- Mutual exclusion groups to prevent experiment interference
- Duration estimates for experiment planning

### User Management

User identification in Amplitude uses:
- Device ID: Default identifier (IDFV on iOS)
- User ID: Custom identifier for logged-in users
- Amplitude ID: System-generated identifier
- User profile merging to connect anonymous and identified activity

User segmentation features include:
- Behavioral Cohorts based on actions or properties
- Saved segments for reuse across analyses
- Dynamic vs. static cohort definitions

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Events**: User actions tracked in Amplitude (limited to 2000 event types per project)

2. **Properties**:
   - **Event Properties**: Attributes attached to events (limited to 2000 per project)
   - **User Properties**: Attributes attached to users (limited to 1000 per project)
   - **Group Properties**: Attributes for account/organization level analysis

3. **MTU (Monthly Tracked Users)**: Unique users tracked per month, a key billing metric

4. **Sessions**: Series of user events grouped by time proximity (default timeout: 30 minutes)

5. **Statistical Significance**: Confidence that observed differences aren't due to chance
   - Uses two-tailed T-test for Funnel Analysis
   - Uses sequential testing (mSPRT) for Experiment Results

6. **Channel Classifier**: Feature to define acquisition channels for traffic source tracking

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates with various components of the digital product stack:

1. **Data Sources**:
   - Direct SDK implementation
   - Segment integration
   - Server-side API implementations
   - Third-party site builders (Wix, Squarespace)

2. **Data Destinations**:
   - Export API for JSON-formatted data
   - Query Add-on (Amplitude SQL/Snowflake ETL)
   - Amazon S3 Export for event data

3. **Experiment Platform**: Integrates with core analytics for experiment analysis

4. **Compliance and Security**:
   - SOC2 Type 2, GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA compliance
   - Data Processing Addendum (DPA) available

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementations

1. **HTTP V2 API**:
   - For real-time, low-volume data (30 events/second limit)
   - Used for immediate event processing

2. **Batch Event Upload API**:
   - For high-volume data transfers
   - Used for backfills and migrations

3. **Cohort API**:
   - Export cohorts with specific user properties
   - Manage behavioral cohorts programmatically

4. **Export API**:
   - Export raw event data in JSON format

5. **Identify API**:
   - Update user properties without sending events
