Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics platform that provides product teams with behavioral analytics, experimentation capabilities, and user engagement insights. The platform centers around event-based data collection and analysis, enabling organizations to track user interactions, measure product performance, and optimize user experiences through data-driven decision making.

## Core Product Architecture and Features

Amplitude's analytics platform is built on an event-based architecture that captures user interactions as discrete events with associated properties. The system supports multiple data ingestion methods including SDKs for mobile (iOS, Android) and web platforms, server-side APIs (HTTP V2 API, Batch Event Upload API), and third-party integrations like Segment. The platform maintains immutable data storage with pre-aggregated hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly datasets to ensure consistent reporting and performance.

The product suite includes several key analytical chart types: Event Segmentation for measuring user actions and conversions, Funnel Analysis for tracking multi-step user journeys, Retention Analysis for measuring user return behavior, User Composition for analyzing user demographics and properties, Data Tables for multi-dimensional analysis, and Personas for behavioral clustering. Additionally, Amplitude Experiment provides A/B testing capabilities with statistical significance testing using both sequential testing and T-test methodologies.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**User Identification**: Amplitude uses multiple identifier types including User ID (custom identifier), Device ID (platform-specific like Android UUID or iOS IDFV/IDFA), and Amplitude ID (internal identifier). The platform supports user profile merging between anonymous and known users.

**Event Structure**: Events consist of event names, event properties (contextual data), and user properties (persistent user attributes). The platform enforces instrumentation limits of 2000 event types, 2000 event properties, and 1000 user properties per project.

**Session Management**: Sessions are tracked with configurable timeout windows (30 minutes for web, 5 minutes for mobile by default) and can be customized through SDK configuration parameters like `flushIntervalMillis`, `flushQueueSize`, `eventUploadPeriodSeconds`, and `eventUploadThreshold`.

**Data Governance**: Amplitude Data provides tracking plan management with options to hide, block, or delete events and properties. Hidden events remain in data but are removed from UI dropdowns, blocked events prevent future ingestion, and deleted events remove both ingestion and UI access.

## Statistical and Experimentation Features

Amplitude Experiment implements sophisticated statistical methodologies including sequential testing with always-valid p-values and traditional T-tests. The platform calculates statistical significance using 5% false positive rates with minimum sample size requirements (25 conversions + 100 exposures for unique metrics, 100 exposures for totals). Mutual exclusion groups prevent users from being assigned to multiple experiments simultaneously through slot allocation percentages and assignment order operations.

Duration estimates predict experiment completion using sequential testing parameters, means, variances, and exposure rates, with a 40-day estimation cap. The system supports both absolute and relative lift calculations for treatment vs control comparisons.

## Data Management and Export Capabilities

The platform provides multiple data export options including the Export API for JSON format exports, Amazon S3 Export integration for bulk data transfers, and CSV exports with varying limits (10,000 rows for Data Tables, 300 group-by limits for Funnel Analysis and Retention Analysis). The Behavioral Cohorts API enables programmatic cohort management with `propKeys` parameters for property inclusion.

Monthly event volume limits are enforced on a calendar month basis with overage fees at 1.2x rates for Plus plan users. The system includes MTU (Monthly Tracked Users) guardrails with 1,000 events per MTU limits to prevent abuse.

## Integration and Technical Implementation

Amplitude supports various integration patterns including direct SDK implementation, third-party website builders (Wix Tracking Tools & Analytics, Squarespace Code Injection), and webhook/HTTP API fallbacks. The platform addresses browser compatibility issues like Firefox tracking protection through proxy server configurations.

For mobile attribution, the Attribution API provides a 72-hour mapping window for IDFA/IDFV/ADID identifiers, requiring pre-existing users with matching advertising IDs. iOS 14 IDFA opt-in requirements affect device identification and attribution matching capabilities.

## API Endpoints and Technical Specifications

Key API endpoints include:
- **HTTP V2 API**: Real-time event ingestion with 30 events/second throttling limits
- **Batch Event Upload API**: Bulk data processing for backfills and high-volume scenarios
- **Export API**: Raw event data extraction in JSON format
- **Behavioral Cohorts API**: Cohort management and export functionality
- **Attribution API**: Mobile attribution event mapping
- **Identity API**: User profile management and merging

The platform implements EPUS (events per user per second) and EPDS (events per device per second) rate limiting to ensure system stability and fair resource allocation across customers.
