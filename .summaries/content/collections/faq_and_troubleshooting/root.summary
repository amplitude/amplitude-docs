# Amplitude Analytics Platform

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics platform that provides product teams with behavioral analytics, experimentation capabilities, and user engagement insights. The platform centers around event-based tracking to understand user journeys, measure product performance, and optimize user experiences through data-driven decision making.

## Core Product Architecture and Features

### Analytics and Visualization Engine
The platform's foundation is built on event-based analytics with multiple chart types for different analytical needs:

- **Event Segmentation**: Primary chart for analyzing event volumes, user counts, and behavioral patterns with custom formulas (ROLLWIN, PROP()), group-by filtering, and percentage calculations including DAU/MAU ratios
- **Funnel Analysis**: Conversion tracking with unique users vs event totals counting, 24-hour conversion windows, revenue attribution, and time-to-convert calculations with any-order or exact-order funnel configurations
- **Retention Analysis**: User return behavior analysis using weighted average calculations for "Return On" vs "Return On or After" retention types with custom bracket features
- **User Composition**: User property distribution analysis that requires active events to display Identify API updates
- **Data Tables**: Multi-dimensional analysis with group-by aggregation, supporting up to 10,000 baseline rows with attribution model pruning
- **User Sessions**: Session-based analytics requiring valid session IDs with configurable timeout behaviors
- **Personas**: Behavioral clustering using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithm for high-dimensional event data analysis

### Experimentation Platform (Amplitude Experiment)
Advanced A/B testing capabilities featuring:
- **Sequential Testing**: Statistical methodology with always-valid p-values, requiring 25 conversions + 100 exposures for uniques metrics
- **Mutual Exclusion Groups**: Prevents users from multiple simultaneous experiment assignments through slot allocation percentages
- **Duration Estimates**: Predicts experiment completion time with 40-day caps using means, variances, and exposure calculations
- **Statistical Significance**: Comparison between sequential testing and T-test methodologies with 5% false positive rates

### Data Management and Governance

#### Amplitude Data
Comprehensive data governance system with:
- **Tracking Plans**: Event and property schema management with instrumentation limits (2000 event types, 2000 event properties, 1000 user properties per project)
- **Data Filters**: IP address blocking, internal user filtering, and bot traffic prevention
- **Transformations**: Event merging, property merging with retroactive application and bulk chart updates via Find & Replace
- **Channel Classifier**: Acquisition channel definition using utm_medium and referring_domain properties

#### Behavioral Cohorts
Dynamic and static user segmentation with:
- **CSV Upload**: Cohort creation using Amplitude IDs vs user IDs
- **API Integration**: Behavioral Cohorts API for programmatic cohort management with propKeys parameter export
- **Retention Integration**: Cohort creation from retention charts and Microscope static cohorts

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### User Identity Management
- **Amplitude ID**: Platform-generated unique identifier for user tracking
- **Device ID**: SDK-generated identifier (Android UUID, iOS IDFV/IDFA) with iOS 14 IDFA opt-in requirements
- **User ID**: Customer-defined identifier for known users
- **Session ID**: Configurable session tracking with mobile SDK timeout behaviors (30-minute web, 5-minute mobile default)

### Data Ingestion and Processing
- **Monthly Event Volume (MEV)**: Billing metric with plan-specific limits and overage fees
- **Monthly Tracked Users (MTU)**: User-based billing metric with 1,000 events per MTU guardrails on Plus plan
- **HTTP V2 API**: Real-time ingestion with 30 events/second throttling limits
- **Batch Event Upload API**: Bulk processing for data backfills without real-time constraints
- **Attribution API**: 72-hour mapping window for IDFA/IDFV/ADID mobile attribution events

### Statistical and Analytical Concepts
- **Sequential Testing**: Always-valid statistical methodology preventing false positive inflation from result peeking
- **Improvement Over Baseline**: A/B testing metric calculation for conversion ratio comparisons
- **Weighted Average**: Retention calculation method accounting for user count variations across time periods
- **Event-Time vs Current Values**: Property value differences between historical event context and current user state

## Product Ecosystem Integration

### Third-Party Integrations
- **Segment Integration**: Cloud-mode vs device-mode connection types with sessionId tracking and API key configuration
- **Mobile Attribution Partners**: Appsflyer, Adjust, Branch, Singular integration via Attribution API
- **Website Builders**: Wix Tracking Tools & Analytics, Squarespace Code Injection support for JavaScript SDK implementation

### Data Export and External Connectivity
- **Export API**: JSON format raw event data extraction for external analysis
- **Query Add-on**: Snowflake SQL query capabilities for advanced data analysis
- **Amazon S3 Export**: Automated data pipeline integration for data warehousing
- **CSV Exports**: Chart-specific limits (300 for Funnel Analysis, 10,000 for Data Tables, 1 million for Microscope)

### SDK and Implementation
- **JavaScript SDK**: Browser-based tracking with proxy server configuration for Firefox tracking protection
- **Mobile SDKs**: Android Kotlin SDK (flushIntervalMillis/flushQueueSize) and iOS SDK (eventUploadPeriodSeconds/eventUploadThreshold) with configurable batching thresholds
- **Server-Side Integration**: HTTP API implementation for backend event tracking

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

### Core APIs
- **HTTP V2 API**: `/httpapi/v2/httpapi` - Real-time event ingestion with EPUS/EPDS throttling
- **Batch Event Upload API**: Bulk data processing endpoint for high-volume ingestion
- **Export API**: Raw event data extraction in JSON format
- **Behavioral Cohorts API**: Programmatic cohort management with propKeys parameter
- **Attribution API**: Mobile attribution event mapping with 72-hour window
- **Identity API**: User profile management and property updates
- **User Privacy API**: GDPR compliance and data deletion capabilities

### SDK Configuration Parameters
- **Android Kotlin SDK**: `flushIntervalMillis`, `flushQueueSize` for event batching control
- **iOS SDK**: `eventUploadPeriodSeconds`, `eventUploadThreshold` for upload frequency management
- **JavaScript SDK**: Proxy server configuration for tracking protection bypass

## Plan Structure and Limitations

### Subscription Tiers
- **Starter/Plus Plans**: Basic analytics with MTU-based billing and 1.2x overage rates
- **Growth Plan**: Advanced features including Behavioral Cohorts, Pathfinder, custom data retention
- **Enterprise Plan**: Full feature access with SSO, advanced security compliance
- **Startup Scholarship**: Qualifying startups receive one year free Growth plan access (200,000 MTUs, <$10M funding, <20 employees)

### Technical Constraints
- **Chart Limits**: Event Segmentation breakdown tables (100 property values), inline behavioral cohorts (3-year range)
- **String Limits**: 1024 character limit for property values
