## Amplitude Analytics Platform

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics platform that provides product teams with behavioral analytics, experimentation capabilities, and user journey insights. The platform centers around event-based tracking to understand user behavior across web and mobile applications, with robust features for cohort analysis, funnel optimization, and A/B testing.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem consists of several interconnected products and features:

**Core Analytics Engine**: Built on an event-based data model that tracks user interactions through events, event properties, and user properties. The platform uses immutable data architecture with pre-aggregated hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly datasets for fast query performance.

**Amplitude Analytics**: The primary analytics interface featuring multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Composition, User Sessions, Data Tables, and Personas clustering. Each chart type serves specific analytical use cases while sharing common segmentation and filtering capabilities.

**Amplitude Experiment**: A/B testing and feature flagging platform that integrates with the analytics engine, supporting sequential testing methodology, mutual exclusion groups, and statistical significance calculations with configurable confidence intervals.

**Amplitude Data**: Data governance and tracking plan management system that enforces instrumentation limits (2000 event types, 2000 event properties, 1000 user properties per project) and provides hide/block/delete functionality for data quality control.

**Behavioral Cohorts**: Dynamic and static user segmentation system that creates reusable audience definitions based on user behavior patterns, integrable across charts and exportable via API.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events and Properties**:
- Events: User actions tracked in the system (e.g., "Button Clicked", "Page Viewed")
- Event Properties: Attributes describing specific event instances
- User Properties: Attributes describing users that persist across sessions
- Amplitude ID: Unique identifier assigned to each user profile

**User Identification**:
- Device ID: Platform-specific identifiers (Android UUID, iOS IDFV/IDFA)
- User ID: Custom identifier for known users
- Anonymous vs Known Users: Distinction between identified and unidentified user profiles

**Session Management**:
- Session ID: Identifier grouping related user activities
- Session Timeout: Configurable inactivity periods (30 minutes web, 5 minutes mobile default)
- Out-of-session Events: Events occurring outside defined session windows

**Chart-Specific Metrics**:
- Active %: Percentage calculations in Event Segmentation
- MTU (Monthly Tracked Users): Billing metric for unique users per month
- Conversion Windows: Time periods for funnel step completion (24-hour vs calendar-based)
- Retention Types: "Return On" vs "Return On or After" calculation methods

**Statistical Concepts**:
- Sequential Testing: Always-valid statistical methodology for experiments
- MDE (Minimum Detectable Effect): Smallest change experiments can reliably detect
- P-values and Confidence Intervals: Statistical significance measurements

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates extensively with external platforms and tools:

**Data Ingestion**: Multiple APIs including HTTP V2 API (30 events/second throttling), Batch Event Upload API for bulk processing, and SDK integrations for web/mobile platforms. Third-party integrations include Segment (cloud-mode vs device-mode), attribution partners (Appsflyer, Adjust, Branch, Singular), and custom webhook implementations.

**Data Export**: Export API for JSON format data extraction, Amazon S3 Export for automated data pipelines, Query add-on for Snowflake SQL access, and CSV exports with varying limits per chart type.

**Authentication and Access**: SSO integration with SAML/Google Workspace, role-based permissions (org admin/manager), and compliance with SOC2 Type 2, GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA standards.

**Third-party Platform Support**: JavaScript SDK implementation on website builders (Wix Tracking Tools & Analytics, Squarespace Code Injection), mobile attribution through Attribution API with 72-hour mapping windows, and proxy server configurations for Firefox tracking protection bypass.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Primary APIs**:
- HTTP V2 API: Real-time event ingestion with throttling limits
- Batch Event Upload API: Bulk data processing for backfills
- Export API: Historical data extraction in JSON format
- Behavioral Cohorts API: Cohort management and export with propKeys parameter
- Attribution API: Mobile attribution event mapping
- Identity API: User profile management and merging
- User Privacy API: GDPR compliance and data deletion

**SDK Configuration**:
- Android Kotlin SDK: `flushIntervalMillis`, `flushQueueSize` parameters
- iOS SDK: `eventUploadPeriodSeconds`, `eventUploadThreshold` settings
- JavaScript SDK: Proxy configuration for tracking protection bypass

**Chart-Specific Limits**:
- Event Segmentation: Various breakdown table limits
- Funnel Analysis: 300 group-by limit for CSV exports
- Data Tables: 10,000 rows export limit
- Retention Analysis: 12 months/365 days data range limit
- User Composition: Top 100 property values display

The platform enforces monthly event volume limits with overage fees, maintains instrumentation limits to ensure performance, and provides comprehensive troubleshooting documentation for common integration issues including data discrepancies with other platforms, missing attribution events, and session tracking variations.
