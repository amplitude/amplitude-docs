# Amplitude Analytics Platform

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics platform that enables organizations to track user behavior, analyze product usage, and optimize user experiences through data-driven insights. The platform provides a suite of analytics tools, experimentation capabilities, and data management features designed to help product teams understand user journeys and make informed decisions.

## Core Product Architecture and Features

### Analytics and Visualization
The platform centers around multiple chart types for different analytical needs:

- **Event Segmentation** charts for tracking user actions and behaviors with custom formulas (ROLLWIN, PROP()), group-by filtering, and percentage calculations including DAU/MAU ratios
- **Funnel Analysis** charts for conversion tracking with unique users vs event totals counting, 24-hour conversion windows, and revenue attribution
- **Retention Analysis** charts using weighted average calculations for "Return On" vs "Return On or After" retention types
- **User Composition** charts for analyzing user demographics and properties
- **Data Tables** for multi-dimensional analysis with group-by aggregation and CSV export capabilities (10,000 rows limit)
- **User Sessions** charts for session-based analytics
- **Personas** charts using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for behavioral clustering

### Experimentation Platform (Amplitude Experiment)
The experimentation suite includes:
- **Statistical testing** with sequential testing methodology providing always-valid p-values
- **Mutual exclusion groups** preventing users from being assigned to multiple experiments simultaneously
- **Duration estimates** predicting experiment completion time with 40-day caps
- **Experiment Results** charts with variant comparison and confidence interval calculations

### Data Management and Governance
**Amplitude Data** provides tracking plan governance with the ability to hide, block, or delete events and properties. The platform enforces instrumentation limits including 2000 event types per project, 2000 event properties, and 1000 user properties that affect data indexing and querying capabilities.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### User and Device Identification
- **Amplitude ID**: Platform-generated unique identifier for users
- **Device ID**: Platform-specific identifiers (Android UUID, iOS IDFV/IDFA)
- **User ID**: Custom identifier set by developers
- **Session ID**: Identifier for user sessions with configurable timeout periods

### Data Ingestion and Processing
- **Monthly Tracked Users (MTU)**: Billing metric with quotas and overage fees
- **Monthly Event Volume**: Total events ingested per calendar month with limits
- **Event Properties**: Attributes attached to specific events
- **User Properties**: Attributes attached to user profiles
- **Behavioral Cohorts**: Dynamic and static user groups based on behavior patterns

### Analytics Concepts
- **Group-by**: Segmentation method for breaking down data by properties
- **Breakdown Table**: Detailed view showing segmented results
- **Active %**: Percentage of users performing specific actions
- **New User**: Users performing their first tracked event
- **Conversion Window**: Time period for funnel step completion (typically 24 hours)

## Product Ecosystem Integration

### Data Ingestion APIs
- **HTTP V2 API**: Real-time event ingestion with 30 events/second throttling limits
- **Batch Event Upload API**: Bulk data processing for backfills and high-volume scenarios
- **Export API**: JSON format data extraction for analysis
- **Identify API**: User property updates and profile management
- **Attribution API**: Mobile attribution event mapping with 72-hour windows

### Third-Party Integrations
- **Segment Integration**: Cloud-mode and device-mode connections with debugging capabilities
- **Amazon S3 Export**: Bulk data export to S3 buckets
- **Mobile Attribution Partners**: Appsflyer, Adjust, Branch, Singular integration
- **Third-party Website Builders**: Wix Tracking Tools & Analytics, Squarespace Code Injection support

### SDK and Implementation
- **JavaScript SDK**: Web tracking with proxy server configuration for Firefox tracking protection
- **Mobile SDKs**: Android Kotlin SDK and iOS SDK with configurable event batching (flushIntervalMillis, eventUploadPeriodSeconds)
- **Server-side Integration**: HTTP API for backend event tracking

## Subscription Plans and Compliance

### Plan Tiers
- **Starter/Plus Plans**: Basic analytics with MTU limits and 1.2x overage pricing
- **Growth Plan**: Advanced features including Behavioral Cohorts, Pathfinder, SSO
- **Enterprise Plan**: Full feature access with custom data retention
- **Startup Scholarship**: Free Growth plan access for qualifying startups (less than $10M funding, fewer than 20 employees)

### Security and Compliance
The platform maintains SOC2 Type 2, GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA compliance with Data Processing Addendum (DPA) availability, Customer Trust Portal access, and Bug Bounty program procedures.

## Data Architecture and Limitations

Amplitude operates on an immutable data architecture with pre-aggregated hourly/daily/weekly/monthly datasets. Key limitations include:
- **CSV Export Limits**: Varying by chart type (typically 10,000 rows for Data Tables)
- **Date Range Limits**: 12 months/365 days for retention analysis
- **String Character Limit**: 1024 characters for property values
- **Instrumentation Limits**: 2000 event types, 2000 event properties, 1000 user properties per project

The platform uses batch ingestion systems with mobile SDK event batching thresholds (30 seconds/30 events) and provides various troubleshooting tools including the Microscope feature for detailed user journey analysis and channel classifier for acquisition tracking using UTM parameters and referring domains.
