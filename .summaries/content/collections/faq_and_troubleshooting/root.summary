# Amplitude Product Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics platform that helps organizations understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive business growth through data-driven insights. The platform enables teams to track, analyze, and act on user interactions across digital products and services.

## Key Features and Capabilities

Amplitude's core functionality centers on event-based analytics, allowing businesses to track and analyze user actions across digital touchpoints. The platform offers robust user identity management through various identifiers (Device ID, User ID, Amplitude ID), enabling consistent user tracking across sessions and devices.

Users can create behavioral cohorts based on specific actions and properties, facilitating targeted analysis of user segments. The platform provides powerful data visualization tools including event segmentation, funnel analysis, retention analysis, user composition, and personas to derive actionable insights from complex datasets.

For product experimentation, Amplitude offers A/B testing capabilities with statistical significance calculations and sequential testing methodology. The platform maintains strong data governance features to manage event and property visibility, blocking, and deletion, while ensuring compliance with SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA standards.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

### Data Collection Infrastructure

Amplitude provides multiple data ingestion methods:
- Mobile SDKs for iOS and Android applications
- JavaScript SDK for web applications
- HTTP V2 API (`https://api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`) for real-time, low-volume data (30 events/second limit)
- Batch Event Upload API (`https://api2.amplitude.com/batch`) for high-volume data transfers and backfills
- Integration with third-party platforms like Segment

The platform structures data into events (limited to 2000 types per project), event properties (limited to 2000 per project), user properties (limited to 1000 per project), and group properties. Amplitude allows data transformation through merging events and properties, with changes applying retroactively to existing charts.

### Analytics Capabilities

Amplitude offers diverse chart types for data analysis:
- Event Segmentation for analyzing event frequency and properties over time
- Funnel Analysis for tracking user progression through defined event sequences
- Retention Analysis for measuring user return rates
- User Composition for visualizing user property distributions
- Personas for clustering users by behavior using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization
- Data Tables for tabular views of analytics data
- Experiment Results for analyzing A/B test outcomes

The Experiment Platform supports A/B testing with statistical significance calculations, sequential testing methodology, experiment duration estimates, and mutual exclusion groups to prevent experiment interference.

User segmentation is facilitated through Behavioral Cohorts, Channel Classifier for defining acquisition channels, and filtering capabilities for excluding internal users.

### Data Export and Integration

Amplitude provides several export options:
- CSV exports with varying row limits by chart type
- Export API for JSON-formatted data
- Query Add-on (Amplitude SQL/Snowflake ETL)
- Amazon S3 Export for event data

The platform integrates with Segment for data collection, supports third-party site builders like Wix and Squarespace, and connects with mobile attribution partners.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Data Structure Terms
- **Events**: User actions tracked in Amplitude (e.g., page views, button clicks)
- **Event Properties**: Attributes attached to events (e.g., button color, page name)
- **User Properties**: Attributes attached to users (e.g., age, subscription tier)
- **Group Properties**: Attributes attached to organizational groups

### User Identification Terms
- **Device ID**: Unique identifier for a device
- **User ID**: Custom identifier assigned to logged-in users
- **Amplitude ID**: Amplitude's internal user identifier
- **IDFA/IDFV**: iOS advertising and vendor identifiers
- **ADID**: Android advertising identifier

### Analytics Terms
- **Sessions**: Series of user events grouped by time proximity (default 30-minute timeout)
- **MTU (Monthly Tracked Users)**: Unique users tracked per month, used for billing
- **Sequential Testing**: Statistical method allowing continuous monitoring without inflating false positives
- **T-test**: Traditional statistical significance test used in Funnel Analysis
- **p-value**: Probability measure for statistical significance

### Chart-Specific Terms
- **Dotted Line**: Indicates incomplete data still being collected
- **(none) Values**: Represents null values in properties
- **Return On vs Return On or After**: Different retention calculation methodologies

## Technical Implementation

### API Endpoints
- **HTTP V2 API**: `https://api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi` for real-time event tracking
- **Batch Event Upload API**: `https://api2.amplitude.com/batch` for high-volume data transfers
- **Export API**: For retrieving raw event data in JSON format
- **Identify API**: For updating user properties without sending events
- **Cohort API**: For programmatically managing behavioral cohorts

### SDK Configuration Parameters
- `flushIntervalMillis`: Controls event batching frequency
- `eventUploadThreshold`: Sets batch size for event uploads

## Subscription Plans and Limitations

Amplitude offers multiple subscription tiers:
- **Free Plan**: Basic analytics capabilities
- **Plus Plan**: Enhanced features with MTU guardrails
- **Growth Plan**: Advanced features with higher limits
- **Enterprise Plan**: Full feature set with custom limits
- **Startup Scholarship**: One year of Growth plan for qualifying startups

Technical limitations include:
- Monthly event volume limits (varies by plan)
