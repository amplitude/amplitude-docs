# Amplitude Analytics Platform

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics platform that provides product teams with behavioral analytics, experimentation capabilities, and user engagement insights. The platform centers around event-based tracking to understand user journeys, measure product performance, and optimize user experiences through data-driven decision making.

## Core Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem consists of several interconnected products and features:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the core analytics engine, featuring multiple chart types for different analytical needs:
- **Event Segmentation** charts for tracking user actions and behaviors over time
- **Funnel Analysis** for conversion tracking and optimization
- **Retention Analysis** for measuring user engagement and churn
- **User Composition** charts for demographic and property-based analysis
- **Data Tables** for multi-dimensional data exploration
- **User Sessions** charts for session-based analytics
- **Personas** for behavioral clustering using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)

**Amplitude Experiment** provides A/B testing and feature flagging capabilities with sophisticated statistical analysis including sequential testing methodology and mutual exclusion groups to prevent cross-experiment contamination.

**Amplitude Data** handles data governance through tracking plans, offering event and property management with hide/block/delete functionality to maintain data quality and manage instrumentation limits.

**Behavioral Cohorts** enable dynamic user segmentation based on behavioral patterns, integrating across all analytics charts and supporting both static and dynamic cohort creation.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Identifiers:**
- **User ID**: Custom identifier for known users
- **Device ID**: Platform-specific identifier (Android UUID, iOS IDFV/IDFA)
- **Amplitude ID**: Internal unique identifier for user profiles
- **Session ID**: Identifier for user session tracking with configurable timeout windows

**Data Structure:**
- **Events**: User actions tracked with timestamps and properties
- **Event Properties**: Attributes specific to individual events
- **User Properties**: Attributes associated with user profiles
- **MTU (Monthly Tracked Users)**: Billing metric for unique users per calendar month

**Analytics Concepts:**
- **Group-by**: Segmentation dimension for breaking down metrics
- **Filter-by**: Conditions for including/excluding data
- **Conversion Windows**: Time periods for funnel step completion (24-hour vs calendar-based)
- **Retention Types**: "Return On" vs "Return On or After" calculation methods

**Statistical Terms:**
- **Sequential Testing**: Always-valid statistical methodology for experiments
- **MDE (Minimum Detectable Effect)**: Smallest change an experiment can reliably detect
- **Exposure Events**: Actions that trigger experiment assignment
- **Attribution Models**: Methods for crediting conversion events

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates extensively with external platforms and tools:

**Data Ingestion:**
- **SDKs** for mobile (iOS, Android) and web (JavaScript) platforms
- **HTTP V2 API** for real-time event streaming (30 events/second limit)
- **Batch Event Upload API** for bulk data processing
- **Segment Integration** supporting both cloud-mode and device-mode connections

**Data Export:**
- **Export API** for JSON-formatted raw event data
- **Query Add-on** for Snowflake SQL access
- **Amazon S3 Export** for data warehouse integration
- **CSV exports** with chart-specific row limits

**Third-party Integrations:**
- **Attribution APIs** for mobile attribution partners (Appsflyer, Adjust, Branch, Singular)
- **Website builders** (Wix, Squarespace) through code injection
- **SSO providers** with SAML configuration support

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Primary APIs:**
- `/httpapi/v2/httpapi` - Real-time event ingestion
- `/batch` - Bulk event upload
- `/identify` - User property updates
- **Behavioral Cohorts API** - Cohort management with `propKeys` parameter for exports
- **Attribution API** - Mobile attribution event mapping with 72-hour window
- **Dashboard REST API** - Chart data access (1000 row limit)

**SDK Configuration:**
- **Android Kotlin SDK**: `flushIntervalMillis`, `flushQueueSize` for event batching
- **iOS SDK**: `eventUploadPeriodSeconds`, `eventUploadThreshold` for upload frequency
- **JavaScript SDK**: Proxy server configuration for Firefox tracking protection

**Data Governance:**
- **Channel Classifier** using `utm_medium` and `referring_domain` properties
- **Data Filters** for IP-based blocking and bot traffic filtering
- **Transformations** for event/property merging with retroactive application

## Platform Limits and Constraints

**Instrumentation Limits:**
- 2000 event types per project
- 2000 event properties per project  
- 1000 user properties per project
- 1024 character limit for string values

**Chart-Specific Limits:**
- **Event Segmentation**: 100 breakdown table property values
- **Funnel Analysis**: 300 group-by limit for CSV exports
- **Data Tables**: 10,000 baseline group-by limit
- **Retention Analysis**: 300 group-by limit, 12 months/365 days data range

**Plan-Based Features:**
- **Plus Plan**: MTU guardrails with 1,000 events per MTU limit, 1.2x overage pricing
- **Growth/Enterprise**: Channel classifier, advanced cohorts, extended data retention
- **Startup Scholarship**: 200,000 MTUs for qualifying startups (<$10M funding, <20 employees)

The platform emphasizes data immutability with pre-aggregated hourly/daily/weekly/monthly datasets, requiring specific workflows for historical data modifications through Export API and Batch API combinations.
