# Amplitude Product Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics platform that helps businesses understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform enables tracking, analyzing, and acting on user interactions across digital products and services.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Event-Based Analytics
Amplitude's core functionality revolves around tracking user events and behaviors across digital platforms. The architecture pre-aggregates data for efficient analysis, allowing businesses to understand how users interact with their products.

### User Identity Management
The platform uses multiple identifier types to track users across sessions and devices:
- Device ID: Primary identifier for anonymous users
- User ID: Identifier for logged-in users
- Amplitude ID: Internal identifier that links user activities
- Mobile identifiers: IDFA/IDFV/ADID for mobile advertising

Amplitude provides capabilities for merging user profiles when identities are connected.

### Visualization and Analysis Tools
Amplitude offers various chart types for data analysis:
- Event Segmentation: Analyzes event properties and user behaviors
- Funnel Analysis: Tracks user conversion through defined event sequences
- Retention Analysis: Measures user return rates over time
- User Sessions: Analyzes session-based metrics
- User Composition: Visualizes user property distributions
- Behavioral Cohorts: Groups users based on behavior patterns
- Personas: Uses Non-Negative Matrix Factorization to cluster similar users
- Data Tables: Provides tabular views of analytics data

### Experimentation
Amplitude Experiment enables A/B testing with advanced statistical methodologies:
- Sequential testing (mSPRT) for controlled false positive rates
- Traditional T-tests for certain analyses
- Confidence intervals and lift calculations
- Mutual exclusion groups to prevent experiment interference

### Data Management
The platform provides tools for data governance:
- Hide Events/Properties: Still collects data but hides from dropdowns
- Block Events/Properties: Stops collecting new data while preserving historical data
- Delete Events/Properties: Completely removes from ingestion and dropdowns
- Self-service data deletion for Growth/Enterprise plans

### Integration Ecosystem
Amplitude integrates with various platforms:
- Segment: Two-way integration for event tracking
- Mobile Attribution Partners: For tracking campaign performance
- Website Builders: Implementation support for Wix, Squarespace, etc.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

### Analytics Core
Events are the fundamental unit of data in Amplitude, with monthly event volume limits based on plan tier. Data is immutable after ingestion. Events can be sent via SDKs (JavaScript, iOS, Android) or server-side APIs.

### Data Export and Integration
- Export API for JSON-formatted data
- Amazon S3 Export for event data
- Query Add-on (Amplitude SQL/Snowflake ETL) for SQL-like queries
- CSV exports with varying limits by chart type (300-10,000 rows)

### Instrumentation Limits
- 2000 event types
- 2000 event properties
- 1000 user properties
- 1024 character limit for strings

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Session Concepts
- Session: A period of user activity, typically ended after 30 minutes of inactivity
- Session ID: Unique identifier for a user session
- Start Session Event: Explicit event to begin a new session

### Analysis Terminology
- (none) bucket: Represents null values in analytics
- Dotted line: Indicates incomplete data still being collected
- Return On vs Return On or After: Different retention calculation methodologies
- Weighted average: Method used for retention calculations

### Experiment Terminology
- Sequential testing: Statistical methodology that allows checking results at any time
- Mutual exclusion groups: Prevents users from participating in multiple experiments
- Sticky bucketing: Ensures users remain in the same experiment variant

## Product Ecosystem Integration

### Plan Tiers
- Free: Basic analytics capabilities
- Startup Scholarship: One-year access to Growth features for qualifying startups

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

### Data Ingestion APIs
- HTTP V2 API: For real-time, low-volume data (30 events/second limit)
- Batch Event Upload API: For high-volume data transfers and backfills
- Identify API: For updating user properties without sending events

### Data Export APIs
- Export API: For retrieving raw event data
- Behavioral Cohort API: For programmatically managing cohorts

### SDK Implementation
- Configuration options like `flushIntervalMillis` and `eventUploadThreshold`
- Session tracking parameters
- User identification methods
