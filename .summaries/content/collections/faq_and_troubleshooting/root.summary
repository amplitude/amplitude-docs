# Amplitude Product Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics platform that helps organizations understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive business growth through data-driven insights. The platform enables teams to track, analyze, and act on user interactions across digital products.

## Key Features and Capabilities

Amplitude's core functionality centers on event-based analytics, allowing organizations to track and analyze user behaviors across digital platforms. The platform provides robust user identity management through device IDs, user IDs, and Amplitude IDs to track users across sessions and devices. Users can leverage various visualization tools including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, and User Composition to identify patterns in user behavior.

The platform includes Amplitude Experiment for A/B testing with statistical significance calculations and sequential testing methodology. Users can create and analyze behavioral cohorts based on user actions and properties. Amplitude also offers comprehensive data management tools for handling data governance, transformations, and integrations with other platforms.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

### Data Collection
Amplitude provides multiple methods for collecting user data:
- SDKs for various platforms (JavaScript, iOS, Android)
- HTTP V2 API (`https://api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`) for real-time, low-volume data with a 30 events/second limit
- Batch Event Upload API for high-volume data transfers and backfills
- Integration with third-party platforms like Segment

### Data Processing
The platform processes data through:
- Pre-aggregated data sets that make historical data immutable
- User profile merging and identity resolution
- Transformations for event and property merging

### Analysis Tools
Amplitude offers a suite of analysis tools:
- Event Segmentation for analyzing event patterns
- Funnel Analysis for conversion tracking
- Retention Analysis for user retention metrics
- User Composition for demographic analysis
- Personas for behavioral clustering using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization
- Data Tables for detailed data exploration
- Experiment Results for A/B test analysis

### Data Export
Users can export data through:
- Export API for JSON-formatted data
- Query Add-on (Amplitude SQL/Snowflake ETL)
- Amazon S3 Export for event data

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Events**: User actions tracked in Amplitude, limited to 2000 event types per project.

2. **Properties**:
   - **Event Properties**: Attributes of events (limited to 2000 per project)
   - **User Properties**: Attributes of users (limited to 1000 per project)
   - **Group Properties**: Attributes of account/organization level entities

3. **Device ID**: Identifier for a specific device (IDFV on iOS by default, not IDFA).

4. **User ID**: Custom identifier assigned to logged-in users.

5. **Amplitude ID**: Amplitude's internal identifier for tracking users.

6. **Sessions**: Series of user events grouped by time proximity (default 30-minute timeout).

7. **MTU (Monthly Tracked Users)**: Unique users tracked per month, used for billing.

8. **Cohorts**: Groups of users who share common behaviors or attributes.

9. **Mutual Exclusion Groups**: Mechanism to prevent users from participating in multiple experiments.

10. **Dotted Line**: Indicator in charts showing incomplete data still being collected.

11. **(none) Values**: Representation of null values in property breakdowns.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates with various platforms in the broader product ecosystem:

### Data Sources
- Mobile app SDKs (iOS, Android)
- Web SDKs (JavaScript)
