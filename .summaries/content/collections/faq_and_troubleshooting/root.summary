- **Experiment Analysis**: Provides A/B testing tools with statistical significance calculations
- **Data Visualization**: Offers multiple chart types for analyzing user behavior patterns
- **Data Governance**: Includes capabilities to manage data visibility and collection
- **Integration Ecosystem**: Connects with third-party platforms like Segment and site builders

## Product Architecture and Relationships

### Data Collection Infrastructure

Amplitude offers multiple methods for collecting user data:

- **SDKs**: JavaScript SDK for web applications, Mobile SDKs for iOS and Android
- **APIs**: 
  - HTTP V2 API (`https://api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`) for real-time, low-volume data (30 events/second limit)
  - Batch Event Upload API for high-volume data transfers and backfills

### Analytics Features Hierarchy

1. **Core Analysis Tools**:
   - **Event Segmentation**: Analyzes event patterns with property breakdowns
   - **Funnel Analysis**: Tracks user progression through sequential events
   - **Retention Analysis**: Measures user return rates over time
   - **Pathfinder**: Visualizes user journey flows
   - **User Composition**: Analyzes user property distributions

2. **Advanced Analytics**:
   - **Behavioral Cohorts**: Creates user segments based on behavior patterns
   - **Personas**: Uses Non-Negative Matrix Factorization to cluster users
   - **Channel Classifier**: Defines acquisition channels for traffic source tracking

3. **Experimentation Framework**:
   - **Experiment Results**: Analyzes A/B test outcomes with statistical significance
   - **Sequential Testing**: Allows continuous monitoring of experiment results
   - **Mutual Exclusion Groups**: Prevents users from participating in multiple experiments

### Data Export Options

- **Export API**: Retrieves JSON-formatted data
- **Query Add-on**: Provides SQL-like queries (Amplitude SQL/Snowflake ETL)
- **Amazon S3 Export**: Exports event data to S3
- **CSV exports**: Available from charts with varying row limits by chart type
- **Cohort API**: Exports user segments with specific properties

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### User Identification System

- **Device ID**: Default identifier assigned by Amplitude SDKs
- **User ID**: Custom identifier for logged-in users
- **Amplitude ID**: Internal identifier for user tracking
- **IDFA/IDFV**: iOS advertising and vendor identifiers
- **ADID**: Android advertising identifier

### Data Structure Terminology

- **Events**: User actions tracked with timestamps
- **Event Properties**: Contextual information about events
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes about users
- **Group Properties**: Attributes for organizational hierarchies

### Analytics Metrics

- **MTU**: Monthly Tracked Users
- **Dotted Line**: Indicates incomplete data still being collected
- **(none) Value**: Represents null values in properties
- **Return On vs Return On or After**: Different retention calculation methodologies

### Data Governance Classifications

- **Hidden Events/Properties**: Still collect data but aren't visible in dropdowns
- **Blocked Events/Properties**: Stop collecting new data while preserving historical data
- **Deleted Events/Properties**: Completely removed from ingestion and dropdowns

## Product Ecosystem and Plans

### Plan Tiers

- **Free Plan**: Basic analytics capabilities
- **Plus Plan**: Enhanced features with MTU guardrails and 1000 events per MTU limit
- **Growth Plan**: Advanced features including Behavioral Cohorts and Pathfinder
- **Enterprise Plan**: Full feature set with advanced support
- **Startup Scholarship Plan**: One year of free Growth plan access for qualifying startups

### Technical Limitations

- **Data Volume Limits**: Monthly event volume limits vary by plan
- **Instrumentation Limits**: 2000 event types, 2000 event properties, 1000 user properties
- **String Character Limit**: 1024 characters
- **Browser Compatibility**: Firefox tracking protection blocks Amplitude SDK (requires proxy server)
- **iOS Tracking**: iOS 14 IDFA opt-in requirements affect certain tracking scenarios
- **Data Immutability**: Data cannot be modified after ingestion (pre-aggregated data architecture)

### Security and Compliance

- SOC2 Type 2 compliance
- GDPR/HIPPA/CCPA compliance
- Data Processing Addendum (DPA)
- Bug Bounty program
- Vulnerability scanning

Amplitude positions itself as a complete solution for organizations seeking to understand user behavior and make data-driven decisions while maintaining privacy compliance and data governance standards.
