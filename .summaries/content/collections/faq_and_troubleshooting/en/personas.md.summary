This documentation explains how Amplitude's Personas chart uses Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) instead of K-Means for user behavior clustering, addressing limitations in handling outliers and high-dimensional data by performing dimension reduction to create a more comprehensible "behavior space."
