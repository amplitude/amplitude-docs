## Summary
The Personas chart in Amplitude uses Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) instead of K-Means for clustering user behaviors, providing better handling of outliers and high-dimensional data by performing dimension reduction to create a more comprehensible "behavior space" where similar users cluster together.
