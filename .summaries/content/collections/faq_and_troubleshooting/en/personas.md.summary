## Summary
This documentation page addresses FAQs about the Personas chart in Amplitude, explaining how it uses Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) instead of K-Means for clustering user behaviors, which better handles outliers and high-dimensional data by performing dimension reduction to create a more comprehensible "behavior space."
