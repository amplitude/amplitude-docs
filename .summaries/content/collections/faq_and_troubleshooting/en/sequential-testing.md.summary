## Summary
This documentation page addresses frequently asked questions about sequential testing in Amplitude Experiment, explaining statistical concepts like power, confidence intervals, lift calculations, and measurement types (Uniques, Average Totals, Average Sum of Property), while demonstrating how sequential testing maintains controlled false positive rates compared to T-tests when analyzing experiment results at any time.
