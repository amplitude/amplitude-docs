**Summary:** This FAQ documentation covers Amplitude Experiment's sequential testing methodology, explaining statistical thresholds (25 conversions + 100 exposures for uniques, 100 exposures for totals), metric types (uniques, average totals, sum of property), lift calculations, and comparing sequential testing's always-valid p-values against T-test false positive inflation when peeking at results.
