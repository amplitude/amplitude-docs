**Summary:** This FAQ documentation covers Amplitude Experiment's sequential testing methodology, explaining statistical thresholds (25 conversions + 100 exposures for uniques, 100 exposures for totals), metric types (uniques, average totals, sum of property), lift calculations, and comparative advantages over T-tests including always-valid p-values and controlled Type 1 error rates.
