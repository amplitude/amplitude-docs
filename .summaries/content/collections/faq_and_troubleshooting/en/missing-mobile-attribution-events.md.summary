## Summary
This documentation explains why mobile attribution events may be missing in Amplitude, primarily due to identifier mismatches between attribution partners (using IDFA/IDFV/ADID) and Amplitude (using user_id/device_id/amplitude_id), and outlines troubleshooting steps for when events aren't mapped within the 72-hour retention window.
