## Summary
This documentation explains why user counts in Amplitude may show unexpected values, particularly the `(none)` bucket, which represents null values. It clarifies that Amplitude is event-based and displays property values as they were at the time of the event, not current values, and explains common scenarios for null values in event properties, user properties, location data, and device information.
