## Summary
This documentation compares the HTTP V2 API and Batch Event Upload API for Amplitude data ingestion, explaining that HTTP V2 is optimal for real-time, low-volume data (with a 30 events/second throttling limit), while Batch API is designed for high-volume data transfers, backfills, and migrations where immediate processing isn't required.
