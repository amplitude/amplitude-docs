## Summary
This documentation page addresses FAQs about exporting data from Amplitude, explaining that while direct export of selected raw data for charts or events isn't supported, alternatives include using the Export API for JSON-formatted data, the Query Add-on (Amplitude SQL/Snowflake ETL) for SQL-like queries, and Amazon S3 Export for exporting event data to S3 buckets.
