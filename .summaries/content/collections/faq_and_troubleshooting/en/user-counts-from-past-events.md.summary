**Summary:** This documentation explains why user counts for past events in Amplitude can fluctuate over time, covering causes like mobile SDK event batching (30 seconds/30 events threshold), Batch API delays, connectivity issues, and user profile merging between anonymous and known users, with specific configuration solutions for Android Kotlin SDK (flushIntervalMillis/flushQueueSize) and iOS SDK (eventUploadPeriodSeconds/eventUploadThreshold).
