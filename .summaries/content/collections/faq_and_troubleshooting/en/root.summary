## Amplitude Analytics Platform

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics platform that provides product teams with behavioral analytics, experimentation capabilities, and user journey insights. The platform centers around event-based tracking to understand user behavior across web and mobile applications, with robust features for data visualization, cohort analysis, funnel optimization, and A/B testing.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem consists of several interconnected products and features:

**Core Analytics Engine**: Built on an event-based data model that tracks user interactions as discrete events with associated properties. The platform uses immutable data architecture with pre-aggregated hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly data sets for fast query performance.

**Amplitude Analytics**: The primary analytics interface featuring multiple chart types including Event Segmentation (behavioral analysis), Funnel Analysis (conversion tracking), Retention Analysis (user engagement over time), User Composition (demographic analysis), Data Tables (multi-dimensional analysis), and User Sessions (session-based metrics).

**Amplitude Experiment**: A/B testing and feature flagging platform that integrates with the analytics engine, supporting sequential testing methodology, mutual exclusion groups, and statistical significance calculations with both T-test and sequential testing approaches.

**Amplitude Data**: Data governance and tracking plan management system that enforces schema validation, manages instrumentation limits, and provides event/property blocking, hiding, and deletion capabilities.

**Behavioral Cohorts**: Dynamic and static user segmentation system that creates reusable audience definitions based on behavioral criteria, integrating across all chart types and supporting API-based exports.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events and Properties**: Events represent user actions (e.g., "Button Clicked"), while event properties provide contextual data (e.g., button_name: "Sign Up"). User properties describe user attributes that persist across sessions.

**User Identification**: The platform uses multiple identifier types including User ID (custom identifier), Device ID (SDK-generated), and Amplitude ID (internal unique identifier). User merging combines anonymous and known user profiles.

**Sessions**: Time-bounded user activity periods with configurable timeout windows (30 minutes web, 5 minutes mobile by default). Session tracking differs from other platforms like Google Analytics in timeout behavior and midnight rollover handling.

**Cohorts**: User segments defined by behavioral criteria, available as dynamic (recalculated) or static (fixed membership) types. Behavioral Cohorts can span 3-year date ranges and integrate with the Behavioral Cohorts API.

**Statistical Testing**: Amplitude Experiment uses sequential testing with always-valid p-values, while Funnel Analysis charts use two-tailed T-tests. Both maintain 5% false positive rates with different minimum sample requirements.

## Data Ingestion and API Ecosystem

**HTTP V2 API**: Real-time event ingestion with 30 events/second throttling limits, suitable for streaming data and immediate processing needs.

**Batch Event Upload API**: High-volume data ingestion for backfills and bulk uploads without real-time processing requirements.

**Export API**: JSON format data extraction for raw event data, supporting custom date ranges and event filtering.

**Behavioral Cohorts API**: Programmatic cohort management with propKeys parameter support for detailed user property exports.

**Attribution API**: Mobile attribution event processing with 72-hour mapping windows for IDFA/IDFV/ADID advertising identifiers.

**Identity API**: User profile management and property updates, with delayed visibility until subsequent active events.

## Platform Limits and Constraints

**Instrumentation Limits**: 2000 event types, 2000 event properties, and 1000 user properties per project, with monthly event volume limits varying by plan tier.

**Chart-Specific Limits**: Event Segmentation supports 100 breakdown table values, Funnel Analysis allows 300 group-by limits, Data Tables permit 10,000 baseline limits, and CSV exports have varying row restrictions.

**Data Processing**: Mobile SDKs batch events (30 seconds/30 events threshold), while server-side integrations may experience ingestion delays affecting historical user count accuracy.

## Integration and Third-Party Support

**Segment Integration**: Cloud-mode and device-mode connection support with specific troubleshooting for sessionId tracking and property mapping limitations.

**Website Builders**: JavaScript SDK implementation support for Wix (Tracking Tools & Analytics), Squarespace (Code Injection/Code Block), with webhook fallbacks for restricted environments.

**Mobile Attribution**: Integration with Appsflyer, Adjust, Branch, and Singular attribution providers, with iOS 14 IDFA opt-in requirement considerations.

**Data Warehouses**: Query add-on for Snowflake SQL queries and Amazon S3 Export integration for data warehouse connectivity.

## Security and Compliance Framework

Amplitude maintains SOC2 Type 2, GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA compliance standards with comprehensive Data Processing Addendum (DPA) coverage. The platform includes User Privacy API for GDPR compliance, Customer Trust Portal access, and Bug Bounty program for security vulnerability management.
