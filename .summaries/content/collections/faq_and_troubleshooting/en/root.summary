# Amplitude Product Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics platform that helps organizations understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive business growth through data-driven insights. The platform enables teams to track, analyze, and act on user interactions across digital products.

## Key Features and Concepts

1. **Event-Based Analytics**: Amplitude's core functionality revolves around tracking user events and behaviors across digital platforms.

2. **User Identity Management**: The platform uses device IDs, user IDs, and Amplitude IDs to track users across sessions and devices.

3. **Visualization Tools**: Various chart types (Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Composition, etc.) help analyze user behavior patterns.

4. **Experimentation**: Amplitude Experiment enables A/B testing with statistical significance calculations and sequential testing methodology.

5. **Behavioral Cohorts**: Create and analyze user segments based on their actions and properties.

6. **Data Management**: Tools for handling data governance, transformations, and integrations with other platforms.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

### Core Analytics Components

1. **Data Collection**:
   - SDKs for various platforms (JavaScript, iOS, Android)
   - HTTP V2 API for real-time, low-volume data (30 events/second limit)
   - Batch Event Upload API for high-volume data transfers and backfills
   - Integration with third-party platforms like Segment

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Pre-aggregated data sets (making historical data immutable)
   - User profile merging and identity resolution
   - Transformations for event and property merging

3. **Analysis Tools**:
   - Event Segmentation for analyzing event patterns
   - Funnel Analysis for conversion tracking
   - Retention Analysis for user retention metrics
   - User Composition for demographic analysis
   - Personas for behavioral clustering using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization
   - Data Tables for detailed data exploration
   - Experiment Results for A/B test analysis

4. **Data Export**:
   - Export API for JSON-formatted data
   - Query Add-on (Amplitude SQL/Snowflake ETL)
   - Amazon S3 Export for event data

### Amplitude Experiment

Amplitude Experiment is integrated with the core analytics platform and provides:
- Sequential testing methodology
- Mutual exclusion groups to prevent users from participating in multiple experiments
- Duration estimates for experiment runtime
- Statistical significance calculations

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Events**: User actions tracked in Amplitude (limited to 2000 event types per project).

2. **Properties**:
   - **Event Properties**: Attributes of events (limited to 2000 per project)
   - **User Properties**: Attributes of users (limited to 1000 per project)
   - **Group Properties**: Attributes of account/organization level entities

3. **Device ID**: Identifier for a specific device (IDFV on iOS by default, not IDFA).

4. **User ID**: Custom identifier assigned to logged-in users.

5. **Amplitude ID**: Amplitude's internal identifier for tracking users.

6. **Sessions**: Series of user events grouped by time proximity (default 30-minute timeout).

7. **MTU (Monthly Tracked Users)**: Unique users tracked per month, used for billing.

8. **Cohorts**: Groups of users who share common behaviors or attributes.

9. **Mutual Exclusion Groups**: Mechanism to prevent users from participating in multiple experiments.

10. **Dotted Line**: Indicator in charts showing incomplete data still being collected.

11. **(none) Values**: Representation of null values in property breakdowns.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates with various platforms in the broader product ecosystem:

1. **Data Sources**:
   - Mobile app SDKs (iOS, Android)
   - Web SDKs (JavaScript)
   - Server-side implementations
   - Third-party site builders (Wix, Squarespace)
   - Segment and other data platforms

2. **Data Destinations**:
   - Amazon S3 for raw data export
   - Snowflake via ETL
   - Custom integrations via API

3. **Authentication Systems**:
   - SSO integration (Google Workspace, SAML)
   - Standard username/password

## API Endpoints and Commands

1. **HTTP V2 API**: `https://api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi` - For real-time event tracking

2. **Batch Event Upload API**: For high-volume data transfers and backfills

3. **Export API**: For exporting JSON-formatted data

4. **Identify API**: For updating user properties without logging events

5. **Cohort API**: For programmatically updating behavioral cohorts

6. **Attribution API**: For mapping mobile attribution events

## Plan Types and Limitations

1. **Plan Types**:
   - Startup Scholarship (free Growth plan for eligible startups)
   - Plus Plan (with MTU guardrails)
   - Growth Plan
   - Enterprise Plan

2. **Instrumentation Limits**:
   - 2000 event types per project
   - 2000 event properties per project
   - 1000 user properties per project
   - 1024 characters for string values

3. **Export Limits**:
   - CSV download limits vary by chart type (300-10,000 rows)
   - Chart-specific visualization limits

4. **Data Retention**:
   - 72-hour window for mobile attribution event mapping
   - Varying retention periods based on plan
