# Amplitude Product Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics platform that helps organizations understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive business growth through data-driven insights. The platform enables teams to track, analyze, and act on user interactions across digital products.

## Key Features and Concepts

1. **Event-Based Analytics**: Amplitude's core functionality revolves around tracking user events and behaviors across digital products.

2. **User Identity Management**: The platform uses various identifiers (Device ID, User ID, Amplitude ID) to track users across sessions and devices.

3. **Behavioral Cohorts**: Allows creation of user segments based on specific behaviors or properties for targeted analysis.

4. **Experiment Analysis**: Provides tools for A/B testing with statistical significance calculations and sequential testing methodology.

5. **Data Visualization**: Offers various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Composition, and Personas.

6. **Data Governance**: Includes capabilities to hide, block, or delete events and properties to manage data visibility and collection.

7. **Integration Ecosystem**: Supports connections with third-party platforms like Segment and various site builders.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

### Data Collection and Management

1. **SDKs and APIs**:
   - JavaScript SDK for web applications
   - Mobile SDKs for iOS and Android
   - HTTP V2 API for real-time, low-volume data (30 events/second limit)
   - Batch Event Upload API for high-volume data transfers and backfills

2. **Data Limitations**:
   - Monthly event volume limits (varies by plan)
   - Instrumentation limits: 2000 event types, 2000 event properties, 1000 user properties
   - String character limit: 1024 characters

3. **Data Structure**:
   - Events: User actions tracked with timestamps
   - Event Properties: Contextual information about events
   - User Properties: Persistent attributes about users
   - Group Properties: Attributes for organizational hierarchies

### Analytics Features

1. **Core Analysis Tools**:
   - **Event Segmentation**: Analyzes event patterns with breakdowns by properties
   - **Funnel Analysis**: Tracks user progression through sequential events
   - **Retention Analysis**: Measures user return rates over time
   - **Pathfinder**: Visualizes user journey flows
   - **User Composition**: Analyzes user property distributions

2. **Advanced Analytics**:
   - **Behavioral Cohorts**: Creates user segments based on behavior patterns
   - **Personas**: Uses Non-Negative Matrix Factorization to cluster users by behavior
   - **Channel Classifier**: Defines acquisition channels for traffic source tracking

3. **Experimentation**:
   - **Experiment Results**: Analyzes A/B test outcomes with statistical significance
   - **Sequential Testing**: Allows continuous monitoring of experiment results
   - **Mutual Exclusion Groups**: Prevents users from participating in multiple experiments

### Data Export and Integration

1. **Export Options**:
   - Export API for JSON-formatted data
   - Query Add-on (Amplitude SQL/Snowflake ETL) for SQL-like queries
   - Amazon S3 Export for event data
   - CSV exports from charts (with varying row limits by chart type)

2. **Third-Party Integrations**:
   - Segment integration for data collection
   - Support for implementation on site builders like Wix and Squarespace

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **User Identification**:
   - **Device ID**: Default identifier assigned by Amplitude SDKs
   - **User ID**: Custom identifier for logged-in users
   - **Amplitude ID**: Internal identifier for user tracking
   - **IDFA/IDFV**: iOS advertising and vendor identifiers
   - **ADID**: Android advertising identifier

2. **Session Management**:
   - **Session**: Group of user activities with configurable timeout (default 30 minutes)
   - **Session ID**: Unique identifier for a user session

3. **Analytics Terminology**:
   - **MTU**: Monthly Tracked Users
   - **Dotted Line**: Indicates incomplete data still being collected
   - **(none) Value**: Represents null values in properties
   - **Return On vs Return On or After**: Different retention calculation methodologies

4. **Data Governance**:
   - **Hidden Events/Properties**: Still collect data but aren't visible in dropdowns
   - **Blocked Events/Properties**: Stop collecting new data while preserving historical data
   - **Deleted Events/Properties**: Completely removed from ingestion and dropdowns

## Product Plans and Ecosystem

1. **Plan Tiers**:
   - **Free Plan**: Basic analytics capabilities
   - **Plus Plan**: Enhanced features with MTU guardrails and 1000 events per MTU limit
   - **Growth Plan**: Advanced features including Behavioral Cohorts and Pathfinder
   - **Enterprise Plan**: Full feature set with advanced support
   - **Startup Scholarship Plan**: One year of free Growth plan access for qualifying startups

2. **Security and Compliance**:
   - SOC2 Type 2 compliance
   - GDPR/HIPPA/CCPA compliance
   - Data Processing Addendum (DPA)
   - Bug Bounty program
   - Vulnerability scanning

## API Endpoints and Technical Details

1. **Data Ingestion APIs**:
   - HTTP V2 API: `https://api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`
   - Batch Event Upload API: For high-volume data transfers

2. **Export APIs**:
   - Export API: For retrieving JSON-formatted data
   - Cohort API: For exporting user segments with specific properties

3. **SDK Configuration Parameters**:
   - `flushIntervalMillis`: Controls event batching frequency
   - `eventUploadThreshold`: Sets batch size for event uploads

4. **Technical Limitations**:
   - Firefox tracking protection blocks Amplitude SDK (requires proxy server)
   - iOS 14 IDFA opt-in requirements affect certain tracking scenarios
   - Data is immutable after ingestion (pre-aggregated data architecture)

The platform emphasizes data-driven decision making while providing tools for privacy compliance and data governance, making it suitable for organizations of various sizes seeking to understand and optimize user experiences.
