## Amplitude Analytics Platform

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics platform that enables organizations to track, analyze, and optimize user behavior across web and mobile applications. The platform provides real-time event tracking, advanced analytics visualizations, experimentation capabilities, and data management tools to help businesses make data-driven decisions.

## Core Product Architecture and Features

### Analytics and Visualization Engine
The platform centers around multiple chart types for behavioral analysis:
- **Event Segmentation** charts for tracking user actions with custom formulas (ROLLWIN, PROP()), group-by filtering, and Active % metrics
- **Funnel Analysis** for conversion tracking with unique users vs event totals counting, 24-hour conversion windows, and revenue attribution
- **Retention Analysis** using weighted average calculations for "Return On" vs "Return On or After" retention types
- **User Composition** charts for demographic and property-based user analysis
- **Data Tables** for multi-dimensional analysis with attribution model pruning and CSV export capabilities
- **User Sessions** charts for session-based behavioral tracking
- **Personas** clustering using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for behavioral segmentation

### Data Ingestion and Management
Amplitude operates as an event-based analytics platform with immutable data architecture using pre-aggregated hourly/daily/weekly/monthly sets. Key data management features include:

- **Multiple ingestion methods**: JavaScript SDK, mobile SDKs (iOS/Android), HTTP V2 API, and Batch Event Upload API
- **Instrumentation limits**: 2000 event types, 2000 event properties, and 1000 user properties per project
- **Monthly event volume limits** with overage fee structures
- **Data governance** through Amplitude Data's tracking plan with hide/block/delete capabilities
- **Real-time processing** via HTTP V2 API (30 events/second throttling) vs batch processing via Batch API

### Experimentation Platform (Amplitude Experiment)
The experimentation suite includes:
- **Sequential testing methodology** with statistical thresholds (25 conversions + 100 exposures)
- **Mutual exclusion groups** preventing users from multiple simultaneous experiments
- **Duration estimates** with 40-day caps using means, variances, and exposures
- **Statistical significance calculations** comparing sequential testing vs T-test approaches

### User and Cohort Management
- **Behavioral Cohorts** for dynamic and static user grouping with CSV upload support
- **User segmentation** by ID, properties, and behavioral patterns
- **Identity resolution** merging anonymous and known user profiles
- **Internal user filtering** via IP blocking and saved segments

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Core Identifiers
- **Amplitude ID**: Platform-generated unique identifier for user tracking
- **Device ID**: SDK-generated identifier (Android UUID, iOS IDFV/IDFA)
- **User ID**: Customer-defined identifier for known users
- **Session ID**: Configurable session tracking with timeout windows (30-minute web, 5-minute mobile default)

### Data Processing Concepts
- **MTU (Monthly Tracked Users)**: Billing metric for unique users per calendar month
- **EPUS/EPDS**: Events per user/device per second for rate limiting
- **Attribution API**: 72-hour mapping window for IDFA/IDFV/ADID mobile attribution
- **GeoIP mapping**: Location property enrichment using MaxMind database

### Chart-Specific Terminology
- **Group-by aggregation**: Segmentation method with unique metric discrepancies
- **Breakdown tables**: Detailed data views with 100 property value limits
- **Dotted line indicators**: Incomplete data collection periods
- **(none) buckets**: Null property values in event-based querying
- **Microscope feature**: Drill-down capability for user-level analysis

### Statistical and Experimental Terms
- **Sequential testing**: Always-valid p-values vs T-test false positive inflation
- **Lift calculations**: Absolute and relative improvement measurements
- **Conversion windows**: Time-based analysis periods (24-hour vs calendar dates)
- **Sticky bucketing**: Consistent experiment variant assignment

## Product Ecosystem Integration

### Third-Party Integrations
- **Segment integration** supporting cloud-mode and device-mode connections with sessionId tracking
- **Attribution partners**: Appsflyer, Adjust, Branch, Singular for mobile attribution
- **Website builders**: Wix Tracking Tools & Analytics, Squarespace Code Injection
- **Amazon S3 Export** for bulk data export and warehousing

### API Ecosystem
- **Export API**: JSON format data extraction for analysis and backfills
- **Behavioral Cohorts API**: Programmatic cohort management with propKeys parameters
- **Identity API**: User profile creation and management
- **Dashboard REST API**: Chart data access with 1000 row limits
- **User Privacy API**: GDPR compliance and data deletion

### Authentication and Access Control
- **SSO integration** with SAML certificate configuration and Google Workspace
- **Permission levels**: Org admin/manager access for advanced features
- **Plan-based feature access**: Growth/Enterprise features like channel classifier and advanced analytics

## Plan Structure and Limitations

### Subscription Tiers
- **Starter/Plus plans**: Basic analytics with MTU quotas and 1.2x overage rates
- **Growth plan**: Advanced features including Behavioral Cohorts, Pathfinder, and custom data retention
- **Enterprise plan**: Full feature access with enhanced security and compliance
- **Startup Scholarship**: One-year free Growth plan access for qualifying startups

### Technical Constraints
- **CSV export limits**: Varying by chart type (300 for Funnels, 10,000 for Data Tables)
- **Date range limitations**: 3-year range for inline behavioral cohorts, 12 months for retention analysis
- **String character limits**: 1024 characters for property values
- **Mobile SDK batching**: 30-second/30-event thresholds with configurable parameters

### Compliance and Security
- **SOC2 Type 2, GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA** compliance standards
- **Data Processing Addendum (DPA)** and Terms of Service
- **Customer Trust Portal** access and Bug Bounty program
- **Bot filtering** and traffic validation mechanisms

The platform serves as a comprehensive analytics solution bridging data collection, analysis, experimentation, and user management within a unified ecosystem designed for scalable behavioral analytics and optimization.
