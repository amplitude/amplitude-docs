# Amplitude Product Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics platform that helps organizations understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive business growth through data-driven insights. The platform enables teams to track, analyze, and act on user interactions across digital products.

## Key Features and Concepts

1. **Event-Based Analytics**: Amplitude's core functionality revolves around tracking user events and properties to understand behavior patterns.

2. **User Identity Management**: The platform uses device IDs, user IDs, and Amplitude IDs to track users across sessions and devices, with capabilities for merging anonymous and identified user profiles.

3. **Visualization Tools**: Various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, User Composition, and Behavioral Cohorts.

4. **Experimentation**: A/B testing capabilities with statistical significance calculations and sequential testing methodology.

5. **Data Governance**: Controls for hiding, blocking, or deleting events and properties, with instrumentation limits and data management features.

6. **Integration Ecosystem**: Connections with third-party platforms like Segment, attribution partners, and export capabilities.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

### Core Analytics Platform

1. **Data Collection**:
   - HTTP V2 API: For real-time, low-volume data ingestion (30 events/second limit)
   - Batch Event Upload API: For high-volume data transfers, backfills, and migrations
   - SDKs for various platforms (iOS, Android, JavaScript)
   - Third-party integrations (Segment, etc.)

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Event Segmentation: Analyze user behavior with property breakdowns
   - Funnel Analysis: Track conversion paths with different ordering options
   - Retention Analysis: Measure user return rates over time
   - User Sessions: Analyze session-based metrics
   - Behavioral Cohorts: Group users based on behavior patterns
   - Personas: Cluster users based on behavior using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization

3. **Data Export**:
   - Export API: For JSON-formatted data
   - Query Add-on (Amplitude SQL/Snowflake ETL): For SQL-like queries
   - Amazon S3 Export: For exporting event data to S3 buckets

### Amplitude Experiment

A feature for running A/B tests with:
- Sequential testing methodology
- Mutual exclusion groups to prevent users from seeing multiple experiments
- Duration estimates for statistical significance
- Support for various metric types (Uniques, Average Totals, Average Sum of Property)

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Events**: User actions tracked in the system (limited to 2000 event types per project)
   - **Event Properties**: Attributes of events (limited to 2000 per project)
   - **User Properties**: Attributes of users (limited to 1000 per project)

2. **Identifiers**:
   - **Device ID**: Unique identifier for a device (IDFV on iOS by default)
   - **User ID**: Custom identifier for logged-in users
   - **Amplitude ID**: Amplitude's internal user identifier

3. **Sessions**:
   - Default timeout: 30 minutes of inactivity
   - Can be customized with Start Session events or custom timeout windows
   - Session ID: Timestamp of the first event in a session

4. **Cohorts**:
   - **Dynamic Cohorts**: Update automatically as users meet criteria
   - **Static Cohorts**: Fixed list of users at a point in time

5. **Statistical Metrics**:
   - **Sequential Testing**: Always-valid statistical methodology that allows continuous monitoring
   - **Two-tailed T-test**: Traditional statistical test used in Funnel Analysis

6. **Data Visualization**:
   - **Dotted Line**: Indicates incomplete data still being collected
   - **(none) Value**: Represents null values in properties

## Subscription Plans

1. **Free Plan**: Basic analytics capabilities

2. **Plus Plan**: Enhanced features with MTU guardrails and 1000 events per MTU limit

3. **Growth Plan**: Advanced features including Behavioral Cohorts and Pathfinder

4. **Enterprise Plan**: Full feature set with advanced security and support

5. **Startup Scholarship Plan**: One year of free access to Growth plan features for qualifying startups

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - HTTP V2 API: `https://api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`
   - Batch Event Upload API: For high-volume data transfers

2. **Identity API**: For user identification and property updates

3. **Export API**: For retrieving data in JSON format

4. **Cohort API**: For programmatically accessing cohort data

5. **Attribution API**: For connecting mobile attribution events

## Common Troubleshooting Areas

1. **Access Issues**: Login errors, SSO authentication problems (500/403 errors)

2. **Data Discrepancies**: Differences between Amplitude and other platforms due to time zones, event tracking, bot filtering, etc.

3. **Missing Data**: Often related to instrumentation limits, hidden/blocked events, or ingestion delays

4. **Browser Compatibility**: Firefox tracking protection can block Amplitude SDK, requiring proxy server implementation

5. **Data Limitations**: Monthly event volume limits, instrumentation limits, and character limits for strings (1024 characters)

Amplitude's architecture is designed to be immutable after data ingestion, with specific workarounds for modifying historical data when necessary. The platform emphasizes security and privacy compliance with SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA standards.
