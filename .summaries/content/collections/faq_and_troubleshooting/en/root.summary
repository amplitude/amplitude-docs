Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics platform that provides product teams with behavioral analytics, experimentation capabilities, and user engagement insights. The platform centers around event-based analytics, tracking user interactions across web and mobile applications to help organizations understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven decision making.

## Core Product Architecture and Features

Amplitude's analytics platform is built on an event-based architecture that ingests user interactions through multiple SDKs (JavaScript, iOS, Android) and APIs (HTTP V2 API, Batch Event Upload API). The platform processes this data into pre-aggregated hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly datasets that power various analytical charts and reports. Key analytical capabilities include Event Segmentation for tracking user actions, Funnel Analysis for conversion optimization, Retention Analysis for user engagement measurement, and Behavioral Cohorts for user segmentation.

The platform includes Amplitude Experiment for A/B testing and feature experimentation, utilizing advanced statistical methods like sequential testing and mutual exclusion groups. Amplitude Data provides governance capabilities through tracking plans that manage event and property schemas, while supporting data export through the Export API and Amazon S3 integration for downstream analysis.

## Product Relationships and Integration Ecosystem

Amplitude integrates extensively with third-party platforms including Segment for data ingestion, attribution providers (Appsflyer, Adjust, Branch, Singular) for mobile attribution tracking, and website builders (Wix, Squarespace) for web analytics implementation. The Attribution API provides a 72-hour mapping window for connecting advertising IDs (IDFA, IDFV, ADID) to user profiles, enabling mobile attribution analysis.

The platform supports various authentication methods including SSO with SAML certificate configuration and Google Workspace integration. Data governance features include IP address blocking through Data Filters, internal user filtering via the Segmentation Module, and comprehensive user privacy controls supporting GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA compliance requirements.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Monthly Tracked Users (MTUs)**: The primary billing metric representing unique users tracked within a calendar month, with specific limits and overage policies across different plan tiers.

**Device ID vs User ID vs Amplitude ID**: Core identity resolution system where Device ID represents anonymous users (Android UUID, iOS IDFV/IDFA), User ID represents known authenticated users, and Amplitude ID serves as the internal unified identifier.

**Event Properties vs User Properties**: Event properties capture contextual information at the time of each event, while user properties represent persistent attributes stored separately and applied retroactively to historical events.

**Sequential Testing**: Advanced statistical methodology used in Amplitude Experiment that provides always-valid p-values and controlled Type 1 error rates, requiring minimum thresholds of 25 conversions plus 100 exposures for unique metrics.

**Behavioral Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments based on behavioral criteria that can be created through the Behavioral Cohort API and used across charts for consistent user grouping and analysis.

## Technical Implementation and API Endpoints

The platform provides multiple data ingestion endpoints including the HTTP V2 API with 30 events/second throttling limits for real-time streaming, and the Batch Event Upload API for bulk data processing and backfills. The Export API enables raw event data extraction in JSON format, while the Dashboard REST API supports programmatic chart data access.

Key SDK configuration parameters include mobile event batching thresholds (30 seconds/30 events), session timeout windows (30 minutes web, 5 minutes mobile), and upload frequency controls (flushIntervalMillis, eventUploadPeriodSeconds). The Identity API manages user profile updates and property modifications.

## Data Limits and Constraints

Amplitude enforces several operational limits including 2000 event types per project, 2000 event properties, and 1000 user properties with 1024 character string limits. CSV exports are capped at 10,000 rows for Event Segmentation and Data Tables, 300 rows for Funnel Analysis, and 1 million rows for Microscope downloads. Chart-specific limitations include 30 segments for breakdown tables and 3-year date ranges for inline behavioral cohorts.

## Plan Tiers and Billing Structure

The platform offers multiple plan tiers including Free, Plus, Growth, and Enterprise with varying MTU limits and feature access. The Startup Scholarship plan provides qualifying startups (under $10M funding, fewer than 20 employees) with one year of free Growth plan access including 200,000 MTUs. Overage fees apply at 1.2x rates for Plus plans, with automatic account blocking policies for significant overages.
