# Amplitude Product Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics platform that helps organizations understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive business growth through data-driven insights. The platform enables teams to track, analyze, and act on user interactions across digital products and services.

## Key Features and Concepts

1. **Event-Based Analytics**: Amplitude's core functionality revolves around tracking user events and behaviors across digital platforms.

2. **User Identity Management**: The platform uses various identifiers (Device ID, User ID, Amplitude ID) to track users across sessions and devices.

3. **Behavioral Cohorts**: Allows creation of user segments based on specific behaviors and properties for targeted analysis.

4. **Experiment Analysis**: Provides tools for A/B testing with statistical significance calculations and sequential testing methodology.

5. **Data Visualization**: Offers various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Composition, and Personas.

6. **Data Governance**: Includes capabilities to manage event and property visibility, blocking, and deletion.

7. **Integration Ecosystem**: Supports connections with third-party platforms like Segment and various site builders.

8. **Security and Compliance**: Maintains SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA compliance for data security and privacy.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

### Data Collection and Management

1. **SDKs and APIs**: Amplitude offers multiple data ingestion methods:
   - Mobile SDKs (iOS, Android)
   - JavaScript SDK for web applications
   - HTTP V2 API for real-time, low-volume data (30 events/second limit)
   - Batch Event Upload API for high-volume data transfers and backfills
   - Third-party integrations (e.g., Segment)

2. **Data Structure**:
   - Events (limited to 2000 types per project)
   - Event properties (limited to 2000 per project)
   - User properties (limited to 1000 per project)
   - Group properties

3. **Data Transformation**: Allows merging of events and properties with retroactive application to existing charts.

### Analytics Capabilities

1. **Chart Types**:
   - **Event Segmentation**: Analyzes event frequency and properties over time
   - **Funnel Analysis**: Tracks user progression through defined event sequences
   - **Retention Analysis**: Measures user return rates over time
   - **User Composition**: Visualizes user property distributions
   - **Personas**: Uses Non-Negative Matrix Factorization to cluster users by behavior
   - **Data Tables**: Provides tabular views of analytics data
   - **Experiment Results**: Analyzes A/B test outcomes with statistical rigor

2. **Experiment Platform**:
   - Supports A/B testing with statistical significance calculations
   - Offers sequential testing methodology for continuous monitoring
   - Provides experiment duration estimates
   - Implements mutual exclusion groups to prevent experiment interference

3. **User Segmentation**:
   - Behavioral Cohorts for creating user segments based on actions
   - Channel Classifier for defining acquisition channels
   - Filtering capabilities for excluding internal users

### Data Export and Integration

1. **Export Options**:
   - CSV exports (with varying row limits by chart type)
   - Export API for JSON-formatted data
   - Query Add-on (Amplitude SQL/Snowflake ETL)
   - Amazon S3 Export for event data

2. **Integrations**:
   - Segment integration for data collection
   - Support for third-party site builders (Wix, Squarespace)
   - Mobile attribution partners

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Events**: User actions tracked in Amplitude (e.g., page views, button clicks)

2. **Properties**:
   - **Event Properties**: Attributes attached to events (e.g., button color, page name)
   - **User Properties**: Attributes attached to users (e.g., age, subscription tier)
   - **Group Properties**: Attributes attached to organizational groups

3. **Identifiers**:
   - **Device ID**: Unique identifier for a device
   - **User ID**: Custom identifier assigned to logged-in users
   - **Amplitude ID**: Amplitude's internal user identifier
   - **IDFA/IDFV**: iOS advertising and vendor identifiers
   - **ADID**: Android advertising identifier

4. **Sessions**: Series of user events grouped by time proximity (default 30-minute timeout)

5. **MTU (Monthly Tracked Users)**: Unique users tracked per month, used for billing

6. **Statistical Terms**:
   - **Sequential Testing**: Statistical method allowing continuous monitoring without inflating false positives
   - **T-test**: Traditional statistical significance test used in Funnel Analysis
   - **p-value**: Probability measure for statistical significance

7. **Chart-Specific Terms**:
   - **Dotted Line**: Indicates incomplete data still being collected
   - **(none) Values**: Represents null values in properties
   - **Return On vs Return On or After**: Different retention calculation methodologies

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementations

1. **HTTP V2 API**: `https://api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi` - For real-time event tracking

2. **Batch Event Upload API**: `https://api2.amplitude.com/batch` - For high-volume data transfers

3. **Export API**: For retrieving raw event data in JSON format

4. **Identify API**: For updating user properties without sending events

5. **Cohort API**: For programmatically managing behavioral cohorts

6. **SDK Configuration Parameters**:
   - `flushIntervalMillis`: Controls event batching frequency
   - `eventUploadThreshold`: Sets batch size for event uploads

## Subscription Plans and Limitations

1. **Plan Types**:
   - **Free Plan**: Basic analytics capabilities
   - **Plus Plan**: Enhanced features with MTU guardrails
   - **Growth Plan**: Advanced features with higher limits
   - **Enterprise Plan**: Full feature set with custom limits
