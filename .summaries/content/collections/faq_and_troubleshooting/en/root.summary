# Amplitude Product Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics platform that helps organizations understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive business growth through data-driven insights. The platform enables teams to track, analyze, and act on user interactions across digital products.

## Key Features and Concepts

1. **Event-Based Analytics**: Amplitude's core functionality revolves around tracking user events and behaviors across digital platforms.

2. **User Identity Management**: The platform uses various identifiers (Device ID, User ID, Amplitude ID) to track users across sessions and devices.

3. **Behavioral Cohorts**: Allows creation of user segments based on specific behaviors or properties for targeted analysis.

4. **Experiment Analysis**: Built-in A/B testing capabilities with statistical significance calculations and duration estimates.

5. **Data Visualization**: Various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Composition, and Personas.

6. **Data Governance**: Controls for hiding, blocking, or deleting events and properties to manage data visibility and collection.

7. **Integration Capabilities**: Connects with third-party platforms like Segment and supports various data export options.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

### Data Collection and Management

- **SDKs and APIs**: Amplitude offers multiple methods for data ingestion:
  - Client-side SDKs (JavaScript, iOS, Android)
  - Server-side APIs (HTTP V2 API, Batch Event Upload API)
  - Third-party integrations (Segment)

- **Data Processing Pipeline**:
  1. Events are collected through SDKs or APIs
  2. Data is processed and stored in pre-aggregated data sets
  3. Historical data is generally immutable after ingestion

- **Data Governance Tools**:
  - Hide events/properties (still collect data but hide from UI)
  - Block events/properties (stop collecting new data)
  - Delete events/properties (completely remove from ingestion)

### Analytics and Visualization

- **Chart Types**:
  - Event Segmentation: Analyze event patterns and properties
  - Funnel Analysis: Track user conversion through defined steps
  - Retention Analysis: Measure user return rates over time
  - User Composition: Analyze user property distributions
  - Personas: Cluster users based on behavioral patterns
  - Data Tables: Tabular representation of analytics data

- **Experiment Platform**:
  - A/B testing with statistical significance calculations
  - Sequential testing methodology
  - Mutual exclusion groups to prevent experiment interference
  - Duration estimates for experiment planning

### User Management

- **User Identification**:
  - Device ID: Default identifier (IDFV on iOS)
  - User ID: Custom identifier for logged-in users
  - Amplitude ID: System-generated identifier
  - User profile merging to connect anonymous and identified activity

- **User Segmentation**:
  - Behavioral Cohorts based on actions or properties
  - Saved segments for reuse across analyses
  - Dynamic vs. static cohort definitions

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Events**: User actions tracked in Amplitude (e.g., page views, button clicks)
   - Limited to 2000 event types per project

2. **Properties**:
   - **Event Properties**: Attributes attached to events (limited to 2000 per project)
   - **User Properties**: Attributes attached to users (limited to 1000 per project)
   - **Group Properties**: Attributes for account/organization level analysis

3. **MTU (Monthly Tracked Users)**: Unique users tracked per month, a key billing metric

4. **Sessions**: Series of user events grouped by time proximity
   - Default timeout: 30 minutes of inactivity
   - Customizable session definitions

5. **Statistical Significance**: Confidence that observed differences aren't due to chance
   - Uses two-tailed T-test for Funnel Analysis
   - Uses sequential testing (mSPRT) for Experiment Results

6. **Instrumentation Limits**:
   - 2000 event types per project
   - 2000 event properties per project
   - 1000 user properties per project
   - 1024 character limit for string values

7. **Channel Classifier**: Feature to define acquisition channels for traffic source tracking

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates with various components of the digital product stack:

1. **Data Sources**:
   - Direct SDK implementation
   - Segment integration
   - Server-side API implementations
   - Third-party site builders (Wix, Squarespace)

2. **Data Destinations**:
   - Export API for JSON-formatted data
   - Query Add-on (Amplitude SQL/Snowflake ETL)
   - Amazon S3 Export for event data

3. **Experiment Platform**:
   - Integrates with the core analytics for experiment analysis
   - Supports local and remote evaluation

4. **Compliance and Security**:
   - SOC2 Type 2 compliance
   - GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA compliance
   - Data Processing Addendum (DPA) available

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementations

1. **HTTP V2 API**:
   - Optimal for real-time, low-volume data
   - Throttling limit: 30 events/second
   - Used for immediate event processing

2. **Batch Event Upload API**:
   - Designed for high-volume data transfers
   - Used for backfills and migrations
   - No immediate processing requirement

3. **Cohort API**:
   - Export cohorts with specific user properties
   - Manage behavioral cohorts programmatically

4. **Export API**:
   - Export raw event data in JSON format
   - Alternative to direct chart data export

5. **Identify API**:
   - Update user properties without sending events
   - Note: requires subsequent "active" events to appear in User Composition
