Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics platform that provides product teams with behavioral analytics, experimentation capabilities, and user engagement insights. The platform centers around event-based data collection and analysis, enabling organizations to track user interactions, measure product performance, and optimize user experiences through data-driven decision making.

## Core Product Architecture and Features

Amplitude's analytics platform is built on an event-based architecture that captures user interactions as discrete events with associated properties. The system supports multiple data ingestion methods including SDKs for mobile (iOS, Android) and web platforms, server-side APIs (HTTP V2 API, Batch Event Upload API), and third-party integrations like Segment. The platform maintains immutable data storage with pre-aggregated hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly datasets to ensure consistent reporting and historical data integrity.

The platform offers several key analytical chart types: Event Segmentation for measuring user actions and behaviors, Funnel Analysis for conversion tracking, Retention Analysis for user engagement measurement, User Composition for demographic analysis, Data Tables for multi-dimensional analysis, and Personas for behavioral clustering using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithms.

## Experimentation and Testing Capabilities

Amplitude Experiment provides A/B testing functionality with advanced statistical methodologies. The platform supports both sequential testing (with always-valid p-values) and traditional T-test approaches, offering features like mutual exclusion groups to prevent users from being assigned to multiple experiments simultaneously. The system calculates duration estimates using statistical significance thresholds, means, variances, and exposure data, with a 40-day estimation cap.

## Data Management and Governance

Amplitude Data serves as the governance layer, implementing tracking plans that manage event and property schemas. The system enforces instrumentation limits of 2000 event types, 2000 event properties, and 1000 user properties per project. Data governance includes the ability to hide, block, or delete events and properties, with blocking preventing data ingestion while hiding only affects UI visibility.

The platform includes sophisticated user identity management through Device IDs, User IDs, and Amplitude IDs, with automatic user profile merging capabilities. Session tracking varies by platform, with mobile SDKs using 30-second/30-event batching thresholds and configurable timeout windows.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Monthly Tracked Users (MTUs)**: The primary billing metric representing unique users who perform at least one event in a calendar month, with a standard limit of 1,000 events per MTU.

**Behavioral Cohorts**: Dynamic or static user groups based on behavioral criteria, exportable via the Behavioral Cohorts API with propKeys parameters for detailed user property inclusion.

**Channel Classifier**: A feature for defining acquisition channels using utm_medium and referring_domain properties to track traffic sources, available to Growth/Enterprise users with org admin/manager permissions.

**Transformations**: Event and property merging capabilities that allow retroactive data schema modifications while maintaining chart compatibility through Find & Replace functionality.

**Attribution API**: Mobile attribution system with a 72-hour mapping window for IDFA/IDFV/ADID identifiers, requiring pre-existing users with matching advertising IDs.

## Integration Ecosystem

Amplitude integrates extensively with third-party platforms including marketing attribution providers (Appsflyer, Adjust, Branch, Singular), website builders (Wix, Squarespace), and data pipeline tools like Segment. The platform supports proxy server configurations to handle browser tracking protection (particularly Firefox) and offers webhook integrations for custom implementations.

For data export, the platform provides the Export API for JSON format exports and Amazon S3 Export integration for bulk data transfers. CSV exports have varying limits: Event Segmentation and Retention Analysis support 300 group-by values, while Data Tables support up to 10,000 baseline limits.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

Key API endpoints include:
- **HTTP V2 API**: Real-time event ingestion with 30 events/second throttling limits
- **Batch Event Upload API**: Bulk data processing for backfills and high-volume scenarios
- **Export API**: Raw event data extraction in JSON format
- **Behavioral Cohorts API**: Cohort management and export functionality
- **Identity API**: User profile management and property updates
- **Attribution API**: Mobile attribution event processing

## Plan Structure and Compliance

Amplitude offers multiple plan tiers: Starter (free), Plus, Growth, and Enterprise, each with different MTU limits and feature availability. The Startup Scholarship plan provides qualifying startups (less than $10M funding, fewer than 20 employees) with one year of free Growth plan access including 200,000 MTUs.

The platform maintains comprehensive security and privacy compliance including SOC2 Type 2, GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA standards, with Data Processing Addendum (DPA) availability and Customer Trust Portal access for enterprise customers.
