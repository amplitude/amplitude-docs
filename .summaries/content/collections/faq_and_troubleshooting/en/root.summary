# Amplitude Analytics Platform: Comprehensive Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude is a digital analytics platform that helps organizations understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive business growth through data-driven insights. The platform enables teams to track, analyze, and visualize user interactions across digital products, allowing for informed decision-making based on actual user behavior.

### Key Features

1. **Event Tracking and Analysis**: Capture user interactions as events with associated properties across web and mobile applications.
2. **Behavioral Cohorts**: Create and analyze user segments based on specific behaviors and properties.
3. **Funnel Analysis**: Track user conversion through predefined sequences of events.
4. **Retention Analysis**: Measure how users continue to engage with products over time.
5. **Experiment Analysis**: Evaluate A/B tests using sequential testing and statistical significance calculations.
6. **User Composition**: Analyze user demographics and characteristics.
7. **Data Export and Integration**: Connect with other platforms and export data for further analysis.
8. **Personas**: Identify user clusters based on behavioral patterns using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization.

### Use Cases

- Product analytics and optimization
- User behavior tracking and segmentation
- Conversion funnel optimization
- A/B testing and experimentation
- User retention analysis
- Mobile attribution tracking
- Data-driven decision making

## Product Relationships and Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Data Collection Layer**:
   - JavaScript SDK for web applications
   - Mobile SDKs for iOS and Android
   - HTTP V2 API for real-time, low-volume data (30 events/second limit)
   - Batch Event Upload API for high-volume data transfers and backfills
   - Integrations with third-party platforms like Segment

2. **Data Processing Layer**:
   - Event ingestion and processing pipeline
   - User profile management and identity resolution
   - Data transformation capabilities (event/property merging)

3. **Analytics Layer**:
   - Chart visualization tools (Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, etc.)
   - Behavioral Cohort creation and management
   - Experiment analysis tools

4. **Data Export Layer**:
   - Export API for JSON-formatted data
   - Query Add-on for SQL-like queries in Snowflake
   - Amazon S3 Export for transferring event data

### Amplitude Experiment

Amplitude Experiment is an integrated feature that allows for A/B testing and experimentation, with capabilities including:
- Sequential testing for statistical validity
- Mutual exclusion groups to prevent users from participating in multiple experiments
- Duration estimates for experiment planning
- Integration with the core analytics platform for result analysis

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Events**: User actions or interactions tracked in Amplitude (e.g., page views, button clicks, purchases).

2. **Properties**:
   - **Event Properties**: Attributes associated with specific events (limited to 2000 per project).
   - **User Properties**: Attributes associated with users (limited to 1000 per project).
   - **Group Properties**: Attributes associated with groups of users.

3. **Device ID**: Unique identifier for a device, typically using IDFV (Identifier for Vendor) on iOS.

4. **User ID**: Custom identifier assigned to logged-in users.

5. **Amplitude ID**: Internal identifier used to track users across sessions and devices.

6. **Sessions**: Series of user interactions grouped together, typically defined by a 30-minute inactivity timeout.

7. **Behavioral Cohorts**: User segments defined by specific behaviors or properties.

8. **Instrumentation Limits**:
   - 2000 event types per project
   - 2000 event properties per project
   - 1000 user properties per project
   - 1024 characters for string values

9. **MTU (Monthly Tracked Users)**: The count of unique users tracked in a month, used for billing purposes.

10. **Statistical Significance**: Determination of whether experiment results are statistically valid, calculated using either two-tailed T-tests (Funnel Analysis) or sequential testing (Experiment Results).

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates with various components of the digital product stack:

1. **Data Sources**:
   - Direct SDK implementations (JavaScript, iOS, Android)
   - Server-side implementations
   - Third-party site builders (Wix, Squarespace)
   - Data integration platforms like Segment

2. **Data Destinations**:
   - Data warehouses via Amazon S3 Export
   - Business intelligence tools via Export API
   - Custom applications via Cohort API

3. **Marketing and Attribution**:
   - Mobile attribution partners (tracking installs and campaigns)
   - Channel classification for acquisition source tracking

4. **Authentication Systems**:
   - SSO integration with identity providers
   - Google Workspace integration

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

### Key API Endpoints

1. **HTTP V2 API**: `https://api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`
   - Used for real-time event tracking
   - Limited to 30 events per second

2. **Batch Event Upload API**: `https://api2.amplitude.com/batch`
   - Used for high-volume data transfers and backfills
   - Supports larger payloads

3. **Export API**: `https://amplitude.com/api/2/export`
   - Retrieves raw event data in JSON format

4. **Identify API**: `https://api2.amplitude.com/identify`
   - Sets or updates user properties

5. **Behavioral Cohort API**: Used to programmatically create and manage cohorts

### SDK Implementation

JavaScript SDK implementation example:
```javascript
amplitude.getInstance().init("API_KEY");
amplitude.getInstance().logEvent("EVENT_TYPE", {
  eventProperty1: "value1",
  eventProperty2: "value2"
});
```

### Data Governance Controls

1. **Hiding Events/Properties**: Makes them invisible in dropdowns but continues collecting data.
2. **Blocking Events/Properties**: Stops collecting new data while preserving historical data.
3. **Deleting Events/Properties**: Completely removes from ingestion and dropdowns.

## Plan Tiers and Limitations

1. **Free Plan**: Basic analytics capabilities with limited features.
2. **Plus Plan**: Enhanced features with MTU guardrails and a 1000 events per MTU limit.
3. **Growth Plan**: Advanced features including Behavioral Cohorts and Pathfinder.
4. **Enterprise Plan**: Full feature set with advanced security and support.
5. **Startup Scholarship Plan**: One year of free access to Growth plan features for qualifying startups.

Each plan has specific event volume limits, and exceeding these limits may result in overage fees or account restrictions.
