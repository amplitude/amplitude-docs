Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics platform that provides product teams with behavioral analytics, experimentation capabilities, and user engagement insights. The platform centers around event-based analytics, tracking user interactions across web and mobile applications to help organizations understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven decision making.

## Core Product Architecture and Features

Amplitude's analytics platform is built on an event-based architecture that ingests user interactions through multiple SDKs (JavaScript, iOS, Android) and APIs (HTTP V2 API, Batch Event Upload API). The platform processes this data into pre-aggregated hourly, daily, weekly, and monthly datasets that power various analytical charts and reports. Key analytical capabilities include Event Segmentation for tracking user actions, Funnel Analysis for conversion optimization, Retention Analysis for user engagement measurement, and Behavioral Cohorts for user segmentation.

The platform includes Amplitude Experiment for A/B testing and feature experimentation, utilizing advanced statistical methods like sequential testing and mutual exclusion groups. Amplitude Data provides governance capabilities through tracking plans that manage event and property schemas, while supporting data transformations for event and property merging.

## Chart Types and Analytical Capabilities

**Event Segmentation Charts** serve as the foundation for behavioral analysis, supporting custom formulas (ROLLWIN, PROP()), group-by filtering, and metrics like Active % and New User calculations. These charts can export up to 10,000 rows via CSV and support various counting methods including UNIQUES functions and rolling window calculations.

**Funnel Analysis Charts** track user conversion through multi-step processes, offering different counting methods (unique users vs event totals), conversion windows (24-hour vs calendar dates), and ordering options (This Order, Any Order, Exact Order). The charts support revenue attribution, time-to-convert calculations, and the Holding Property Constant feature for advanced analysis.

**Retention Analysis Charts** calculate user return behavior using weighted average calculations, supporting "Return On" vs "Return On or After" retention types. These charts handle incomplete data periods with asterisked indicators and support custom bracket configurations.

**Data Tables Charts** provide multi-dimensional analysis with group-by clause aggregation, though they have specific limitations around unique metric sum discrepancies and CSV export limits of 10,000 groups per metric.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Monthly Tracked Users (MTUs)** represent the core billing metric, with various plan tiers (Free, Plus, Growth, Enterprise) offering different MTU quotas and overage fee structures. The **instrumentation limit** caps projects at 2000 event types, 2000 event properties, and 1000 user properties per project.

**Device IDs** vary by platform - Android uses UUID, iOS uses IDFV/IDFA, while server-side events require manual configuration. **Session IDs** follow platform-specific timeout rules (30 minutes for web, 5 minutes for mobile) and can be customized through SDK configuration parameters like `flushIntervalMillis`, `flushQueueSize`, `eventUploadPeriodSeconds`, and `eventUploadThreshold`.

**User Properties** vs **Event Properties** represent different data storage models - user properties are stored separately and reflect current values, while event properties are stored with each event and reflect historical values at event time. The **(none)** bucket appears in charts when properties have null values due to instrumentation timing or missing data.

## Data Ingestion and API Endpoints

The **HTTP V2 API** handles real-time streaming with throttling limits of 30 events per second, while the **Batch Event Upload API** supports bulk data processing for backfills and migrations. The **Export API** provides JSON format data export capabilities, complemented by **Amazon S3 Export integration** for bulk data export to S3 buckets.

The **Attribution API** handles mobile attribution events with a 72-hour mapping window for IDFA/IDFV/ADID identifiers. The **Identify API** manages user property updates, while the **Behavioral Cohorts API** enables programmatic cohort management with `props` and `propKeys` parameters.

## Statistical Analysis and Experimentation

Amplitude Experiment employs **sequential testing** methodology with specific statistical thresholds (25 conversions + 100 exposures for uniques, 100 exposures for totals). This approach provides always-valid p-values and controlled Type 1 error rates compared to traditional T-tests. **Mutual exclusion groups** prevent users from being assigned to multiple experiments simultaneously through slot allocation percentages.

The platform calculates **statistical significance** using improvement over baseline ratios, supporting both unique conversions and totals with minimum sample size requirements (30 samples threshold, five conversions minimum). **Duration estimates** predict experiment completion time using means, variances, and exposures with a 40-day cap.

## Data Governance and Privacy

**Amplitude Data** provides tracking plan governance with the ability to hide, block, or delete events and properties. The platform maintains **immutable data architecture** - once ingested, data cannot be modified, though workarounds exist using Export API + Batch API workflows for data cleaning.

Privacy compliance includes **SOC2 Type 2**, **GDPR**, **HIPAA**, and **CCPA** standards, with features like the **User Privacy API** for GDPR compliance and **Data Processing Addendum (DPA)** for enterprise customers. **Data Filters** enable IP address blocking and internal user filtering to maintain data quality.

## Integration Ecosystem

The platform integrates with third-party tools through **Segment-Amplitude integration** supporting both cloud-mode and device-mode connections. For website builders like **Wix** and **Squarespace**, implementation uses platform-specific features like Tracking Tools & Analytics and Code Injection capabilities.

**iOS 14 IDFA opt-in requirements** affect device identification and attribution matching, with specific guidance on IDFA vs IDFV usage impacts. The platform handles **Firefox tracking protection** through proxy server solutions when standard SDK requests are blocked.

## Command Line and Configuration

Key SDK configuration parameters include:
- `flushIntervalMillis` and `flushQueueSize` for Android Kotlin SDK
- `eventUploadPeriodSeconds` and `eventUploadThreshold` for iOS SDK
- Session timeout configurations (30-minute web timeout, 5-minute mobile timeout)
- **Channel classifier** configuration using `utm_medium` and `referring_domain` properties

The platform supports various export limits: 10,000 rows for Event Segmentation and Data Tables, 300 rows for Funnel Analysis, and 1 million rows for Microscope downloads, with specific CSV export capabilities varying by chart type and analysis requirements.
