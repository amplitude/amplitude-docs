# Amplitude Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics platform that helps organizations understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive business growth through data-driven insights. The platform enables teams to track, analyze, and act on user interactions across digital products and services.

Key features of Amplitude include:

1. **Event-based Analytics**: Track user actions and behaviors through events and properties
2. **User Segmentation**: Create and analyze behavioral cohorts based on user actions
3. **Funnel Analysis**: Measure conversion rates through multi-step user journeys
4. **Retention Analysis**: Understand user engagement and stickiness over time
5. **Experimentation**: Run A/B tests with statistical rigor through sequential testing
6. **Data Management**: Control data governance, transformations, and integrations

## Product Relationships and Architecture

Amplitude's product ecosystem consists of several interconnected components:

1. **Data Collection Layer**:
   - SDKs for various platforms (JavaScript, iOS, Android)
   - HTTP APIs (V2 API for real-time data, Batch Event Upload API for high-volume transfers)
   - Third-party integrations (Segment, etc.)

2. **Data Processing Layer**:
   - Event ingestion and processing
   - User profile management and identity resolution
   - Data transformations (event/property merging)

3. **Analytics Layer**:
   - Chart types (Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, etc.)
   - Behavioral Cohorts
   - User Composition and Personas

4. **Experimentation Layer**:
   - Experiment design and targeting
   - Sequential testing for statistical significance
   - Mutual exclusion groups

5. **Data Export Layer**:
   - Export API
   - Amazon S3 Export
   - Query Add-on (Amplitude SQL/Snowflake ETL)

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Events**: User actions tracked in Amplitude (limited to 2000 event types per project)
2. **Properties**:
   - **Event Properties**: Attributes of specific events (limited to 2000 per project)
   - **User Properties**: Attributes of users that persist across events (limited to 1000 per project)
   - **Group Properties**: Attributes of organizational groups

3. **Identifiers**:
   - **User ID**: Custom identifier for logged-in users
   - **Device ID**: Identifier for devices (IDFV on iOS by default)
   - **Amplitude ID**: Amplitude's internal user identifier

4. **Sessions**: Series of user events grouped by time proximity (default 30-minute timeout)

5. **Cohorts**: Groups of users defined by behavioral criteria or uploaded lists

6. **MTU (Monthly Tracked Users)**: Unique users tracked per month, a key billing metric

7. **Statistical Metrics**:
   - **Sequential Testing**: Statistical method allowing continuous monitoring of experiment results
   - **T-test**: Traditional statistical significance test used in Funnel Analysis

8. **Data Governance Terms**:
   - **Hidden Events/Properties**: Still collected but not visible in dropdowns
   - **Blocked Events/Properties**: No longer collected but historical data preserved
   - **Deleted Events/Properties**: Completely removed from ingestion and dropdowns

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementations

1. **HTTP V2 API**: `https://api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`
   - Real-time event tracking
   - Limited to 30 events/second
   - Example: `POST https://api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`

2. **Batch Event Upload API**: `https://api2.amplitude.com/batch`
   - High-volume data transfers
   - Used for backfills and migrations
   - Example: `POST https://api2.amplitude.com/batch`

3. **Identify API**: Used to update user properties without sending events
   - Example: `POST https://api2.amplitude.com/identify`

4. **Export API**: For exporting raw event data in JSON format
   - Example: `GET https://amplitude.com/api/2/export`

5. **Cohort API**: For managing and exporting behavioral cohorts
   - Example: `GET https://amplitude.com/api/3/cohorts`

6. **SDK Implementation Examples**:
   ```javascript
   // JavaScript SDK initialization
   amplitude.getInstance().init("API_KEY", null, {
     flushIntervalMillis: 1000,
     eventUploadThreshold: 30
   });
   
   // Tracking an event
   amplitude.getInstance().logEvent("Event Name", {
     property1: "value1",
     property2: "value2"
   });
   ```

## Troubleshooting and Limitations

1. **Data Limits**:
   - 2000 event types per project
   - 2000 event properties per project
   - 1000 user properties per project
   - 1024 character limit for string values
   - Chart-specific export limits (300-10,000 rows depending on chart type)

2. **Common Issues**:
   - Missing data due to instrumentation limits or ingestion delays
   - User count fluctuations due to delayed events or user merging
   - Authentication problems with SSO configurations
   - Data discrepancies with other platforms due to different tracking methodologies
   - Firefox tracking protection blocking Amplitude SDK

3. **Data Immutability**:
   - Historical data cannot be directly modified due to pre-aggregated data architecture
   - Workarounds include self-service data deletion, export/clean/re-upload, and user property updates

Amplitude offers various subscription tiers including Free, Plus, Growth, and Enterprise plans, with features like Behavioral Cohorts, Pathfinder, and advanced collaboration tools available in higher tiers. The platform also provides a Startup Scholarship plan for qualifying startups.
