Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics platform that provides product teams with behavioral analytics, experimentation capabilities, and user engagement insights. The platform centers around event-based data collection and analysis, enabling organizations to track user interactions, measure product performance, and optimize user experiences through data-driven decision making.

## Core Product Architecture

Amplitude's ecosystem consists of several interconnected products:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the primary analytics engine, featuring multiple chart types for different analytical needs:
- Event Segmentation charts for tracking user actions and behaviors over time
- Funnel Analysis for conversion tracking and optimization
- Retention Analysis for measuring user engagement and churn
- User Composition charts for demographic and property-based analysis
- Data Tables for multi-dimensional data exploration
- Personas charts for behavioral clustering using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)

**Amplitude Experiment** provides A/B testing and feature flagging capabilities with advanced statistical methodologies including sequential testing and mutual exclusion groups for preventing cross-experiment contamination.

**Amplitude Data** manages data governance through tracking plans, event/property management, and data quality controls including the ability to hide, block, or delete events and properties.

## Key Technical Concepts and Nomenclature

**Data Ingestion and Identity Management:**
- Events are the fundamental unit of data, representing user actions with associated properties
- User identification operates through multiple ID types: User ID, Device ID, and Amplitude ID
- Device ID generation varies by platform (Android UUID, iOS IDFV/IDFA)
- Session tracking uses configurable timeout windows (30 minutes web, 5 minutes mobile)

**Data Architecture:**
- Immutable data model with pre-aggregated hourly/daily/weekly/monthly datasets
- Monthly Tracked Users (MTU) as the primary billing metric
- Instrumentation limits: 2000 event types, 2000 event properties, 1000 user properties per project
- Monthly event volume limits with overage policies

**Statistical Methods:**
- Sequential testing in Amplitude Experiment provides always-valid p-values without peeking penalties
- T-test methodology in Funnel Analysis for conversion comparison
- Minimum thresholds: 25 conversions + 100 exposures for statistical significance

## Data Integration and APIs

**Primary Integration Methods:**
- JavaScript SDK for web applications with proxy server support for Firefox tracking protection
- Mobile SDKs (iOS, Android) with configurable batching thresholds
- HTTP V2 API for real-time data ingestion (30 events/second throttling limit)
- Batch Event Upload API for bulk data processing
- Attribution API for mobile attribution with 72-hour mapping windows

**Data Export Capabilities:**
- Export API for raw event data in JSON format
- Amazon S3 Export integration for bulk data warehousing
- CSV exports with chart-specific row limits (typically 10,000 rows)
- Behavioral Cohorts API for user segment management

**Third-Party Integrations:**
- Segment integration supporting both cloud-mode and device-mode connections
- Support for third-party website builders (Wix, Squarespace) through code injection
- Attribution partner integrations (Appsflyer, Adjust, Branch, Singular)

## Advanced Features and Functionality

**Behavioral Cohorts** enable dynamic and static user segmentation with CSV upload capabilities and API-based management. The system supports complex filtering including "didn't" clauses for negative event filtering and "most recently" clauses for user property grouping.

**Channel Classifier** provides acquisition channel tracking using UTM parameters and referring domains with retroactive application capabilities.

**Transformations** allow event and property merging with retroactive application, supporting bulk chart updates through Find & Replace functionality.

**Data Filtering** includes IP address blocking, internal user filtering, and bot traffic prevention through various segmentation methods.

## Plan Structure and Limitations

Amplitude offers tiered pricing plans:
- **Starter/Free Plan**: Basic analytics with limited MTU
- **Plus Plan**: Enhanced features with 1.2x overage pricing and MTU guardrails (1,000 events per MTU)
- **Growth Plan**: Advanced features including Behavioral Cohorts, Pathfinder, SSO
- **Enterprise Plan**: Full feature access with custom data retention and advanced security compliance

**Startup Scholarship Plan** provides qualifying startups (under $10M funding, fewer than 20 employees) with one year of free Growth plan access including 200,000 MTUs.

## Security and Compliance

Amplitude maintains enterprise-grade security standards including SOC2 Type 2, GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA compliance. The platform provides Data Processing Addendum (DPA) support, Customer Trust Portal access, and operates a Bug Bounty program for vulnerability management.

The platform's data governance includes User Privacy API for GDPR compliance, immutable data architecture for audit trails, and comprehensive access controls through SSO integration for Growth and Enterprise plans.
