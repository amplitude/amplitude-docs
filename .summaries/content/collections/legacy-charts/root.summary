# Legacy Charts in Amplitude: Product Overview

Legacy Charts in Amplitude is a suite of visualization tools designed to help product teams understand user behavior, conversion paths, and navigation patterns within digital products. The suite includes three main components: Journeys, Pathfinder, and Pathfinder Users, each providing different perspectives on user flow analysis.

These legacy visualization tools enable teams to:
- Track user conversion paths between specific events
- Identify friction points in the user journey
- Analyze common navigation patterns
- Compare successful vs. unsuccessful user paths
- Understand event sequences that lead to desired outcomes
- Segment users based on their behavior patterns

## Product Relationships and Features

### Journeys
- Focuses on conversion paths between two specific funnel steps
- Limited to a 60-day timeframe analysis
- Provides step-by-step breakdowns of paths taken by both converted and dropped-off users
- Features TF-IDF auto-filter to identify significant patterns
- Allows comparison of conversion timeframes across different paths
- Enables cohort creation based on path analysis

### Pathfinder
- Visualizes user flows using Sankey diagrams
- Shows sequences of events (paths) users take during specified time periods
- Analyzes both incoming and outgoing paths
- Supports depth analysis up to fifty steps
- Helps identify common conversion paths for funnel analysis
- Includes "bucket below threshold" feature to manage visualization complexity

### Pathfinder Users
- Focuses on analyzing individual user navigation paths
- Shows events users take before or after a specified event
- Offers segmentation options for user groups
- Provides measurement by users or sessions
- Supports event expansion by properties for deeper analysis

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Sankey Diagram**: A flow visualization used in Pathfinder where the width of arrows is proportional to the flow quantity
- **Nodes**: Individual events or touchpoints in a user journey visualization
- **TF-IDF Auto-filter**: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency algorithm used in Journeys to automatically identify significant patterns
- **Bucket Below Threshold**: Feature in Pathfinder that groups less common paths together to simplify visualization
- **Event Expansion by Properties**: Capability to break down events by their properties for more detailed analysis
- **Session Tracking**: Analysis method that groups user actions within a single visit or session
- **Conversion Paths**: Sequences of events that lead to a desired outcome
- **Drop-off Analysis**: Examination of where users abandon a process

## Product Ecosystem Integration

These legacy charts are part of Amplitude's analytics platform and are available on Plus, Growth, and Enterprise plans. They complement other Amplitude features by:

- Providing input for funnel analysis by identifying common conversion paths
- Enabling cohort creation based on path analysis for further targeting
- Supporting cross-feature analysis when used alongside other Amplitude tools
- Offering visualization alternatives to newer chart types in the platform

The "legacy" designation suggests these charts represent earlier visualization methods in Amplitude's product evolution, though they remain valuable for specific analysis use cases.

## Usage Notes

These charts are accessed through Amplitude's web interface. Users should choose the appropriate tool based on their specific analysis needs, with Journeys focusing on conversion between specific steps and Pathfinder providing broader flow visualization. Pathfinder Users offers flexibility in analyzing behavior by either users or sessions.
