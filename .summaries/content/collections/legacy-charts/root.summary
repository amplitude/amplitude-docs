# Legacy Charts in Amplitude

## Overview
Amplitude's Legacy Charts suite provides advanced analytics tools for understanding user behavior through path analysis and journey visualization. The suite includes Pathfinder, Pathfinder Users, and Journeys, which are being consolidated into a new unified Journeys experience. These tools help product teams visualize user navigation patterns, identify conversion paths, understand drop-off points, and optimize the overall user experience.

## Key Features

### Pathfinder
- Visualizes user flows as sequences of events (paths) using Sankey diagrams
- Analyzes both incoming and outgoing paths to specific events
- Supports path analysis up to fifty steps deep
- Helps identify common conversion paths for funnel analysis
- Includes path filtering options and "bucket below threshold" functionality to group less common paths

### Pathfinder Users
- Focuses on individual user navigation paths within sessions
- Shows events users take before or after a specified event
- Displays results in descending order of usage frequency
- Uses session_id to track user movement
- Supports "expand by property" functionality
- Limited to analyzing paths within individual sessions

### Legacy Journeys
- Analyzes user conversion paths between two funnel steps
- Provides 60-day timeframe analysis
- Shows step-by-step breakdowns of paths taken by converted and dropped-off users
- Identifies friction points and conversion accelerators
- Features TF-IDF auto-filter to highlight statistically significant patterns
- Enables path comparison and cohort creation
- Supports event filtering for detailed analysis

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The three tools in the Legacy Charts suite offer complementary functionality that together provide comprehensive path analysis capabilities:

- **Pathfinder** focuses on aggregate event flows and high-level path visualization
- **Pathfinder Users** emphasizes individual user paths within sessions
- **Legacy Journeys** specializes in conversion path analysis between funnel steps

These tools are being consolidated into a new, unified Journeys experience, indicating Amplitude's strategic direction toward integrated path analysis capabilities.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Paths**: Sequences of events that users take when navigating through a product
- **Sankey Diagram**: Visualization type showing flow quantities between nodes
- **Session_id**: Identifier tracking user activity within a single session
- **TF-IDF Auto-filter**: Algorithm that automatically highlights statistically significant patterns in user journeys
- **Conversion Paths**: Routes users take that lead to successful completion of desired actions
- **Drop-off Analysis**: Examination of where and why users abandon a process
- **Node Paths**: Visual representation of connections between events in a user journey
- **Bucket Below Threshold**: Feature grouping less common paths together for cleaner visualization

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Legacy Charts suite integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem as specialized tools for path analysis and user journey mapping. These charts complement other Amplitude features:

- **Funnel Analysis**: Legacy Journeys enhances funnel analysis by showing paths between funnel steps
- **Cohort Creation**: Insights from path analysis can be used to create targeted user cohorts
- **User Segmentation**: Path data helps identify different user behavior patterns for segmentation

## Availability

- Available on Plus, Growth, and Enterprise plans
- Accessible as legacy features within the Amplitude platform
- Being merged into the new Journeys experience
