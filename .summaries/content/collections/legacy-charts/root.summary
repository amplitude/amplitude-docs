# Legacy Charts in Amplitude: Product Overview

## Product Overview

Legacy Charts in Amplitude are visualization tools designed to help product teams analyze user behavior and navigation patterns within applications. These charts focus on understanding user journeys, conversion paths, and event sequences to identify friction points, optimize user flows, and improve product experiences. The suite includes Journeys and Pathfinder (with its Pathfinder Users variant), each offering different approaches to visualizing and analyzing user behavior data.

## Product Relationships and Features

### Journeys
- Analyzes user conversion paths between two specific funnel steps
- Limited to 60-day timeframe analysis
- Provides detailed breakdowns of paths taken by both converted and dropped-off users
- Identifies friction points in the user experience
- Shows which experiences lead to faster or slower conversions
- Includes TF-IDF auto-filter to highlight statistically significant paths
- Available on Plus, Growth, and Enterprise plans

### Pathfinder
- Visualizes user flows as a Sankey diagram
- Displays sequences of events (paths) users take during specified sessions
- Analyzes both incoming and outgoing paths up to fifty steps deep
- Identifies common conversion paths for funnel analysis
- Uses session-based analysis with event nodes representing user actions
- Features "bucket below threshold" functionality to group less common paths

### Pathfinder Users
- Variant of Pathfinder focused on user navigation paths
- Shows most common sequences of events before or after a specified event
- Offers user segmentation for targeted analysis
- Allows measurement by users or sessions based on analysis needs
- Supports expansion of events by properties for deeper analysis
- Requires session_id for session-based tracking

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Conversion paths**: Sequential steps users take between two funnel points
- **Drop-off analysis**: Examination of where and why users abandon a process
- **TF-IDF auto-filter**: Statistical method highlighting significant paths by comparing frequency against expected occurrence
- **Sankey diagram**: Flow visualization where arrow width represents flow quantity
- **Event nodes**: Visual representations of user actions in path analysis
- **Path sequences**: Ordered series of events performed by users
- **Session-based analysis**: Analysis limited to user activity within a single session
- **Bucket below threshold**: Feature grouping less common paths for cleaner visualization
- **Event expansion by property**: Breakdown of events by properties for detailed analysis

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Legacy Charts are integrated within Amplitude's analytics platform, specifically for user behavior analysis. These tools complement other Amplitude features by providing specialized path analysis visualizations. The "legacy" designation suggests these charts may have been superseded by newer tools in the Amplitude ecosystem, though they remain available on specific plans.

The documentation compares "Journeys vs Pathfinder," indicating they serve similar but distinct analytical purposes. Journeys focuses on conversion analysis between specific funnel steps, while Pathfinder offers broader path visualization capabilities.

These charts integrate with Amplitude's cohort creation functionality, allowing users to create segments based on discovered paths.

## Technical Implementation

The documentation doesn't specify API endpoints or command line invocations. However, it notes technical requirements including:
- Session_id requirement for session-based tracking in Pathfinder Users
- Limitations on custom events in Pathfinder
- Plan-specific availability (Plus/Growth/Enterprise plans for Journeys)

These tools appear to be primarily accessed through Amplitude's web interface rather than through direct API calls.
