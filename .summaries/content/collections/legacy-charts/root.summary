# Legacy Charts in Amplitude

## Product Overview

Legacy Charts in Amplitude provides visualization tools for analyzing user behavior and conversion paths within applications. The suite consists of two main components: Pathfinder and Journeys, which help product teams understand how users navigate through their applications and identify key conversion paths between events. These tools enable teams to discover friction points, conversion accelerators, and common user behaviors through visual representations of event sequences.

## Relationship Between Products and Features

The Legacy Charts suite contains two primary products with distinct but complementary functionality:

1. **Pathfinder** - Visualizes user flows as sequences of events (paths) and comes in two variants:
   - **Pathfinder Chart**: Shows general user flows across specified time periods, analyzing up to fifty steps deep in a user journey. It can display both incoming and outgoing paths to specific events.
   - **Pathfinder Users Chart**: Focuses on individual user navigation paths, showing events users take before or after a specified event. Results are displayed in descending order of usage frequency, and paths can be limited to individual sessions when session_id is available.

2. **Journeys** - A more specialized tool that analyzes user conversion paths between two specific funnel steps within a 60-day timeframe. It provides:
   - Step-by-step breakdowns of paths taken by both converted and dropped-off users
   - Identification of friction points and conversion accelerators
   - Auto-filtering using TF-IDF heuristic to highlight statistically significant paths
   - Path exploration capabilities for analyzing user behavior patterns

These legacy charts are being phased out and merged into a new, unified Journeys experience, though they remain available for existing users during the transition period.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Paths**: Sequences of events that users perform in a product
- **Nodes**: Individual events within a path visualization
- **Sankey Diagram**: The flow diagram visualization used in Pathfinder
- **TF-IDF heuristic**: An algorithm used in Journeys for auto-filtering to identify statistically significant paths
- **Conversion paths**: Event sequences that lead to successful completion of a desired action
- **Drop-off analysis**: Examination of paths where users abandon a process
- **Session-based paths**: User journeys limited to a single session (requires session_id)
- **Bucket below threshold**: A grouping mechanism for less common paths
- **Path frequency**: How often a particular sequence of events occurs

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Legacy Charts are part of Amplitude's analytics platform and are available to users on Plus, Growth, and Enterprise plans. The charts integrate with Amplitude's broader event tracking and analytics capabilities:

- They rely on properly tracked and time-ordered event data within the Amplitude platform
- They complement other Amplitude analytics tools by providing visual path analysis
- The legacy charts are being consolidated into a new, unified Journeys experience that maintains core functionality while likely offering enhanced capabilities
- They support custom events that can be incorporated into path analysis
- The system allows filtering out "noisy events" to improve visualization clarity

## Technical Implementation

The Legacy Charts have specific technical parameters:

- Path analysis can extend up to fifty steps deep
- Journeys analysis is limited to a 60-day timeframe
- Session-based analysis in Pathfinder Users requires session_id implementation
- Visualizations are primarily presented through Sankey diagrams and other flow-based visualizations
- The system supports filtering mechanisms to focus on relevant paths and exclude noise
- Auto-filtering capabilities using TF-IDF heuristic help highlight statistically significant paths

While specific API endpoints are not detailed in the documentation, these visualization tools are accessed through the Amplitude analytics platform interface and rely on properly instrumented event data.
