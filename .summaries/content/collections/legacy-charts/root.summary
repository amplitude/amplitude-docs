# Legacy Charts in Amplitude: Product Overview

Legacy Charts in Amplitude provides visualization tools for analyzing user behavior and navigation patterns within applications. The suite consists of three main components: Pathfinder, Pathfinder Users, and Journeys.

## Key Features and Use Cases

- Track user navigation through products
- Identify common conversion and drop-off paths
- Analyze user behavior patterns before and after key events
- Discover friction points in the user experience
- Compare navigation patterns across different user segments
- Understand the time dimension of user conversions

## Product Relationships and Features

### Pathfinder
- Visualizes user flows as a Sankey diagram
- Shows sequences of events during specified time periods
- Analyzes both incoming paths (events leading to a target) and outgoing paths (events following a target)
- Supports path analysis up to fifty steps deep
- Includes "Bucket below threshold" feature to group less common paths
- Offers filtering capabilities to remove noisy events
- Provides session-based tracking options

### Pathfinder Users
- User-centric version of Pathfinder
- Visualizes common event sequences before or after a specified event
- Allows measurement by users or sessions
- Supports user segmentation for comparative analysis
- Enables event expansion by properties
- Focuses on navigation analysis and user journey mapping

### Journeys
- Specialized for understanding conversion paths between two funnel steps
- Limited to 60-day timeframe analysis
- Provides step-by-step breakdowns of paths for converted and dropped-off users
- Features TF-IDF auto-filter to highlight statistically significant paths
- Identifies friction points in conversion processes
- Shows which experiences lead to faster or slower conversions
- Supports path expansion by properties
- Enables cohort creation from path analysis

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Sankey Diagram**: Flow visualization format where arrow width represents user volume on a particular path
- **Nodes**: Individual events or touchpoints in the user journey visualization
- **Bucket Below Threshold**: Groups less common paths together to simplify visualization
- **TF-IDF Auto-filter**: Statistical method highlighting significant paths by comparing converted vs. dropped-off users
- **Conversion Timeframe**: Time period analyzed for user conversions (up to 60 days in Journeys)
- **Path Expansion by Properties**: Breaking down events by properties for detailed analysis
- **Microscope**: Feature in Pathfinder for detailed analysis
- **Incoming/Outgoing Paths**: Directional analysis of events leading to or following a target event

## Product Ecosystem Integration

- Legacy charts are part of Amplitude's analytics platform
- Journeys is available on Plus, Growth, and Enterprise plans
- Tools integrate with other Amplitude features, such as cohort creation
- Journeys complements Pathfinder, with each serving different analytical needs
- The "legacy" designation suggests these are older visualization tools that may have been superseded by newer features

These visualization tools are accessed through the Amplitude analytics interface, where users can configure charts by selecting target events, setting time periods, configuring visualization parameters, applying filters, and expanding events by properties.
