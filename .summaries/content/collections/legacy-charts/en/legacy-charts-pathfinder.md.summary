**Summary:** Pathfinder is a legacy Amplitude chart that visualizes aggregated user flows and event sequences within sessions using sankey diagrams and funnel visualizations, requiring session_id tracking and supporting up to 50 steps with configurable bucket thresholds. This legacy chart is being merged into the new Journeys experience and tracks event paths based on client_event_time timestamps with millisecond resolution.
