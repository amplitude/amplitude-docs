**Summary:** Pathfinder is a legacy Amplitude chart that visualizes aggregated user flows and event sequences within sessions using sankey diagrams and funnel visualizations, requiring session_id tracking and supporting up to 50 steps with "starting with" or "ending with" event analysis. This legacy chart is being merged into the new Journeys experience and tracks event paths based on client_event_time timestamps with configurable bucket thresholds and event filtering options.
