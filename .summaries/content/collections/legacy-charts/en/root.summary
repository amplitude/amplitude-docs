# Legacy Charts in Amplitude

## Product Overview

Legacy Charts in Amplitude is a suite of visualization tools designed to help product teams understand user behavior and conversion paths within their applications. The suite includes two primary components: Pathfinder and Journeys, which are focused on analyzing user navigation flows and conversion paths between events. These tools enable teams to identify friction points, conversion accelerators, and common user behaviors through visual representations of event sequences.

## Key Features and Components

### Pathfinder
Pathfinder is a visualization tool that displays user flows within a product as sequences of events (paths). It comes in two variants:

1. **Pathfinder Chart**: Visualizes general user flows showing sequences of events users take during specified time periods. It can analyze:
   - Up to fifty steps deep in a user journey
   - Both incoming and outgoing paths to specific events
   - Common conversion paths for funnel analysis

2. **Pathfinder Users Chart**: Focuses specifically on individual user navigation paths, showing:
   - Events users take before or after a specified event
   - Results displayed in descending order of usage frequency
   - Paths limited to individual sessions (requires session_id)

### Journeys
Journeys is a more advanced feature that helps teams understand user conversion paths between two specific funnel steps within a 60-day timeframe. It provides:
- Step-by-step breakdowns of paths taken by both converted and dropped-off users
- Identification of friction points and conversion accelerators
- Auto-filtering capabilities using TF-IDF heuristic to highlight significant paths
- Path exploration for analyzing user behavior patterns

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Paths**: Sequences of events that users perform in a product
- **Nodes**: Individual events within a path visualization
- **Sankey Diagram**: The flow diagram visualization used in Pathfinder
- **TF-IDF heuristic**: An algorithm used in Journeys for auto-filtering to identify statistically significant paths
- **Conversion paths**: Event sequences that lead to successful completion of a desired action
- **Drop-off analysis**: Examination of paths where users abandon a process
- **Session-based paths**: User journeys limited to a single session (requires session_id)
- **Bucket below threshold**: A grouping mechanism for less common paths
- **Path frequency**: How often a particular sequence of events occurs

## Product Ecosystem Integration

These legacy charts are part of Amplitude's analytics platform and are available to users on Plus, Growth, and Enterprise plans. The documentation indicates that these legacy charts are being phased out and merged into a new, unified Journeys experience. The relationship between the legacy and new components is as follows:

- Legacy Pathfinder and Pathfinder Users are being consolidated into the new Journeys feature
- The new Journeys experience appears to maintain the core functionality while likely offering enhanced capabilities
- The legacy charts remain available for existing users during the transition period

## Technical Implementation

While specific API endpoints are not detailed in the provided documentation, the charts require:

- Event data with proper time ordering
- Session identification (session_id) for session-based analysis in Pathfinder Users
- Custom events can be incorporated into path analysis
- The system supports filtering out "noisy events" to improve visualization clarity
- Path analysis can extend up to fifty steps deep
- Analysis is limited to a 60-day timeframe for Journeys

The legacy charts provide visualization capabilities through Sankey diagrams and other flow-based visualizations to represent user navigation patterns and conversion paths.
