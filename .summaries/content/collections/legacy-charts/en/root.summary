## Amplitude Legacy Charts Product Overview

The Legacy Charts collection represents deprecated Amplitude analytics features focused on user journey analysis and path visualization. These charts provide sophisticated user flow tracking capabilities through three main products: Legacy Journeys, Pathfinder, and Pathfinder Users. All legacy charts are being phased out in favor of newer Amplitude experiences, particularly the updated Journeys feature.

## Product Relationships and Feature Architecture

The three legacy chart types form a complementary ecosystem for user behavior analysis:

**Legacy Journeys** serves as the conversion-focused analytics tool, analyzing user paths between specific funnel steps within 60-day windows. It employs TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) auto-filtering heuristics to surface meaningful conversion and drop-off patterns.

**Pathfinder** provides aggregated session-based flow visualization using sankey diagrams and funnel representations, supporting up to 50 steps within 45-day timeframes. It focuses on overall user flow patterns across sessions.

**Pathfinder Users** offers granular, individual user journey tracking within sessions, supporting both forward ("starting with") and backward ("ending with") path analysis with 30-day maximum timeframes.

All three products integrate with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem through features like Microscope integration, cohort saving capabilities, and user segmentation tools.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Session-based Tracking**: Core requirement for Pathfinder products, necessitating session_id implementation for accurate path visualization and event sequence ordering via client_event_time.

**TF-IDF Auto-filter Heuristic**: Machine learning technique used in Legacy Journeys to automatically identify and surface the most statistically significant user paths while filtering out noise.

**Starting With/Ending With Events**: Directional path analysis modes allowing users to trace journeys forward from initial events or backward from terminal events.

**Nodes and Paths**: Fundamental visualization elements in Pathfinder charts where nodes represent events and paths show user flow transitions between events.

**Bucket Below Threshold**: Pathfinder feature that groups low-volume paths together to reduce visual complexity in sankey diagrams.

**User Stream Drilling**: Legacy Journeys capability enabling deep-dive analysis into individual user behaviors within broader conversion patterns.

**"In This Order" Funnel Requirement**: Specific sequencing constraint in Legacy Journeys ensuring events occur in predetermined sequences for accurate conversion analysis.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Legacy Charts integrate with Amplitude's analytics platform through several touchpoints:

- **Microscope Integration**: Enables detailed user behavior inspection from chart visualizations
- **Cohort Management**: Supports saving user segments identified through path analysis for further targeting and analysis
- **Event Property Expansion**: Allows drilling down into specific event attributes for enhanced segmentation
- **Signal Filtering**: Provides noise reduction through configurable filtering sliders and custom filter overrides
- **Plan Tier Access**: Features distributed across Plus, Growth, and Enterprise subscription tiers

The legacy charts require proper event instrumentation with session_id tracking for HTTP API implementations and support custom events with property-based expansion capabilities.

## Technical Implementation Requirements

**Session ID Tracking**: Critical for Pathfinder and Pathfinder Users functionality, requiring consistent session_id implementation across all tracked events.

**Event Ordering**: Utilizes client_event_time for accurate chronological sequence representation in path visualizations.

**Timeframe Limitations**: 
- Legacy Journeys: 60-day maximum analysis window
- Pathfinder: 45-day limit with 50-step maximum
- Pathfinder Users: 30-day maximum timeframe

**Hide Noisy Events**: Built-in filtering mechanism to reduce visual complexity by suppressing low-signal events from path visualizations.

These legacy features are being consolidated into Amplitude's modernized Journeys experience, representing the company's evolution toward more sophisticated user journey analytics capabilities.
