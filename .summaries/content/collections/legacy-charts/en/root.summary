# Legacy Charts in Amplitude: Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude's Legacy Charts are a suite of visualization tools designed to help product teams understand user behavior and navigation patterns within their applications. These charts focus on analyzing user journeys, conversion paths, and event sequences to identify friction points, optimize user flows, and improve product experiences. The legacy charts include Journeys and Pathfinder (with its variant, Pathfinder Users), which provide different approaches to visualizing and analyzing user behavior.

## Product Relationships and Features

### Journeys
- Focuses on understanding user conversion paths between two specific funnel steps
- Limited to a 60-day timeframe analysis
- Provides step-by-step breakdowns of paths taken by both converted and dropped-off users
- Helps identify friction points in the user experience
- Reveals which experiences lead to faster or slower conversions
- Features TF-IDF auto-filter to highlight statistically significant paths
- Available on Plus, Growth, and Enterprise plans

### Pathfinder
- Visualizes user flows within a product as a Sankey diagram
- Shows sequences of events (paths) users take during specified sessions
- Analyzes both incoming and outgoing paths up to fifty steps deep
- Helps identify common conversion paths for funnel analysis
- Session-based analysis with event nodes representing user actions
- Includes "bucket below threshold" feature to group less common paths

### Pathfinder Users
- A variant of Pathfinder that specifically visualizes user navigation paths
- Shows the most common sequences of events before or after a specified event
- Offers options to segment users for targeted analysis
- Can measure by users or sessions depending on analysis needs
- Allows expansion of events by properties for deeper analysis
- Requires session_id for session-based tracking

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Conversion paths**: The sequence of steps users take between two funnel points
- **Drop-off analysis**: Examining where and why users abandon a process
- **TF-IDF auto-filter**: A statistical method that highlights significant paths by comparing their frequency against expected occurrence
- **Sankey diagram**: A flow visualization where the width of arrows is proportional to the flow quantity
- **Event nodes**: Visual representations of user actions in path analysis
- **Path sequences**: Ordered series of events that users perform
- **Session-based analysis**: Analysis confined to user activity within a single session
- **Bucket below threshold**: A feature that groups less common paths together for cleaner visualization
- **Event expansion by property**: Breaking down events by their properties for more detailed analysis

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Legacy Charts are part of Amplitude's broader analytics platform, specifically designed for user behavior analysis. These tools complement other Amplitude features by providing specialized visualizations for path analysis. The documentation indicates that Journeys and Pathfinder are considered "legacy" features, suggesting they may have been superseded by newer tools in the Amplitude ecosystem, though they remain available for users on specific plans.

The documentation specifically mentions a comparison between "Journeys vs Pathfinder," indicating that these tools serve similar but distinct analytical purposes within the product ecosystem. Journeys appears more focused on conversion analysis between specific funnel steps, while Pathfinder offers broader path visualization capabilities.

These charts integrate with Amplitude's cohort creation functionality, allowing users to create segments based on the paths discovered through analysis.

## Technical Implementation

The documentation doesn't specify particular API endpoints or command line invocations for these features. However, it does mention technical requirements such as:

- The need for a session_id for session-based tracking in Pathfinder Users
- Limitations on custom events in Pathfinder
- Plan-specific availability (Plus/Growth/Enterprise plans for Journeys)

The tools appear to be primarily accessed through Amplitude's web interface rather than through direct API calls.
