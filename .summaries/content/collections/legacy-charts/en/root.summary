# Legacy Charts in Amplitude: Product Overview

## Product Overview

Legacy Charts in Amplitude is a suite of visualization tools designed to help product teams understand user behavior and navigation patterns within their applications. The suite includes three main components: Pathfinder, Pathfinder Users, and Journeys, each offering different approaches to visualizing and analyzing user flows and conversion paths.

These legacy visualization tools enable teams to:
- Track how users navigate through a product
- Identify common paths that lead to conversion or drop-off
- Analyze user behavior patterns before and after key events
- Discover friction points in the user experience
- Compare different user segments' navigation patterns
- Understand the time dimension of user conversions

## Product Relationships and Features

### Pathfinder
- Core visualization tool that displays user flows as a Sankey diagram
- Shows sequences of events users take during specified time periods
- Analyzes both incoming paths (events leading to a target) and outgoing paths (events following a target)
- Supports path analysis up to fifty steps deep
- Includes "Bucket below threshold" feature to group less common paths
- Offers filtering capabilities to remove noisy events
- Provides session-based tracking options

### Pathfinder Users
- Specialized version of Pathfinder focused on user-centric analysis
- Visualizes the most common sequences of events before or after a specified event
- Allows measurement by users or sessions
- Supports segmentation of users for comparative analysis
- Enables event expansion by properties for deeper insights
- Focuses on navigation analysis and user journey mapping

### Journeys
- Specialized tool for understanding user conversion paths between two funnel steps
- Limited to a 60-day timeframe analysis
- Provides step-by-step breakdowns of paths taken by both converted and dropped-off users
- Features TF-IDF auto-filter to highlight statistically significant paths
- Identifies friction points in the conversion process
- Shows which experiences lead to faster or slower conversions
- Supports path expansion by properties
- Enables cohort creation from path analysis

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Sankey Diagram**: The flow visualization format used in Pathfinder, where the width of arrows represents the volume of users following a particular path
- **Nodes**: Individual events or touchpoints in the user journey visualization
- **Bucket Below Threshold**: Feature that groups less common paths together to simplify visualization
- **TF-IDF Auto-filter**: Statistical method used in Journeys to highlight significant paths by comparing converted vs. dropped-off users
- **Conversion Timeframe**: The time period (up to 60 days in Journeys) analyzed for user conversions
- **Path Expansion by Properties**: Capability to break down events by their properties for more detailed analysis
- **Microscope**: Feature mentioned in Pathfinder for detailed analysis
- **Incoming/Outgoing Paths**: Directional analysis of events leading to or following a target event

## Product Ecosystem Integration

These legacy charts are part of Amplitude's analytics platform and are available on specific subscription tiers:
- Journeys is available on Plus, Growth, and Enterprise plans
- The tools integrate with other Amplitude features, such as cohort creation
- Journeys is positioned as complementary to Pathfinder, with each serving different analytical needs
- These are specifically labeled as "legacy" charts, suggesting they may be older versions of visualization tools that have been superseded by newer features in the Amplitude platform

## Usage Notes

While specific API endpoints or command line invocations are not explicitly mentioned in the documentation, these visualization tools are accessed through the Amplitude analytics interface. Users can configure the charts by:
- Selecting target events
- Setting time periods for analysis
- Configuring visualization parameters like path depth
- Applying filters to focus on specific user segments or behaviors
- Expanding events by properties for more detailed analysis

The "legacy" designation indicates that while these tools are still supported, users may be encouraged to transition to newer visualization features in the Amplitude platform for future analyses.
