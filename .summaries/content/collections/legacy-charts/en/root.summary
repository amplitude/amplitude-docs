## Amplitude Legacy Charts Product Overview

The Legacy Charts collection represents deprecated analytics visualization tools within Amplitude's behavioral analytics platform, specifically focused on user journey analysis and path visualization. These charts provide sophisticated user flow analysis capabilities but are being phased out in favor of newer experiences like the modern Journeys feature.

## Product Relationships and Features

The legacy charts ecosystem consists of three interconnected visualization tools:

**Pathfinder** serves as the foundational chart for aggregated user flow analysis, displaying event sequences through sankey diagrams and funnel visualizations. It processes up to 50 steps within a 45-day timeframe and requires session_id tracking for accurate path reconstruction.

**Pathfinder Users** extends the core Pathfinder functionality to individual user-level analysis, maintaining the same session-based tracking requirements but limiting analysis to 30-day timeframes. It provides granular visibility into specific user journeys rather than aggregated flows.

**Legacy Journeys** represents the most advanced iteration, focusing specifically on conversion path analysis between funnel steps. It extends the analysis window to 60 days and introduces sophisticated filtering capabilities through TF-IDF auto-filtering algorithms.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Session-based Tracking**: All legacy charts require `session_id` instrumentation for accurate event sequence reconstruction, with paths determined by `client_event_time` timestamps at millisecond resolution.

**Path Directionality**: Charts support both "starting with" (forward path analysis) and "ending with" (backward path analysis) event configurations to analyze user flows from different perspectives.

**TF-IDF Auto-filtering**: An algorithmic approach used in Legacy Journeys to automatically identify and filter signal from noise in user path data, with manual override capabilities through custom filters.

**Bucket Thresholds**: Configurable parameters that determine node visibility in path visualizations, with options to hide events below specified volume thresholds.

**Event Path Bridging**: The mechanism for connecting discrete events into coherent user journey sequences, particularly relevant for conversion and drop-off path analysis.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

These legacy charts integrate with several Amplitude platform components:

**Microscope Integration** enables drilling down from aggregate path visualizations into individual user sessions for detailed behavioral analysis.

**Behavioral Cohorts** can be created and saved from path analysis results, allowing users to segment audiences based on journey patterns for further analysis or targeting.

**Funnel Requirements**: Legacy Journeys specifically requires "in this order" funnel configurations to properly analyze conversion paths between defined steps.

**Plan Restrictions**: Advanced features are gated by subscription tiers (Plus/Growth/Enterprise plans), indicating these tools were positioned as premium analytics capabilities.

## Technical Implementation Details

**API Integration**: Charts support HTTP API session tracking for server-side event instrumentation, though session_id remains mandatory for accurate path reconstruction.

**Event Limitations**: Custom events are limited to the top 50 most frequent events, with inactive events automatically hidden from visualizations.

**Property Expansion**: Events can be expanded by properties to provide additional dimensional analysis within path flows.

**Migration Path**: The legacy charts are being consolidated into Amplitude's modern Journeys experience, representing the platform's evolution toward more unified user journey analysis tools.

The legacy charts collection demonstrates Amplitude's sophisticated approach to user behavior analysis through multiple complementary visualization methods, while also illustrating the platform's ongoing modernization efforts as these tools transition to newer implementations.
