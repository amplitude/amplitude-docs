## Amplitude Legacy Charts Product Overview

Amplitude's Legacy Charts collection comprises three deprecated chart types focused on user path analysis and conversion tracking: Legacy Journeys, Pathfinder, and Pathfinder Users. These charts provide sophisticated user flow visualization and conversion path analysis capabilities that are being migrated to newer Amplitude experiences.

## Product Relationships and Features

The three legacy chart types form a complementary suite of path analysis tools:

**Legacy Journeys** serves as the most advanced conversion analysis tool, examining user paths between funnel steps over extended periods (60 days) with intelligent filtering capabilities. It features TF-IDF auto-filtering heuristics to surface meaningful conversion patterns and supports both conversion and drop-off path analysis.

**Pathfinder** provides aggregated user flow visualization through sankey diagrams and funnel representations, focusing on session-based event sequences with support for up to 50 steps within 45-day timeframes.

**Pathfinder Users** offers individual user-level path analysis, tracking specific user journeys through event sequences within sessions, with a 30-day analysis window.

All three charts share common requirements for session-based tracking and event sequencing, with Pathfinder and Pathfinder Users specifically requiring `session_id` implementation for proper functionality.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Session-based tracking**: Core requirement using `session_id` for grouping related user events within defined time periods

**Starting/Ending events**: Configurable entry and exit points that define the boundaries of user path analysis

**Event sequences**: Chronologically ordered user actions tracked through `client_event_time` or `event_time` parameters

**TF-IDF auto-filter heuristic**: Advanced algorithmic filtering in Legacy Journeys that automatically identifies significant conversion patterns while reducing noise

**Bucket below threshold**: Pathfinder feature that groups low-volume paths to simplify visualization

**User stream drilling**: Capability to examine individual user behaviors within broader conversion patterns

**Microscope integration**: Feature allowing detailed inspection of specific user paths and behaviors

**"In this order" funnel requirement**: Strict sequential ordering constraint for meaningful path analysis

**Event property expansion**: Ability to segment and analyze paths based on specific event attributes

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

These legacy charts integrate with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem through several touchpoints:

- **Journeys Migration Path**: All legacy charts are being consolidated into Amplitude's new Journeys experience, indicating a strategic product evolution toward unified path analysis
- **Cohort Integration**: Legacy Journeys supports saving user segments from conversion paths for use in other Amplitude features
- **Plan Tier Availability**: Features are distributed across Plus, Growth, and Enterprise plans, showing integration with Amplitude's commercial structure
- **HTTP API Compatibility**: Charts support server-side event tracking through Amplitude's HTTP API with proper session management

## Technical Implementation Details

**API Requirements**: All charts require proper `session_id` implementation for HTTP API users to enable session-based path tracking

**Time Constraints**: 
- Legacy Journeys: 60-day analysis window
- Pathfinder: 45-day timeframe limit  
- Pathfinder Users: 30-day analysis limit

**Event Limitations**: Custom events are not supported across the legacy chart suite, requiring standard event implementation

**Visualization Capabilities**: 
- Sankey diagrams for flow visualization
- Funnel representations for conversion analysis
- Individual user stream examination
- Property-based event segmentation

**Filtering and Analysis Tools**:
- Signal filtering sliders for noise reduction
- Custom filter overrides for specific analysis needs
- Hide Noisy Events functionality
- Automated pattern recognition through TF-IDF algorithms

The legacy charts represent Amplitude's sophisticated approach to user journey analysis, providing multiple analytical perspectives on user behavior while maintaining consistent session-based tracking requirements across the suite.
