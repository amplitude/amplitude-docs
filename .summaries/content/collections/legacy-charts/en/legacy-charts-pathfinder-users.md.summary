The Pathfinder Users chart is a legacy Amplitude analytics feature that visualizes user journey paths through products by tracking event sequences within individual sessions, requiring session_id for accurate path tracking and supporting both forward ("starting with") and backward ("ending with") path analysis with a maximum 30-day timeframe.
