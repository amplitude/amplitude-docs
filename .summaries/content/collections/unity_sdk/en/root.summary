# Amplitude Analytics Unity SDK

## Overview

The Amplitude Analytics Unity SDK is a plugin that integrates Amplitude's analytics capabilities into Unity projects (version 2019.3.11 or higher). It serves as a wrapper for the native Amplitude iOS and Android SDKs, enabling developers to track user behavior, manage user properties, and analyze app usage across mobile platforms from within their Unity projects.

## Key Features

- **Cross-Platform Analytics**: Seamlessly works across iOS and Android platforms
- **Event Tracking**: Capture user interactions and custom events
- **User Property Management**: Store and update attributes about users
- **Revenue Tracking**: Monitor in-app purchases and revenue metrics
- **Session Management**: Configure and track user sessions
- **COPPA Compliance**: Controls for applications targeting children
- **EU Data Residency**: Option to store data in EU data centers
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Server-side configuration capabilities

## Installation Methods

The SDK can be installed through multiple methods:
1. **Unity Package Manager (UPM)**: Add the package via Git URL
2. **Manual Installation**: Download and import the Unity package directly
3. **CocoaPods/Gradle**: Configure native dependencies for iOS/Android

## Core Concepts and Nomenclature

- **Events**: User actions or occurrences tracked in the application
- **User Properties**: Attributes associated with users (demographics, preferences)
- **Event Properties**: Additional context attached to specific events
- **User ID**: Custom identifier for tracking unique users
- **Device ID**: Automatically generated identifier for anonymous users
- **Sessions**: Time periods of continuous user engagement
- **Revenue**: Monetary transactions within the application

## Key API Methods

- `Amplitude.Instance.init(apiKey)`: Initialize the SDK with your Amplitude API key
- `Amplitude.Instance.logEvent(eventType)`: Track a basic event
- `Amplitude.Instance.logEvent(eventType, eventProperties)`: Track an event with properties
- `Amplitude.Instance.setUserId(userId)`: Identify a user with a custom ID
- `Amplitude.Instance.setUserProperty(property, value)`: Set a user property
- `Amplitude.Instance.logRevenue(...)`: Track revenue events
- `Amplitude.Instance.setOptOut(optOut)`: Enable/disable tracking for the user

## Configuration Options

- **Tracking Options**: Control which identifiers are tracked (IDFA, IDFV, etc.)
- **Server Zone**: Set EU data residency with `setServerZone(AmplitudeServerZone.EU)`
- **Flush Events**: Configure automatic or manual event uploading
- **Session Timeout**: Customize session expiration time
- **Batch Events**: Control event batching behavior
- **Log Level**: Set SDK logging verbosity

## Advanced Features

- **COPPA Control**: Enable/disable for applications targeting children
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Retrieve and apply server-side configurations
- **Offline Mode**: Queue events when offline for later transmission
- **User Groups**: Associate users with organizations or groups
- **Identity Management**: Merge and manage user identities

## Integration with Amplitude Ecosystem

The Unity SDK connects to the broader Amplitude analytics platform, allowing developers to:
- View event data in Amplitude's analytics dashboard
- Create custom funnels and cohorts
- Analyze user behavior and retention
- Perform A/B testing
- Generate custom reports and visualizations

The SDK serves as the data collection layer, capturing events and user properties that can then be analyzed through Amplitude's web interface or exported to other systems.
