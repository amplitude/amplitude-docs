## Amplitude Analytics Unity SDK

The Amplitude Analytics Unity SDK is a comprehensive analytics plugin that enables Unity developers to integrate Amplitude's powerful analytics capabilities into their mobile games and applications. The SDK serves as a bridge between Unity projects (version 2019.3.11 and later) and Amplitude's native iOS and Android SDKs, providing seamless cross-platform analytics tracking.

## Product Features and Relationships

The Unity SDK acts as a wrapper around Amplitude's native mobile SDKs, leveraging the underlying iOS and Android implementations while providing a unified Unity interface. Key components include:

**Installation and Setup:**
- Unity Package Manager integration for streamlined installation
- Manual installation via `amplitude-unity.unitypackage`
- Automatic dependency resolution through `unity-jar-resolver`
- ProGuard obfuscation rules for Android builds
- OkHTTP dependency management

**Core Analytics Features:**
- Event logging with custom properties and metadata
- User property management through Identify operations
- Revenue tracking with receipt verification capabilities
- Session management and tracking controls
- Batch processing and upload optimization

**Platform-Specific Integrations:**
- iOS IDFA (Identifier for Advertisers) tracking via `CustomIdfa.m`
- Android GPS location services through `CustomGPS.m`
- App Set ID support for Android privacy compliance
- XCode simulator compatibility for iOS development

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Concepts:**
- **Identify Operations**: User property management functions including `setUserProperty`, `setOnce`, `add`, and `append` for maintaining user profiles
- **Event Logging**: Primary method for tracking user actions and behaviors within applications
- **Revenue Tracking**: Specialized event type using `logRevenue` with built-in receipt verification
- **Session Tracking**: Automated user session management controlled via `trackSessionEvents`

**Configuration Parameters:**
- **AmplitudeServerZone.EU**: Data residency setting for European Union compliance
- **setEventUploadPeriodSeconds**: Batching configuration for optimizing network requests
- **setMinTimeBetweenSessionsMillis**: Session timeout threshold configuration
- **enableCoppaControl**: COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) compliance toggle
- **setUseDynamicConfig**: Runtime configuration management enablement

**Privacy and Compliance:**
- **useAdvertisingIdForDeviceId**: iOS advertising identifier usage control
- **useAppSetIdForDeviceId**: Android App Set ID implementation for privacy-focused tracking

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Unity SDK operates within Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem by:

**Data Pipeline Integration:**
- Seamless data flow to Amplitude's analytics platform through native SDK foundations
- EU data residency support via `AmplitudeServerZone.EU` for GDPR compliance
- Dynamic configuration capabilities allowing real-time SDK behavior adjustments

**Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
- Unified API surface across iOS and Android platforms while maintaining platform-specific optimizations
- Integration with Unity's build pipeline and package management system
- Support for modern mobile development practices including ProGuard optimization and dependency resolution

**Privacy Framework Alignment:**
- COPPA compliance mechanisms for applications targeting children
- IDFA and App Set ID support aligning with Apple's App Tracking Transparency and Google's privacy initiatives
- Configurable tracking parameters to meet various regulatory requirements

## Technical Implementation

**API Endpoints and Methods:**
- Event tracking through standard logging methods with property attachment
- User identification via Identify API with multiple operation types
- Revenue verification through platform-specific receipt validation
- Session management through automated tracking controls

**Platform Requirements:**
- Android API 21+ compatibility ensuring broad device support
- Unity 2019.3.11+ requirement for modern Unity feature utilization
- iOS XCode simulator support for comprehensive development workflows

The SDK provides a complete analytics solution for Unity developers, abstracting the complexity of multi-platform implementation while maintaining access to advanced features and compliance controls necessary for modern mobile applications.
