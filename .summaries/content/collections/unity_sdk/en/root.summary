## Amplitude Analytics Unity SDK

The Amplitude Analytics Unity SDK is a cross-platform analytics solution that enables Unity developers to integrate Amplitude's event tracking and user analytics capabilities into their games and applications. The SDK serves as a wrapper around Amplitude's native iOS and Android SDKs, providing a unified interface for Unity projects while maintaining platform-specific optimizations.

### Core Features and Capabilities

The Unity SDK supports comprehensive analytics functionality including event tracking with custom properties, user property management through Identify operations, revenue tracking with built-in verification, session management, and advanced device identification features. The SDK is compatible with Unity 2019.3.11 and later versions, supporting both iOS and Android platforms with specific optimizations for each.

### Installation and Integration

The SDK offers flexible installation methods through Unity Package Manager using Git URLs or manual installation via the amplitude-unity.unitypackage file. The integration includes automatic dependency management through unity-jar-resolver for Android projects and handles platform-specific requirements like OkHTTP dependencies and Android API 21 compatibility. For iOS projects, the SDK manages XCode simulator compatibility and Device SDK vs Simulator SDK configurations.

### Configuration and Data Management

Configuration options include EU data residency support through AmplitudeServerZone.EU and setServerZone() methods, COPPA compliance via enableCoppaControl(), and customizable upload intervals using setEventUploadPeriodSeconds(). Session management is handled through setMinTimeBetweenSessionsMillis() and trackSessionEvents() functionality, with support for outOfSession events when needed.

### User and Event Tracking

The SDK provides comprehensive user property management through Identify operations including setUserProperty(), setOnce(), addUserProperty(), appendUserProperty(), and clearUserProperties(). Group analytics are supported via setGroup() and logEventWithGroups() methods. Revenue tracking is implemented through logRevenue() with built-in verification capabilities.

### Device Identification and Privacy

Advanced device identification features include advertising ID configuration through useAdvertisingIdForDeviceId() and useAppSetIdForDeviceId() for Android, and IDFA tracking setup for iOS using CustomIdfa.m implementations. Privacy controls are managed through setTrackingOptions(), setOptOut(), and platform-specific privacy configurations in Info.plist including "Privacy - Tracking Usage Description" and "Location Usage Description" entries.

### Platform-Specific Features

iOS-specific functionality includes IDFA and GPS location tracking through CustomIdfa.m and CustomGPS.m files, DllImport configurations, and setIdfaBlock()/setLocationInfoBlock() methods. Android-specific features include ProGuard obfuscation support, advertising ID management, and app set ID utilization for enhanced user tracking while maintaining privacy compliance.

### Dynamic Configuration and Optimization

The SDK supports dynamic configuration through setUseDynamicConfig() for runtime optimization and includes built-in performance features for efficient data transmission and storage. The architecture ensures seamless integration with Unity's development workflow while maintaining the full feature set of Amplitude's native mobile SDKs.
