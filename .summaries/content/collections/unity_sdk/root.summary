# Amplitude Analytics Unity SDK

## High-Level Overview

The Amplitude Analytics Unity SDK is a comprehensive analytics solution for Unity game developers, supporting projects built on Unity 2019.3.11 or higher. This SDK functions as a wrapper for Amplitude's native iOS and Android SDKs, enabling developers to implement cross-platform analytics capabilities within their Unity projects. The SDK allows tracking of user behavior, management of user properties, and analysis of revenue metrics across mobile platforms.

Key features include event tracking, user property management, revenue tracking, session management, COPPA compliance controls, EU data residency options, and dynamic configuration capabilities. The SDK is designed to provide valuable insights into user engagement and behavior within games and applications built with Unity.

## Product Relationships and Features

The Amplitude Analytics Unity SDK serves as a bridge between Unity game development and Amplitude's analytics platform. The product architecture includes:

1. **Core Analytics Engine**: The foundation that processes and transmits event data to Amplitude's servers
2. **Platform-Specific Adapters**: Components that handle iOS and Android-specific implementations
3. **Configuration Module**: Manages SDK settings and behavior options
4. **Identity Management**: Handles user identification across sessions and devices
5. **Event Tracking System**: Captures and processes user interactions and custom events
6. **Revenue Tracking Module**: Specialized component for monitoring in-app purchases

The SDK integrates with Unity's development environment while connecting to Amplitude's backend services. It handles platform-specific requirements automatically, including iOS App Tracking Transparency compliance and Android permissions management.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Events**: User actions or occurrences tracked in the application (e.g., level completions, feature usage)
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes associated with users (demographics, preferences, settings)
- **Event Properties**: Contextual data attached to specific events for deeper analysis
- **Sessions**: Defined periods of user engagement with the application
- **User ID**: Custom identifier for tracking individual users across devices and sessions
- **Device ID**: Fallback identifier used when a user is not logged in
- **IDFA**: Identifier for Advertisers on iOS platforms
- **ADID**: Google Advertising ID for Android platforms
- **Revenue**: Monetary transactions tracked within the application
- **COPPA**: Children's Online Privacy Protection Act compliance controls

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude Analytics Unity SDK is part of Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem:

1. **Data Collection**: The SDK captures events and properties from Unity applications
2. **Amplitude Dashboard**: Collected data is visualized and analyzed in Amplitude's web interface
3. **User Segmentation**: The platform enables creating user segments based on behavior patterns
4. **Funnel Analysis**: Developers can analyze user journeys and conversion paths
5. **Dynamic Configuration**: Server-side configuration capabilities allow remote adjustments
6. **Data Export**: Integration with other systems in the Amplitude ecosystem for extended analysis

The SDK is designed to work with minimal configuration while offering advanced options for developers who need granular control over their analytics implementation.

## API Endpoints and Code Examples

### Initialization
```csharp
Amplitude amplitude = Amplitude.getInstance();
amplitude.init("API_KEY");
```

### Event Tracking
```csharp
// Basic event
amplitude.logEvent("EVENT_TYPE");

// Event with properties
Dictionary<string, object> eventProps = new Dictionary<string, object>();
eventProps.Add("property1", "value1");
amplitude.logEvent("EVENT_TYPE", eventProps);
```

### User Properties Management
```csharp
// Set user properties
Dictionary<string, object> userProps = new Dictionary<string, object>();
userProps.Add("gender", "female");
amplitude.setUserProperties(userProps);

// Individual property operations
amplitude.setUserProperty("premium_user", true);
amplitude.clearUserProperties();
```

### User Identity Management
```csharp
amplitude.setUserId("user@example.com");
amplitude.regenerateDeviceId();
```

### Revenue Tracking
```csharp
Revenue revenue = new Revenue().setProductId("com.company.app.productid")
                              .setPrice(3.99)
                              .setQuantity(1);
amplitude.logRevenueV2(revenue);
```

### Configuration Options
```csharp
// EU Data Residency
amplitude.setServerUrl("https://api.eu.amplitude.com");

// Session Configuration
amplitude.setSessionTimeoutMillis(30 * 60 * 1000);

// Privacy Controls
amplitude.setOptOut(true);
amplitude.enableCoppaControl();

// Debugging
amplitude.enableLogging(true);
```

The SDK supports multiple installation methods including Unity Package Manager (UPM), manual package import, and platform-specific integrations via CocoaPods/Gradle, providing flexibility for different development workflows and requirements.
