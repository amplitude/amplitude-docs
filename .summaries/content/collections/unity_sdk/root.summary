## Amplitude Analytics Unity SDK

The Amplitude Analytics Unity SDK is a cross-platform analytics solution designed for Unity game and application developers to integrate comprehensive event tracking and user analytics capabilities. The SDK functions as a unified wrapper around Amplitude's native iOS and Android SDKs, providing platform-specific optimizations while maintaining a consistent Unity interface.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Unity SDK operates through a layered architecture where the core Unity interface communicates with underlying native mobile SDKs. The primary components include:

**Event Tracking System**: Central event logging functionality with custom properties support, working in conjunction with session management and user identification systems. Events can be tracked with custom properties, grouped analytics via `setGroup()` and `logEventWithGroups()`, and special revenue events through `logRevenue()` with built-in verification.

**User Management Layer**: Comprehensive user property management through Identify operations, including `setUserProperty()`, `setOnce()`, `addUserProperty()`, `appendUserProperty()`, and `clearUserProperties()`. This layer integrates with device identification systems and privacy controls.

**Device Identification Framework**: Multi-tiered identification system supporting advertising IDs (`useAdvertisingIdForDeviceId()`), app set IDs (`useAppSetIdForDeviceId()` for Android), and platform-specific identifiers like IDFA for iOS through `CustomIdfa.m` implementations.

**Session Management Engine**: Handles session lifecycle through `setMinTimeBetweenSessionsMillis()` and `trackSessionEvents()`, with support for `outOfSession` events when session context is not required.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Identify Operations**: User property modification commands that batch multiple property changes into single API calls for efficiency.

**AmplitudeServerZone**: Configuration enum supporting EU data residency compliance through `AmplitudeServerZone.EU` designation.

**COPPA Control**: Children's Online Privacy Protection Act compliance mechanism enabled via `enableCoppaControl()`.

**Dynamic Configuration**: Runtime optimization feature accessible through `setUseDynamicConfig()` for performance tuning.

**Tracking Options**: Privacy control mechanism implemented via `setTrackingOptions()` to selectively disable data collection categories.

**Revenue Verification**: Built-in validation system for revenue events ensuring data integrity in monetization tracking.

**OutOfSession Events**: Special event category that bypasses session context requirements for specific tracking scenarios.

## Platform-Specific Integration Components

**iOS Implementation**: Utilizes `CustomIdfa.m` and `CustomGPS.m` files for IDFA and location tracking, requires Info.plist entries for "Privacy - Tracking Usage Description" and "Location Usage Description", and implements `setIdfaBlock()`/`setLocationInfoBlock()` methods with DllImport configurations.

**Android Implementation**: Incorporates ProGuard obfuscation support, advertising ID management, app set ID utilization, OkHTTP dependencies, and Android API 21+ compatibility requirements managed through unity-jar-resolver.

## Ecosystem Integration and Compatibility

The Unity SDK integrates into the broader Amplitude analytics ecosystem by maintaining feature parity with native mobile SDKs while providing Unity-specific optimizations. Installation methods include Unity Package Manager via Git URLs or manual installation through amplitude-unity.unitypackage files. The SDK requires Unity 2019.3.11+ and automatically manages platform dependencies.

The SDK connects to Amplitude's cloud analytics platform for data processing and visualization, supporting EU data residency requirements and enterprise-grade privacy controls. Configuration options like `setEventUploadPeriodSeconds()` control data transmission intervals, while `setOptOut()` provides user-level privacy controls.

## API Endpoints and Configuration Methods

Key configuration methods include:
- `setServerZone()` for data residency control
- `setEventUploadPeriodSeconds()` for upload interval management  
- `setMinTimeBetweenSessionsMillis()` for session configuration
- `setTrackingOptions()` for privacy controls
- `setUseDynamicConfig()` for runtime optimization

The SDK handles automatic dependency resolution and platform-specific build configurations, ensuring seamless integration with Unity's development workflow while maintaining full access to Amplitude's analytics capabilities across iOS and Android platforms.
