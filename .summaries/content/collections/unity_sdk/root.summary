# Amplitude Analytics Unity SDK

## Product Overview

The Amplitude Analytics Unity SDK is a comprehensive analytics solution for Unity developers (Unity 2019.3.11+) that enables tracking user behavior, managing user properties, and analyzing app usage across mobile platforms. The SDK functions as a wrapper for the native Amplitude iOS and Android SDKs, allowing developers to implement analytics capabilities directly within their Unity projects without managing separate platform-specific implementations.

Key features include event tracking, user property management, revenue monitoring, session tracking, COPPA compliance controls, EU data residency options, and server-side configuration capabilities. The SDK supports both iOS and Android platforms, providing a unified analytics solution for cross-platform mobile game and application development.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Unity SDK serves as an abstraction layer that communicates with the native Amplitude SDKs for iOS and Android. This architecture allows Unity developers to:

1. Write analytics code once in C# within Unity
2. Have the SDK automatically handle platform-specific implementations
3. Seamlessly integrate with the broader Amplitude analytics ecosystem

The SDK consists of several components:
- Core tracking functionality (Amplitude.Instance)
- Platform-specific plugins for iOS and Android
- Configuration modules for customizing SDK behavior
- Identity management for user tracking

The Unity SDK depends on the native Amplitude SDKs, which must be properly integrated into the iOS and Android builds of Unity applications. For iOS, this involves CocoaPods integration, while Android uses Gradle dependencies.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Events**: User actions or occurrences tracked in the application (e.g., "Button Clicked", "Level Completed")
- **Event Properties**: Additional contextual data attached to events (e.g., level number, score, time spent)
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes associated with users (e.g., demographics, preferences, account type)
- **User ID**: Custom identifier for tracking unique users across sessions and devices
- **Device ID**: Automatically generated identifier for anonymous users
- **Session**: A period of continuous user engagement, defined by configurable timeout parameters
- **Revenue**: Monetary transactions within the application, tracked with specific revenue events
- **Tracking Options**: Configuration settings that control which identifiers and data points are collected
- **Server Zone**: Geographic region where data is stored (US or EU)
- **COPPA**: Children's Online Privacy Protection Act - special tracking limitations for apps targeting children

## Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude Analytics Unity SDK is part of Amplitude's broader analytics platform ecosystem:

1. **Data Collection Layer**: The Unity SDK captures events, user properties, and behavioral data from Unity applications
2. **Data Processing**: Collected data is transmitted to Amplitude's servers for processing and storage
3. **Analytics Dashboard**: Developers can access and analyze the collected data through Amplitude's web interface
4. **Insights and Reporting**: The platform provides tools for creating custom funnels, cohorts, and visualizations
5. **Integration Capabilities**: Data can be exported to other systems or used with additional Amplitude products

The SDK integrates with other Amplitude products such as Experiment (for A/B testing) and Recommend (for personalization), allowing developers to not only collect data but also act on insights through these complementary tools.

## API Endpoints and Implementation

Key API methods for implementing the SDK include:

```csharp
// Initialization
Amplitude.Instance.init("YOUR_API_KEY");

// Basic event tracking
Amplitude.Instance.logEvent("Event Name");

// Event with properties
Dictionary<string, object> eventProperties = new Dictionary<string, object>();
eventProperties.Add("property1", "value1");
Amplitude.Instance.logEvent("Event With Properties", eventProperties);

// User identification
Amplitude.Instance.setUserId("user@example.com");

// User properties
Dictionary<string, object> userProperties = new Dictionary<string, object>();
userProperties.Add("userType", "premium");
Amplitude.Instance.setUserProperties(userProperties);

// Revenue tracking
Amplitude.Instance.logRevenue("productId", 1, 3.99);

// Advanced revenue tracking
Revenue revenue = new Revenue().setProductId("productId").setPrice(3.99).setQuantity(2);
revenue.setRevenueType("purchase").setEventProperties(properties);
Amplitude.Instance.logRevenueV2(revenue);

// Configuration options
Amplitude.Instance.setServerZone(AmplitudeServerZone.EU);
Amplitude.Instance.setEventUploadThreshold(30);
Amplitude.Instance.setEventUploadPeriodMillis(30000);
```

The SDK also provides configuration options through the `TrackingOptions` class to control privacy settings and data collection parameters:

```csharp
TrackingOptions options = new TrackingOptions();
options.disableIDFA();
options.disableIDFV();
Amplitude.Instance.setTrackingOptions(options);
```

These API methods allow developers to fully integrate Amplitude analytics capabilities into their Unity applications while maintaining control over data collection practices and privacy considerations.
