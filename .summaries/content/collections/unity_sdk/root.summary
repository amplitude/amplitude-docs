The Amplitude Analytics Unity SDK is a comprehensive analytics plugin that bridges Amplitude's native iOS and Android SDKs with Unity game development environments. Supporting Unity 2019.3.11 and later versions, the SDK provides developers with robust event tracking, user analytics, and revenue monitoring capabilities specifically tailored for Unity projects.

## Core Product Architecture

The Unity SDK functions as a wrapper around Amplitude's core mobile SDKs, delivering a unified analytics solution that maintains native performance while providing Unity-specific integration patterns. The architecture consists of three primary layers: the Unity interface layer that exposes C# APIs to developers, a native bridge layer that handles platform-specific communications, and the underlying iOS/Android SDKs that manage data collection and transmission.

The SDK offers dual installation pathways - Unity Package Manager integration for streamlined dependency management and manual `.unitypackage` installation for custom deployment scenarios. The core package (`amplitude-unity.unitypackage`) includes the `unity-jar-resolver` dependency management system and integrates with the `OkHTTP dependency` for Android network communications.

## Feature Relationships and Capabilities

**Analytics Core:**
- Event tracking with custom properties and metadata through standard `logEvent` operations
- User property management via `Identify operations` including `setUserProperty`, `setOnce`, and `append operations`
- Revenue tracking with built-in verification systems through `logRevenue verification`
- Automatic session management with configurable `session_id tracking`

**Configuration Management:**
The SDK provides extensive configuration options including server zone selection via `AmplitudeServerZone.EU` for European data residency, batching behavior control through `setEventUploadPeriodSeconds`, session timeout configuration with `setMinTimeBetweenSessionsMillis`, and dynamic configuration capabilities via `setUseDynamicConfig`.

**Platform Integration:**
Cross-platform compatibility is achieved through unified API surfaces while maintaining platform-specific optimizations. The SDK supports `trackSessionEvents` for automatic session lifecycle tracking and provides seamless integration with Unity's development workflow.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Installation Components:**
- `amplitude-unity.unitypackage` - Primary SDK distribution package
- `unity-jar-resolver` - Android dependency resolution system
- `OkHTTP dependency` - Network communication library for Android builds

**Configuration Parameters:**
- `AmplitudeServerZone.EU` - European server endpoint selection for GDPR compliance
- `setEventUploadPeriodSeconds` - Batch upload frequency control (default varies by platform)
- `setMinTimeBetweenSessionsMillis` - Session timeout threshold definition
- `setUseDynamicConfig` - Runtime configuration update enablement

**Privacy and Compliance Controls:**
- `COPPA control` - Children's Online Privacy Protection Act compliance framework
- `useAdvertisingIdForDeviceId` - iOS advertising identifier utilization toggle
- `useAppSetIdForDeviceId` - Android App Set ID implementation for privacy-focused tracking
- `iOS IDFA setup` - iOS Identifier for Advertisers configuration system

**Platform-Specific Implementation:**
- `CustomIdfa.m` - iOS advertising identifier native implementation
- `CustomGPS.m` - iOS location services integration module
- `DllImport` - Native code bridge mechanism for Unity-to-native communication
- `ProGuard obfuscation rules` - Android release build code protection configuration

## Ecosystem Integration and Data Flow

The Unity SDK operates within Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem, maintaining API consistency with native mobile SDKs while adapting to Unity's development paradigms. Events flow through identical ingestion pipelines as traditional mobile applications, ensuring unified analytics across platform boundaries.

**Cross-Platform Analytics Integration:**
The SDK enables unified user tracking across Unity games and conventional mobile applications, supporting consistent user journey analysis regardless of platform. Revenue analytics integrate with Amplitude's verification systems, providing transaction validation across Unity's in-app purchase frameworks.

**Privacy Framework Compliance:**
Integration with global privacy regulations occurs through COPPA controls, advertising identifier management systems, and configurable data residency options via server zone selection.

## Technical Implementation Specifications

**Platform Requirements:**
- Unity 2019.3.11+ compatibility
- Android API 21+ minimum requirements
- iOS deployment through Build Settings platform selection
- ProGuard rule configuration for Android release builds

**API Endpoints and Configuration:**
The SDK communicates with Amplitude's ingestion endpoints, with automatic failover and retry mechanisms. Server zone configuration (`AmplitudeServerZone.EU`) directs traffic to appropriate regional endpoints for compliance requirements.

**Revenue Tracking Implementation:**
Revenue verification systems integrate with platform-specific purchase validation, supporting both real-time transaction logging and batch revenue reporting through the `logRevenue verification` framework.

**Session Management:**
Automatic session lifecycle tracking operates through configurable timeout parameters, with `session_id tracking` maintaining consistency across application state changes and platform-specific lifecycle events.

The SDK provides a complete analytics solution specifically engineered for Unity developers, delivering Amplitude's full feature set while accommodating game development workflows and cross-platform deployment requirements.
