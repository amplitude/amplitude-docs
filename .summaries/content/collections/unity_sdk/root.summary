# Amplitude Analytics Unity SDK

## Product Overview

The Amplitude Analytics Unity SDK is a comprehensive analytics solution for Unity developers that enables tracking user behavior, managing user properties, and analyzing app usage patterns across mobile platforms. The SDK functions as a wrapper for the native Amplitude iOS and Android SDKs, allowing developers to implement analytics capabilities directly within their Unity projects (version 2019.3.11 or higher).

### Key Features
- Cross-platform analytics tracking for iOS and Android
- Event and user property tracking
- Revenue monitoring for in-app purchases
- Session management with configurable timeouts
- User identification and grouping
- COPPA compliance controls
- EU data residency options
- Dynamic configuration for server-side feature flags
- Batch event processing for efficiency

### Primary Use Cases
- Tracking user interactions and engagement
- Monitoring conversion funnels and user journeys
- Analyzing user behavior patterns
- Measuring revenue and monetization performance
- Segmenting users based on properties and behaviors

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Amplitude Unity SDK sits as a middleware layer between Unity applications and Amplitude's analytics backend:

1. **Unity Application Layer**: Where developers implement the SDK to capture events
2. **Unity SDK Layer**: Processes events and manages configuration
3. **Native SDK Layer**: The Unity SDK delegates to native iOS and Android SDKs
4. **Amplitude Backend**: Where data is stored and made available for analysis

The SDK maintains compatibility with Amplitude's broader ecosystem, allowing data collected through the Unity SDK to be analyzed alongside data from other platforms and SDKs.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: A discrete user action or occurrence tracked in the application
- **Event Properties**: Key-value pairs providing additional context about an event
- **User Properties**: Attributes associated with a specific user that persist across sessions
- **User ID**: A unique identifier for a user, typically set after authentication
- **Device ID**: A unique identifier for a device when user is anonymous
- **Session**: A period of continuous user engagement, defined by configurable timeout
- **Revenue**: Monetary transactions tracked within the application
- **User Groups**: Logical groupings of users for organizational analysis
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Server-side feature flags and settings
- **COPPA**: Children's Online Privacy Protection Act compliance controls

## Integration with Amplitude Ecosystem

The Unity SDK integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics platform:

1. **Data Collection**: The SDK captures events and properties from Unity applications
2. **Data Processing**: Amplitude's backend processes and organizes the collected data
3. **Analytics Dashboard**: Developers access insights through Amplitude's web interface
4. **Cross-Platform Analysis**: Data can be analyzed alongside information from other platforms
5. **Integration Capabilities**: Connects with other Amplitude products like Experiment and Recommend

The SDK serves as the foundation for implementing Amplitude's more advanced features like cohort analysis, funnel visualization, and behavioral analytics.

## API and Implementation Details

### Installation Methods
```
# Via Unity Package Manager with Git URL
https://github.com/amplitude/unity-plugin.git
```

### Initialization
```csharp
Amplitude amplitude = Amplitude.getInstance();
amplitude.init("YOUR_API_KEY");
```

### Configuration Options
```csharp
// Set log level
amplitude.setLogLevel(AmplitudeLogLevel.DEBUG);

// Configure session timeout (in milliseconds)
amplitude.setSessionTimeoutMillis(1800000);

// Enable EU data residency
amplitude.setServerZone(AmplitudeServerZone.EU);

// Set event upload threshold
amplitude.setEventUploadThreshold(30);
```

### Event Tracking
```csharp
// Basic event
amplitude.logEvent("Button Clicked");

// Event with properties
Dictionary<string, object> eventProps = new Dictionary<string, object>();
eventProps.Add("button_color", "blue");
eventProps.Add("screen", "main_menu");
amplitude.logEvent("Button Clicked", eventProps);
```

### User Identification
```csharp
// Set user ID
amplitude.setUserId("user@example.com");

// Reset to anonymous user
amplitude.setUserId(null);
amplitude.regenerateDeviceId();
```

### User Properties
```csharp
// Set a single property
amplitude.setUserProperty("subscription_type", "premium");

// Set multiple properties
Dictionary<string, object> userProps = new Dictionary<string, object>();
userProps.Add("age", 25);
userProps.Add("gender", "female");
amplitude.setUserProperties(userProps);

// Increment a property
amplitude.add("login_count", 1);
```

### Revenue Tracking
```csharp
Revenue revenue = new Revenue()
    .setProductId("com.game.premium_currency")
    .setPrice(9.99)
    .setQuantity(100)
    .setRevenueType("iap");
amplitude.logRevenueV2(revenue);
```

### User Grouping
```csharp
// Assign user to a group
amplitude.setGroup("organization", "company_xyz");

// Assign user to multiple groups
string[] groups = new string[] {"team_a", "team_b"};
amplitude.setGroup("teams", groups);
```

The SDK provides these core APIs while handling the complexities of cross-platform implementation, event batching, and network communication with Amplitude's servers.
