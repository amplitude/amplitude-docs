# Amplitude Analytics Unity SDK

## Product Overview

The Amplitude Analytics Unity SDK is a comprehensive analytics solution for Unity game developers (Unity 2019.3.11+) that enables tracking user behavior, managing user properties, and analyzing revenue metrics. The SDK functions as a wrapper for the native Amplitude iOS and Android SDKs, providing a unified interface for cross-platform analytics implementation within Unity projects.

## Key Features and Capabilities

- **Cross-Platform Analytics**: Seamless tracking across iOS and Android platforms
- **Event Tracking**: Capture user interactions, custom events, and behavioral data
- **User Property Management**: Store and update user attributes and characteristics
- **Revenue Tracking**: Monitor in-app purchases and monetization metrics
- **Session Management**: Configure and track user engagement sessions
- **COPPA Compliance**: Controls for applications targeting children
- **EU Data Residency**: Option to store data in European data centers
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Server-side configuration capabilities
- **Offline Processing**: Queue events when offline for later transmission

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Unity SDK serves as the data collection layer within the Amplitude ecosystem:

1. **Unity Integration Layer**: The SDK provides Unity-specific interfaces for game developers
2. **Native SDK Wrapper**: Internally wraps the native iOS and Android SDKs
3. **Analytics Backend Connection**: Transmits collected data to Amplitude's analytics platform
4. **Dashboard Visualization**: Data becomes available in Amplitude's web interface for analysis

The SDK bridges the gap between Unity game development and Amplitude's analytics infrastructure, allowing developers to implement analytics without leaving the Unity environment.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: A discrete user action or occurrence tracked in the system (e.g., "Button Clicked")
- **Event Properties**: Additional contextual data associated with an event
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes associated with a user (e.g., age, gender)
- **Revenue Event**: A specialized event for tracking monetary transactions
- **Session**: A period of continuous user engagement, defined by configurable timeout periods
- **API Key**: Unique identifier that authenticates your application with Amplitude's servers
- **User ID**: Custom identifier assigned to track individual users across sessions
- **Device ID**: Automatically generated identifier for a specific device
- **COPPA**: Children's Online Privacy Protection Act - regulations for apps targeting children

## Integration with Amplitude Ecosystem

The Unity SDK integrates with the broader Amplitude platform to enable:

1. **Data Collection**: Capturing events and properties from Unity applications
2. **Analytics Dashboards**: Visualizing collected data in Amplitude's web interface
3. **Cohort Analysis**: Segmenting users based on behaviors and properties
4. **User Journey Tracking**: Analyzing user paths through the application
5. **Retention Metrics**: Measuring user engagement over time
6. **Custom Reports**: Creating specialized visualizations and analyses

## API and Implementation Details

### Installation Methods

```
// Unity Package Manager (UPM)
https://github.com/amplitude/unity-plugin.git
```

### Core API Methods

```csharp
// Initialization
Amplitude amplitude = Amplitude.getInstance();
amplitude.init("YOUR_API_KEY");

// Event Tracking
amplitude.logEvent("Button Clicked");

// Event with Properties
Dictionary<string, object> eventProperties = new Dictionary<string, object>();
eventProperties.Add("property1", "value1");
amplitude.logEvent("Button Clicked", eventProperties);

// User Properties
amplitude.setUserProperty("user_type", "premium");
amplitude.add("login_count", 1);

// Revenue Tracking
Revenue revenue = new Revenue().setProductId("com.company.app.productid")
                              .setPrice(3.99)
                              .setQuantity(1);
amplitude.logRevenueV2(revenue);

// Session Configuration
amplitude.setSessionTimeoutMillis(10 * 60 * 1000);

// COPPA Compliance
amplitude.enableCoppaControl();

// EU Data Residency
amplitude.setServerUrl("https://api.eu.amplitude.com");
```

The SDK provides a comprehensive set of methods for tracking various aspects of user behavior and application performance, allowing developers to gather rich analytics data for improving their Unity games and applications.
