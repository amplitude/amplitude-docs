# Amplitude Migration Documentation Suite

This comprehensive migration documentation enables organizations to transition from major analytics and customer data platforms to Amplitude's unified analytics and CDP ecosystem. The suite addresses four critical migration pathways: Adobe Analytics, Google Analytics (GA4), Mixpanel, and mParticle/Segment, each designed to handle distinct data architecture challenges and implementation complexities.

## Product Relationships and Migration Architecture

The migration framework operates through a standardized three-tier architecture that ensures consistent data transformation and implementation patterns across all source platforms:

**Data Model Transformation Layer** handles the fundamental architectural differences between platforms. Adobe Analytics migrations require complex mapping from legacy variable structures (eVars, props, success events) to Amplitude's event-centric schema. Google Analytics GA4 transitions involve converting gtag-based measurement to Amplitude's structured event model. Mixpanel migrations focus on transforming super properties into user properties while maintaining event taxonomy. Segment and mParticle migrations address CDP-to-CDP data pipeline continuity, preserving existing source and destination configurations.

**Implementation Layer** provides SDK-specific code transformation patterns across Browser SDK 2.0, iOS Swift SDK, and Android Kotlin SDK. Direct API mapping examples demonstrate platform-specific conversions: `mixpanel.track()` to `amplitude.logEvent()`, `gtag()` to `amplitude.track()`, and Adobe Analytics variable assignments to Amplitude event properties. Tag management system integrations support gradual migration through Adobe Launch extensions, Google Tag Manager templates, and Tealium configurations.

**Validation and Data Continuity Layer** ensures migration integrity through integrated validation tools including Ingestion Debugger, User Lookup, and Event Explorer Chrome extension. Historical data preservation strategies utilize Batch Event Upload API combined with platform-specific export mechanisms (Adobe Data Feeds, Mixpanel Export API, BigQuery exports).

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Event-Centric Data Model**: Amplitude's foundational architecture where all user interactions are captured as discrete events with associated properties, replacing Adobe's variable-based tracking (eVars/props) and standardizing mixed approaches from other platforms.

**Tracking Plan**: Amplitude's schema governance system that supersedes Adobe's Solution Design Reference (SDR) and provides centralized event taxonomy management with validation rules and data quality enforcement.

**User Identification Mapping**: Critical process maintaining user identity continuity across platform transitions, involving device_id and user_id resolution, Adobe visitor ID preservation, and CDP identity graph maintenance.

**Sources and Destinations**: Amplitude CDP architecture components where Sources represent data ingestion points and Destinations enable data activation, directly replacing mParticle and Segment workflow patterns.

**Component Manager**: Enterprise tool for managing complex data taxonomies and governance structures, particularly relevant for Adobe Analytics enterprise migrations requiring structured variable mapping.

**Time to Live (TTL)**: Data retention configuration system used in migration tools, particularly the Mixpanel Import Tool, to manage historical data processing and storage optimization.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude positions itself as a comprehensive replacement for enterprise analytics and CDP infrastructure through strategic ecosystem integration:

**Customer Data Platform Capabilities** directly compete with Segment and mParticle through native source/destination management, multi-environment deployment support, and preservation of existing data activation workflows. The platform maintains compatibility with downstream marketing, personalization, and business intelligence tools.

**Enterprise Analytics Replacement** targets Adobe Analytics through Component Manager integration, Analysis Workspace functionality replication, and enterprise data warehouse connectivity. Adobe Data Feeds backfill processes ensure historical reporting continuity.

**Tag Management Ecosystem Integration** supports gradual migration strategies through native integrations with Adobe Launch, Google Tag Manager, and Tealium, enabling parallel data collection during transition periods without complete implementation overhauls.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Batch Event Upload API** serves as the primary endpoint for historical data migration across all platforms, supporting bulk transfer from Adobe Data Feeds, Mixpanel Export API, BigQuery exports, and CDP data exports with rate limiting and error handling.

**Analytics HTTP v2 API** provides real-time event ingestion, replacing platform-specific APIs including Adobe Analytics Data Insertion API, GA4 Measurement Protocol, and Mixpanel HTTP API with unified authentication and payload structures.

**Mixpanel Import Tool** offers dedicated migration utility with service account authentication, GDPR compliance features, and configurable TTL settings for automated historical data transfer with progress monitoring and error recovery.

**Google Analytics Event Forwarder Plugin** enables low-code migration through automatic GA4 event forwarding to Amplitude, supporting parallel data collection without code modifications during transition periods.

The migration suite emphasizes Professional Services support for complex enterprise implementations, comprehensive multi-platform data validation processes, and structured testing frameworks to ensure data integrity and business continuity throughout migration processes. Each pathway includes specific validation checkpoints, rollback procedures, and performance optimization guidelines tailored to the source platform's unique characteristics.
