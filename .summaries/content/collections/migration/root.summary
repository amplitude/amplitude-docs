# Amplitude Migration Suite

## Product Overview

Amplitude Migration Suite is a comprehensive set of tools, documentation, and methodologies designed to facilitate the transition from various analytics platforms to Amplitude's analytics ecosystem. The suite supports migrations from major analytics providers including Segment, mParticle, Adobe Analytics, Mixpanel, and Google Analytics (GA4). It enables organizations to maintain data continuity, preserve historical insights, and leverage Amplitude's advanced analytics capabilities with minimal disruption to existing workflows.

## Key Features and Concepts

- **Platform-Specific Migration Paths**: Tailored migration approaches for each source platform (Segment, mParticle, Adobe Analytics, Mixpanel, GA4)
- **Implementation Conversion**: Detailed code examples for converting tracking implementations across platforms
- **Data Model Mapping**: Comprehensive guidance on mapping source platform concepts to Amplitude's data model
- **Historical Data Migration**: Methods for backfilling historical data from previous platforms
- **Validation Tools**: Processes and tools to verify successful migration
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Migration paths for Browser, iOS, and Android implementations
- **Low-Code Options**: Plugin-based approaches for simpler migrations (particularly for GA4)

## Product Relationships and Features

The Migration Suite consists of several interconnected components:

1. **Source Platform Connectors**: Platform-specific integration points that understand the data models and implementation patterns of source platforms
2. **SDK Implementation Converters**: Tools and documentation to help convert existing tracking code to Amplitude equivalents
3. **Data Validation Framework**: Methods to ensure data integrity during and after migration
4. **Historical Data Import Tools**: Specialized tools like the Mixpanel Import Tool for historical data migration

These components work together to provide a complete migration path from legacy analytics platforms to Amplitude's ecosystem.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Source Platform**: The original analytics platform from which data is being migrated (Segment, mParticle, etc.)
- **Destination Configuration**: Amplitude-specific settings that determine how data is received and processed
- **Event Tracking**: The process of capturing user interactions as discrete events
- **Identify Method**: Function used to associate user properties with a specific user ID
- **Group Method**: Function used to associate users with organizational entities
- **Data Model Mapping**: The process of translating concepts from source platforms to Amplitude equivalents
- **Backfill**: The process of importing historical data from previous platforms
- **Ingestion Debugger**: Tool for validating proper data flow into Amplitude
- **User Lookup**: Tool for verifying user identification in Amplitude
- **Tracking Plan**: Documentation of events, properties, and user attributes to be captured

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Migration Suite integrates with the broader Amplitude product ecosystem in several ways:

- **Amplitude CDP**: The migration tools feed data into Amplitude's Customer Data Platform for unified customer profiles
- **Amplitude Analytics**: Migrated event data becomes available for analysis in Amplitude's core analytics platform
- **Amplitude Browser/iOS/Android SDKs**: Migration paths provide implementation guidance for all major Amplitude SDKs
- **Amplitude Data Import APIs**: Used for historical data migration and backfilling

The Migration Suite serves as an onboarding bridge to the full Amplitude platform, ensuring that organizations can transition smoothly while preserving their analytics history and insights.

## Implementation Methods

The Migration Suite offers multiple implementation approaches:

1. **SDK Replacement**: Complete replacement of source platform SDKs with Amplitude equivalents
   - Browser: `amplitude.track("Event Name", {property: "value"})` replacing `analytics.track()`
   - iOS: `Amplitude.instance().logEvent("Event Name", withEventProperties: ["property": "value"])` 
   - Android: `Amplitude.getInstance().logEvent("Event Name", JSONObject properties)`

2. **Event Forwarding**: For platforms like GA4, a plugin-based approach that listens for events and forwards them to Amplitude
   - Example: `amplitudeGoogleAnalytics.init({apiKey: "YOUR_AMPLITUDE_API_KEY"})`

3. **Server-Side Implementation**: Options for server-side tracking conversion

4. **Tag Management Integration**: Guidance for implementing through tag management systems

## Validation and Troubleshooting

The Migration Suite includes several validation methods:

- **Ingestion Debugger**: Verifies events are being properly received
- **User Lookup**: Confirms user identification is working correctly
- **Event Comparison**: Tools to compare event volumes between platforms
- **Mixpanel Import Tool Troubleshooting**: Specific guidance for resolving issues with historical data imports
