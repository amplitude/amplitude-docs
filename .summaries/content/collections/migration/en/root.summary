# Amplitude Migration Guide

## Product Overview

Amplitude is an analytics platform that helps businesses track and analyze user behavior data. The migration documentation provides comprehensive guidance for transitioning from various analytics platforms to Amplitude, ensuring minimal disruption to data collection and analysis workflows. The product enables organizations to maintain data continuity while leveraging Amplitude's advanced analytics capabilities.

Key features of Amplitude include:
- Event-based tracking and analysis
- User identification and property tracking
- Cross-platform implementation (Browser, iOS, Android)
- Historical data backfilling capabilities
- Data validation tools
- Custom event property support
- Group analytics functionality

## Product Relationships and Features

The migration documentation covers transitions from five major analytics platforms:

1. **Adobe Analytics**: Focuses on mapping complex Adobe variables (eVars, props) to Amplitude's event-property model, with emphasis on data model differences and historical data backfilling.

2. **Google Analytics (GA4)**: Offers two migration approaches:
   - Low-code event forwarding plugin that listens for GA4 events
   - Complete replacement with direct Amplitude SDK implementation

3. **Mixpanel**: Provides industry-specific use cases and a dedicated Mixpanel import tool for historical data migration, with detailed taxonomy mapping.

4. **mParticle**: Emphasizes CDP (Customer Data Platform) integration and source/destination configuration, with platform-specific SDK implementation guidance.

5. **Segment**: Focuses on source/destination setup and method-by-method conversion of tracking calls across platforms.

Each migration path shares common elements while addressing platform-specific challenges:
- Implementation methodology
- Code conversion examples
- Data validation procedures
- Historical data migration options

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Event Tracking**: The core functionality of recording user actions within applications or websites.

2. **User Identification**: Methods for associating events with specific users:
   - `identify()` - Sets user properties
   - User ID - Unique identifier for users across sessions

3. **Event Properties**: Metadata associated with tracked events (equivalent to Adobe eVars, GA4 parameters, etc.)

4. **User Properties**: Attributes associated with users rather than individual events

5. **Group Analytics**: Functionality for analyzing user behavior at an organizational level

6. **Backfilling**: The process of importing historical data from previous analytics platforms

7. **Ingestion Debugger**: Tool for validating proper event tracking implementation

8. **User Lookup**: Feature for verifying user identification and properties

9. **Tracking Plan**: Documentation of events, properties, and implementation details

10. **Source/Destination Configuration**: Setup of data connections between platforms

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude functions as a comprehensive analytics platform that can:

1. **Replace existing analytics solutions** completely (as shown in the GA4 and Mixpanel migration paths)

2. **Integrate with Customer Data Platforms (CDPs)** like mParticle and Segment, either:
   - As a destination receiving data from these platforms
   - As a direct implementation replacing these platforms

3. **Complement existing data infrastructure** by:
   - Supporting historical data imports
   - Providing validation tools to ensure data consistency
   - Enabling report replication from previous platforms

The documentation suggests Amplitude can serve as a central analytics platform within a broader data ecosystem, with flexibility to adapt to various implementation approaches based on organizational needs.

## API Endpoints and Implementation Methods

The documentation references several implementation methods across platforms:

### Browser SDK Implementation
```javascript
// Amplitude initialization
amplitude.init('YOUR_API_KEY');

// Event tracking
amplitude.track('Event Name', {property1: 'value1'});

// User identification
amplitude.identify(new amplitude.Identify().set('user_property', 'value'));

// Group identification
amplitude.setGroup('group_type', 'group_name');
```

### iOS SDK Implementation
```swift
// Amplitude initialization
Amplitude.instance().initializeApiKey("YOUR_API_KEY")

// Event tracking
Amplitude.instance().logEvent("Event Name", withEventProperties: ["property1": "value1"])

// User identification
let identify = AMPIdentify()
identify.set("user_property", value: "value")
Amplitude.instance().identify(identify)

// Group identification
Amplitude.instance().setGroup("group_type", groupName: "group_name")
```

### Android SDK Implementation
```java
// Amplitude initialization
Amplitude.getInstance().initialize(getApplicationContext(), "YOUR_API_KEY");

// Event tracking
Amplitude.getInstance().logEvent("Event Name", new JSONObject().put("property1", "value1"));

// User identification
Identify identify = new Identify().set("user_property", "value");
Amplitude.getInstance().identify(identify);

// Group identification
Amplitude.getInstance().setGroup("group_type", "group_name");
```

### Data Import Tools
- **Mixpanel Import Tool**: Specialized tool for migrating historical Mixpanel data
- **BigQuery Import (Beta)**: For importing Google Analytics data from BigQuery

The documentation emphasizes validation through Amplitude's Ingestion Debugger and User Lookup tools to ensure proper implementation across all platforms.
