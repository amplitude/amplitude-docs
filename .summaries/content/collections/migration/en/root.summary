## Product Overview

Amplitude's Migration Documentation provides comprehensive guidance for transitioning from major analytics and customer data platforms to Amplitude's analytics and CDP (Customer Data Platform) ecosystem. The migration suite supports four primary source platforms: Adobe Analytics, Google Analytics (GA4), Mixpanel, and customer data platforms like mParticle and Segment. Each migration path addresses data model transformation, implementation methodology, historical data preservation, and validation processes.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

The migration documentation reveals a multi-layered product architecture centered around Amplitude's dual offerings: **Amplitude Analytics** for behavioral analytics and **Amplitude CDP** for customer data orchestration. The migration paths demonstrate how these products work together:

**Analytics-Focused Migrations** (Adobe Analytics, Google Analytics, Mixpanel) primarily target Amplitude Analytics with event-centric data models, while **CDP-Focused Migrations** (mParticle, Segment) emphasize Amplitude CDP's source/destination architecture for data routing and transformation.

The documentation shows integration touchpoints including SDK implementations across Browser SDK 2.0, iOS Swift SDK, and Android Kotlin SDK, unified tracking plans, and shared validation tools like the Ingestion Debugger and Event Explorer Chrome extension.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Data Model Concepts:**
- **Events**: Primary data unit in Amplitude's event-centric schema, replacing concepts like Adobe "hits" or GA4 "events"
- **Event Properties**: Contextual data attached to events, mapped from Adobe eVars/props or Mixpanel event properties
- **User Properties**: Persistent user attributes, derived from Adobe visitor variables or Mixpanel super properties
- **User ID/Device ID**: Identity resolution system replacing platform-specific identifiers

**Migration-Specific Terms:**
- **Batch Event Upload API**: Historical data ingestion mechanism for backfilling events
- **Solution Design Reference (SDR)**: Adobe-specific mapping document for variable translation
- **Write Key to API Key Migration**: Authentication credential transformation for CDP migrations
- **Event Forwarder**: Low-code plugin system for gradual migration (Google Analytics)

**Platform Architecture:**
- **Sources and Destinations**: CDP configuration for data ingestion and routing
- **Tracking Plans**: Schema management system using Ampli wrapper for type-safe implementation
- **Cohorts**: User segmentation replacing Adobe segments or similar grouping mechanisms

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The migration documentation reveals Amplitude's position as a comprehensive analytics and customer data platform ecosystem. The product architecture demonstrates several integration layers:

**Data Infrastructure Layer**: Amplitude CDP serves as a central data routing hub with configurable sources and destinations, supporting both first-party data collection and third-party integrations through tag management systems like Adobe Launch, Tealium, and Google Tag Manager.

**Analytics Layer**: Amplitude Analytics provides behavioral analysis capabilities that replicate and extend functionality from Adobe Analysis Workspace, Google Analytics reporting, and Mixpanel analytics through tools like Component Manager and Event Explorer.

**Implementation Layer**: Multi-platform SDK support (Browser, iOS, Android) with consistent API patterns across client-side and server-side implementations, supported by validation tools and debugging interfaces.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Primary APIs:**
- **Batch Event Upload API**: `/batch` endpoint for historical data migration and bulk event ingestion
- **User Privacy API**: Compliance and data management functionality
- **Mixpanel Export API Integration**: Direct data pipeline for Mixpanel historical data

**SDK Method Mappings:**
- Adobe: Custom event tracking → `amplitude.logEvent()`
- Google Analytics: `gtag('event')` → `amplitude.track()`
- Mixpanel: `mixpanel.track()` → `amplitude.logEvent()`, `mixpanel.register()` → `amplitude.identify()`
- Segment/mParticle: `track()` → `amplitude.track()`, `identify()` → `amplitude.identify()`

**Configuration Parameters:**
- Authentication: `write_key` (CDP) and `api_key` (Analytics) credential management
- Identity Resolution: `setUserId()`, `device_id` mapping, and user identification strategies
- Environment Management: Multi-environment configuration for development, staging, and production deployments

The migration suite positions Amplitude as a unified analytics and customer data platform capable of replacing multiple specialized tools while maintaining data continuity and expanding analytical capabilities.
