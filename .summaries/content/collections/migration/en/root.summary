## Amplitude Migration Documentation Suite

This documentation collection provides comprehensive migration pathways from major analytics and customer data platforms to Amplitude's analytics and CDP ecosystem. The suite covers four primary migration scenarios: Adobe Analytics, Google Analytics (GA4), Mixpanel, and mParticle/Segment, each offering detailed technical implementation guidance and data model transformation strategies.

## Product Relationships and Migration Architecture

The migration documentation follows a consistent three-tier approach across all platforms:

**Data Model Transformation Layer**: Each migration guide addresses the fundamental differences between source platform data models and Amplitude's event-centric architecture. Adobe's eVar/prop/success event structure, Google Analytics' dimension-based model, and Mixpanel's event tracking all require mapping to Amplitude's unified event schema with properties and user attributes.

**Implementation Migration Layer**: All guides provide dual implementation pathways - either through Amplitude's CDP (Customer Data Platform) as an intermediary layer, or direct SDK replacement. The CDP approach maintains existing instrumentation while routing data through Amplitude's infrastructure, while SDK replacement involves complete code migration to Amplitude's native tracking libraries.

**Validation and Quality Assurance Layer**: Each migration path includes comprehensive validation workflows using Amplitude's debugging ecosystem, including the Ingestion Debugger, User Lookup tools, Event Explorer Chrome extension, and real-time event validation capabilities.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Event-Centric Data Model**: Amplitude's core architectural principle where all user interactions are captured as discrete events with associated properties, contrasting with dimension-based models used by traditional web analytics platforms.

**SDK Implementation Patterns**: Standardized method signatures across platforms:
- `amplitude.track()` / `amplitude.logEvent()` for event tracking
- `amplitude.identify()` for user property assignment  
- `amplitude.init()` for SDK initialization with API keys
- `amplitude.setUserId()` for user identification

**Data Ingestion APIs**: 
- **Batch Event Upload API**: Primary method for historical data backfill and bulk data migration
- **Analytics HTTP v2 API**: Real-time event ingestion endpoint
- **Mixpanel Import Tool**: Dedicated migration utility for Mixpanel Export API integration

**Configuration Management**:
- **API Key vs App Key**: Platform-specific authentication tokens (mParticle uses app_key, others use API key)
- **Project vs Workspace**: Organizational hierarchy mapping between platforms
- **Sources and Destinations**: CDP configuration entities for data routing

## Ecosystem Integration and Platform Architecture

The migration suite reveals Amplitude's position as both an analytics destination and CDP hub within the broader martech ecosystem. The documentation demonstrates integration capabilities with:

**Tag Management Systems**: Adobe Launch extensions, Google Tag Manager templates, and Tealium integrations provide low-code implementation options while maintaining existing tag infrastructure.

**Customer Data Platforms**: Native integrations with Segment and mParticle allow gradual migration strategies where Amplitude can function as both a destination within existing CDP architectures and as a replacement CDP solution.

**Data Warehouse Integration**: Historical data migration capabilities through BigQuery Import (GA4 beta), Adobe Data Feeds processing, and direct API-based backfill methods enable comprehensive data continuity during platform transitions.

## Technical Implementation Specifications

**Multi-Platform SDK Support**: All migration paths include implementation examples for Browser SDK 2.0, iOS Swift SDK, and Android Kotlin SDK, ensuring consistent cross-platform tracking capabilities.

**Authentication and Configuration**:
- Adobe: Solution Design Reference (SDR) mapping and Adobe visitor ID preservation
- Google Analytics: Measurement ID forwarding and gtag compatibility
- Mixpanel: Service account authentication and GDPR compliance workflows
- Segment/mParticle: Write key to API key conversion and multi-environment deployment

**Validation Tools and Debugging**:
- **Ingestion Debugger**: Real-time event validation and troubleshooting
- **Event Explorer Chrome Extension**: Browser-based event inspection
- **User Lookup**: Individual user journey validation
- **Component Manager**: Adobe Analysis Workspace replication tool

The migration documentation positions Amplitude as a comprehensive analytics and CDP solution capable of replacing or augmenting existing analytics infrastructure while maintaining data continuity and expanding analytical capabilities through its event-centric architecture and integrated tooling ecosystem.
