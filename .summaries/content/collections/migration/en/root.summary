## Amplitude Migration Documentation Suite

This documentation collection provides comprehensive migration guides for transitioning from major analytics platforms to Amplitude's customer data platform (CDP) and analytics ecosystem. The guides cover four primary migration paths: Adobe Analytics, Google Analytics (GA4), Segment, and Mixpanel/mParticle.

## Product Relationships and Migration Architecture

The migration documentation follows a consistent three-phase approach across all platforms:

**Phase 1: Data Model Alignment** - Each guide addresses the fundamental differences between source platform data structures and Amplitude's event-centric schema. This includes mapping legacy constructs (Adobe's eVars/props, Mixpanel's super properties) to Amplitude's unified event and user property model.

**Phase 2: Implementation Migration** - All guides provide SDK-level implementation updates with code examples across Browser, iOS (Swift), and Android (Kotlin) platforms. The documentation emphasizes both client-side and server-side tracking capabilities.

**Phase 3: Historical Data Migration** - Each migration path includes strategies for backfilling historical data using Amplitude's Batch Event Upload API and platform-specific import tools.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Amplitude Concepts:**
- **Event-centric data model**: Amplitude's foundational approach where all user interactions are captured as discrete events with associated properties
- **Tracking Plan**: Amplitude's data governance framework for defining and validating event schemas
- **Ampli wrapper**: Type-safe SDK wrapper that enforces tracking plan compliance
- **User lookup**: Amplitude's user identification and resolution system

**Migration-Specific Terms:**
- **Solution Design Reference (SDR)**: Adobe Analytics documentation standard adapted for Amplitude migration planning
- **Component Manager**: Adobe Analytics tool for variable configuration mapping
- **Write_key to API_key migration**: Authentication credential transition from source platforms to Amplitude
- **Source/Destination configuration**: CDP architecture pattern for data routing and transformation

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The migration documentation integrates with several Amplitude ecosystem components:

**Data Infrastructure:**
- Amplitude CDP serves as the central data collection and routing layer
- Integration with cloud storage systems (Amazon S3) for bulk data import
- Support for data warehouse sources and BigQuery Import (GA4 beta)

**Tag Management Systems:**
- Native extensions for Adobe Launch, Tealium, and Google Tag Manager
- Low-code migration tools like the Google Analytics Event Forwarder plugin

**Validation and Debugging Tools:**
- Ingestion debugger for real-time data validation
- Event Explorer Chrome extension for implementation verification
- User Privacy API for compliance management

## API Endpoints and Implementation Methods

**Core SDK Methods:**
- `amplitude.track()` / `amplitude.logEvent()`: Primary event tracking
- `amplitude.identify()`: User property management
- `amplitude.setUserId()`: User identification
- `amplitude.groupIdentify()`: Group-level analytics

**Data Import APIs:**
- **Batch Event Upload API**: Historical data migration endpoint
- **Analytics HTTP v2 API**: Real-time event ingestion
- **Mixpanel Export API integration**: Direct historical data extraction
- **Adobe Data Feeds**: Bulk data export for migration

**Platform-Specific Integrations:**
- Adobe Launch extension for seamless tag management migration
- Mixpanel import tool with service account authentication
- BigQuery Import for GA4 data warehouse integration

The documentation emphasizes validation processes including Time to Live (TTL) configuration, device_id and user_id resolution, and comprehensive debugging workflows to ensure successful migration outcomes across all supported platforms.
