## Amplitude Migration Documentation Suite

This documentation collection provides comprehensive migration pathways from major analytics and customer data platforms to Amplitude's analytics and CDP ecosystem. The suite covers four primary migration scenarios: Adobe Analytics, Google Analytics (GA4), Mixpanel, and mParticle/Segment, each addressing distinct data model transformations and implementation strategies.

## Product Relationships and Migration Architecture

The migration documentation follows a consistent three-tier approach across all platforms:

**Data Model Transformation Layer**: Each migration guide addresses fundamental differences between source platform data structures and Amplitude's event-centric schema. Adobe Analytics requires mapping from eVars/props/success events to Amplitude events, while Google Analytics GA4 transitions from gtag-based tracking to Amplitude's event model. Mixpanel migrations involve converting super properties to user properties, and Segment/mParticle migrations focus on CDP-to-CDP data pipeline transitions.

**Implementation Layer**: All guides provide SDK-specific implementation patterns covering Browser SDK 2.0, iOS Swift SDK, and Android Kotlin SDK with direct code mapping examples (e.g., `mixpanel.track()` to `amplitude.logEvent()`, `gtag()` to `amplitude.track()`). Tag management system integrations are addressed through Adobe Launch extensions, Google Tag Manager templates, and Tealium configurations.

**Validation and Data Continuity Layer**: Each migration path includes validation tools (Ingestion Debugger, User Lookup, Event Explorer Chrome extension) and historical data backfill strategies using Batch Event Upload API and platform-specific export mechanisms.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Event-Centric Data Model**: Amplitude's core architectural principle where all user interactions are captured as discrete events with associated properties, contrasting with Adobe's variable-based model (eVars/props) and other platforms' mixed approaches.

**Tracking Plan**: Amplitude's schema governance system that replaces Adobe's Solution Design Reference (SDR) and provides structured event taxonomy management across all migration scenarios.

**User Identification Mapping**: Critical process for maintaining user continuity across platforms, involving device_id and user_id resolution, Adobe visitor ID mapping, and CDP identity graph preservation.

**Sources and Destinations**: Amplitude CDP terminology for data ingestion points (Sources) and data activation endpoints (Destinations), central to mParticle and Segment migration workflows.

**API Key vs Platform-Specific Keys**: Authentication token mapping from source platforms (write_key for Segment, app_key for mParticle, Measurement ID for GA4) to Amplitude's api_key system.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The migration suite positions Amplitude as a comprehensive analytics and CDP replacement capable of handling enterprise-scale data transitions. Integration touchpoints include:

**Customer Data Platform (CDP) Capabilities**: Direct competition with Segment and mParticle through native source/destination management, supporting multi-environment deployment patterns and maintaining existing data activation workflows.

**Enterprise Analytics Replacement**: Positioning against Adobe Analytics through Component Manager tool integration, Analysis Workspace replication capabilities, and enterprise data warehouse connectivity via Adobe Data Feeds backfill processes.

**Tag Management Ecosystem**: Native integrations with major tag management systems (Adobe Launch, Google Tag Manager, Tealium) enabling gradual migration strategies without complete implementation overhauls.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Batch Event Upload API**: Primary endpoint for historical data migration across all platforms, supporting bulk data transfer from Adobe Data Feeds, Mixpanel Export API, BigQuery exports, and CDP data exports.

**Analytics HTTP v2 API**: Core ingestion endpoint for real-time event streaming, replacing platform-specific APIs (Adobe Analytics Data Insertion API, GA4 Measurement Protocol, Mixpanel HTTP API).

**Mixpanel Import Tool**: Dedicated migration utility with service account authentication, GDPR compliance features, and Time to Live (TTL) configuration for automated historical data transfer.

**Google Analytics Event Forwarder Plugin**: Low-code migration tool enabling parallel data collection during transition periods, automatically forwarding GA4 events to Amplitude without code modifications.

The documentation suite emphasizes Professional Services support for complex enterprise migrations, multi-platform data validation processes, and comprehensive testing frameworks to ensure data integrity throughout migration processes.
