## Product Overview

Amplitude's Migration Documentation provides comprehensive guidance for transitioning from major analytics and customer data platforms to Amplitude's analytics and CDP (Customer Data Platform) ecosystem. The migration suite supports transitions from Adobe Analytics, Google Analytics (GA4), Mixpanel, mParticle, and Segment, offering both low-code automated solutions and complete implementation replacement strategies.

## Product Relationships and Features

The migration documentation centers around two core Amplitude products:

**Amplitude Analytics Platform**: The primary destination for analytics migrations, featuring an event-centric data model that contrasts with traditional page-view or session-based tracking. This platform includes specialized tools like the Ingestion Debugger, User Lookup validation, Event Explorer Chrome extension, and Component Manager for replicating analysis workflows.

**Amplitude CDP (Customer Data Platform)**: The target for customer data platform migrations, providing Sources and Destinations architecture that replaces traditional tag management and data routing systems. The CDP integrates with Amplitude's analytics while maintaining independent data flow capabilities.

The migration paths utilize Amplitude's SDK ecosystem across multiple platforms:
- Browser SDK 2.0 with specialized plugins (Google Analytics Event Forwarder)
- iOS Swift SDK for native mobile implementations  
- Android Kotlin SDK for Android applications
- Server-side APIs including the Batch Event Upload API for historical data migration

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Data Model Transformation**: The migration process fundamentally shifts from platform-specific schemas to Amplitude's event-centric model. Adobe's eVars, props, and success events convert to Amplitude events and properties. Google Analytics' gtag events map to amplitude.track() calls. Mixpanel's mixpanel.track() becomes amplitude.logEvent().

**User Identity Resolution**: Critical mapping concepts include device_id and user_id resolution, visitor ID mapping from Adobe, and user identification migration across platforms. The setUserId() method standardizes user tracking across migrated implementations.

**Configuration Architecture**: 
- **Sources and Destinations**: Amplitude CDP's data routing framework replacing traditional integrations
- **Tracking Plans**: Amplitude's schema validation system for maintaining data quality
- **Solution Design Reference (SDR)**: Documentation framework for mapping legacy analytics implementations

**Migration Methods**:
- **Low-code Migration**: Automated forwarding solutions like the Google Analytics Event Forwarder plugin
- **Complete Replacement**: Full SDK implementation with code-level changes
- **Historical Backfill**: Batch data migration using Export APIs and Batch Event Upload API

## Ecosystem Integration

The migration documentation positions Amplitude as a comprehensive replacement for fragmented analytics and CDP ecosystems. The platform integrates with existing tag management systems (Adobe Launch, Tealium, Google Tag Manager) during transition periods while providing native alternatives through Amplitude's CDP.

Professional Services support complex enterprise migrations, particularly for historical data migration and GDPR compliance requirements. The ecosystem supports multi-environment deployment patterns with workspace and project mapping from legacy platforms.

## Technical Implementation

**API Endpoints and Methods**:
- `amplitude.track()` - Primary event tracking method replacing platform-specific calls
- `amplitude.identify()` - User property management replacing mixpanel.register() and similar methods
- `amplitude.logEvent()` - Event logging for mobile implementations
- `groupIdentify()` - Group-level property management for B2B use cases
- Batch Event Upload API - Historical data migration endpoint

**Authentication and Configuration**:
- API key management replacing write_key (Segment) and app_key configurations
- Service account authentication for data export processes
- Measurement ID tracking for Google Analytics transitions

**Validation Tools**:
- Ingestion Debugger for real-time data validation
- Event Explorer Chrome extension for implementation testing
- User Lookup for identity resolution verification
- Component Manager for analysis workflow migration

The migration suite includes specialized import tools (Mixpanel import tool) and supports BigQuery Import for GA4 data (beta), providing multiple pathways for data transition based on technical requirements and organizational constraints.
