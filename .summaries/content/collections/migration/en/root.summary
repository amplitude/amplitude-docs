# Amplitude Migration Guide: Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude is an analytics platform that helps businesses track and analyze user behavior across digital products. The migration documentation provides comprehensive guidance for transitioning from various analytics platforms to Amplitude with minimal disruption to data collection and analysis workflows.

### Key Features
- Cross-platform event tracking and user identification
- Customizable data taxonomy and schema mapping
- Historical data backfilling capabilities
- Data validation tools including Ingestion Debugger and User Lookup
- Support for both client-side and server-side implementation
- Integration with tag management systems
- Group tracking functionality for B2B analytics

### Primary Use Cases
- Converting existing analytics implementations to Amplitude
- Maintaining data continuity during platform transitions
- Replicating existing reports and metrics in Amplitude
- Ensuring consistent user identification across platforms
- Implementing industry-specific analytics use cases

## Product Relationships and Features

The migration documentation covers transitions from five major analytics platforms:

1. **Adobe Analytics Migration**: Focuses on mapping complex Adobe variables (eVars, props) to Amplitude's event-property model, with emphasis on data model differences and historical data backfilling.

2. **Google Analytics Migration**: Offers two approaches:
   - Low-code event forwarding plugin that listens for GA4 events
   - Complete replacement with SDK implementation
   - Also includes BigQuery Import beta for historical data

3. **Mixpanel Migration**: Provides industry-specific use case recommendations, taxonomy mapping, and a dedicated Mixpanel import tool for historical data.

4. **mParticle Migration**: Emphasizes CDP (Customer Data Platform) integration, source/destination configuration, and SDK implementation updates.

5. **Segment Migration**: Details source/destination setup and method-by-method conversion of tracking code.

Each migration path follows a similar structure but addresses platform-specific challenges and conversion patterns.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event Tracking**: The core functionality of capturing user interactions, with different implementation methods across platforms
- **User Identification**: Methods for associating events with specific users (varies by platform)
- **Group Tracking**: B2B functionality for associating users with organizations or accounts
- **Properties/Parameters**: Key-value pairs attached to events providing context
- **Backfilling**: Process of importing historical data from previous platform
- **Source/Destination Configuration**: Setup of data connections between platforms
- **SDK Implementation**: Client-side code for tracking events directly
- **Data Validation**: Process of verifying correct data collection after migration

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude functions as a comprehensive analytics platform that can:

1. Receive data from multiple sources:
   - Direct SDK implementations (Browser, iOS, Android)
   - CDPs like Segment and mParticle
   - Server-side implementations
   - Tag management systems
   - Historical data imports

2. Integrate with the broader data ecosystem:
   - Functions as a destination for data from other platforms
   - Can serve as a primary or supplementary analytics solution
   - Supports various implementation methods to fit existing tech stacks

## Implementation Methods

### SDK Implementations
Amplitude provides SDKs for multiple platforms with similar method signatures:

**Browser SDK Example:**
```javascript
// Initialize
amplitude.init('YOUR_API_KEY');

// Track events
amplitude.track('Event Name', {property1: 'value1'});

// Identify users
amplitude.identify(new amplitude.Identify().set('user_property', 'value'));

// Group tracking
amplitude.setGroup('group_type', 'group_name');
```

**iOS SDK Example:**
```swift
// Initialize
Amplitude.instance().initializeApiKey("YOUR_API_KEY")

// Track events
Amplitude.instance().logEvent("Event Name", withEventProperties: ["property1": "value1"])

// Identify users
let identify = AMPIdentify()
identify.set("user_property", value: "value")
Amplitude.instance().identify(identify)

// Group tracking
Amplitude.instance().setGroup("group_type", groupName: "group_name")
```

**Android SDK Example:**
```java
// Initialize
Amplitude.getInstance().initialize(this, "YOUR_API_KEY");

// Track events
Amplitude.getInstance().logEvent("Event Name", new JSONObject().put("property1", "value1"));

// Identify users
Identify identify = new Identify().set("user_property", "value");
Amplitude.getInstance().identify(identify);

// Group tracking
Amplitude.getInstance().setGroup("group_type", "group_name");
```

### Migration Tools and Utilities
- **Ingestion Debugger**: Validates proper event tracking implementation
- **User Lookup**: Verifies user identification across platforms
- **Mixpanel Import Tool**: Specialized tool for Mixpanel historical data
- **BigQuery Import Beta**: For Google Analytics historical data
- **GA4 Event Forwarding Plugin**: Low-code solution for GA4 migration

The migration documentation emphasizes a methodical approach to platform transitions, focusing on maintaining data continuity, proper event mapping, and validation to ensure analytics capabilities remain intact throughout the migration process.
