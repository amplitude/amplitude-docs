# Amplitude Migration Guide: Comprehensive Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude is an analytics platform that helps businesses track and analyze user behavior data. The migration documentation provides comprehensive guidance for transitioning from various analytics platforms (Adobe Analytics, Google Analytics, Mixpanel, mParticle, and Segment) to Amplitude. The migration guides focus on preserving data continuity, mapping existing tracking implementations, and ensuring proper validation of the migrated data.

## Key Features and Concepts

1. **Cross-Platform Migration Support**: Detailed migration paths from major analytics platforms including Adobe Analytics, Google Analytics (GA4), Mixpanel, mParticle, and Segment.

2. **Multiple Migration Approaches**: Options for both low-code/no-code migrations (like event forwarding plugins) and complete SDK replacements with custom implementation.

3. **Historical Data Migration**: Methods to backfill historical data from previous platforms to maintain continuity in reporting.

4. **Data Validation Tools**: Built-in validation mechanisms like Ingestion Debugger and User Lookup to verify correct data migration.

5. **SDK Implementation**: Cross-platform SDK support for Browser, iOS, and Android with specific code examples for each migration path.

6. **Data Taxonomy Mapping**: Detailed guidance on mapping existing data models to Amplitude's event-based schema.

## Product Relationships and Features

### Migration Pathways

1. **Adobe Analytics to Amplitude**:
   - Focuses on mapping Adobe's complex variable system (eVars, props) to Amplitude's event properties
   - Provides strategies for both client-side and server-side implementation
   - Includes report replication guidance to recreate existing Adobe reports in Amplitude

2. **Google Analytics (GA4) to Amplitude**:
   - Offers a low-code Google Analytics event forwarding plugin
   - Provides a BigQuery Import beta option
   - Includes complete code replacement examples for converting gtag functions to Amplitude SDK calls

3. **Mixpanel to Amplitude**:
   - Features a dedicated Mixpanel import tool for historical data
   - Provides industry-specific use case recommendations
   - Includes detailed method mapping between platforms

4. **mParticle to Amplitude**:
   - Focuses on source/destination configuration
   - Provides detailed SDK implementation conversion examples
   - Includes user identity mapping guidance

5. **Segment to Amplitude**:
   - Covers source/destination configuration
   - Provides detailed method conversion examples (identify, track, group)
   - Includes cross-platform SDK implementation guidance

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Event Properties**: Amplitude's equivalent to contextual data points that might be called eVars in Adobe or custom dimensions in Google Analytics.

2. **User Properties**: Persistent attributes associated with a user that persist across sessions.

3. **Identify Method**: Function used to associate events with specific user identities.

4. **Track Method**: Primary function used to record events in Amplitude.

5. **Group Method**: Function used to associate users with organizational entities.

6. **Ingestion Debugger**: Amplitude tool for validating proper event tracking implementation.

7. **User Lookup**: Amplitude tool for verifying user identity and associated events.

8. **Tracking Plan**: Documentation that outlines the events, properties, and user attributes to be tracked.

9. **Backfill**: Process of importing historical data from a previous analytics platform.

10. **Data Taxonomy**: The organizational structure of events, properties, and user attributes.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude functions as a comprehensive analytics platform that can receive data from multiple sources:

1. **Direct SDK Implementation**: Native Amplitude SDKs for Browser, iOS, and Android platforms.

2. **CDP Integration**: Functions alongside Customer Data Platforms like Segment and mParticle.

3. **Tag Management Systems**: Compatible with tag managers mentioned in the Adobe migration documentation.

4. **Server-Side Sources**: Ability to receive data from server-side implementations.

5. **Data Import Tools**: Specialized tools for importing historical data from other platforms.

## API and Implementation Examples

### Browser SDK Implementation

```javascript
// Initializing Amplitude
amplitude.init('YOUR_API_KEY');

// Tracking an event
amplitude.track('Button Clicked', {
  buttonColor: 'blue',
  buttonText: 'Submit'
});

// Identifying a user
amplitude.identify(new amplitude.Identify()
  .set('email', 'user@example.com')
  .set('plan', 'premium'));
```

### iOS SDK Implementation

```swift
// Initializing Amplitude
Amplitude.instance().initializeApiKey("YOUR_API_KEY")

// Tracking an event
Amplitude.instance().logEvent("Button Clicked", withEventProperties: [
  "buttonColor": "blue",
  "buttonText": "Submit"
])

// Identifying a user
let identify = AMPIdentify()
identify.set("email", value: "user@example.com")
identify.set("plan", value: "premium")
Amplitude.instance().identify(identify)
```

### Android SDK Implementation

```java
// Initializing Amplitude
Amplitude.getInstance().initialize(getApplicationContext(), "YOUR_API_KEY");

// Tracking an event
JSONObject eventProperties = new JSONObject();
eventProperties.put("buttonColor", "blue");
eventProperties.put("buttonText", "Submit");
Amplitude.getInstance().logEvent("Button Clicked", eventProperties);

// Identifying a user
Identify identify = new Identify()
  .set("email", "user@example.com")
  .set("plan", "premium");
Amplitude.getInstance().identify(identify);
```

The migration guides provide specific implementation details for converting from each source platform to these Amplitude equivalents, ensuring a smooth transition while maintaining data integrity and reporting continuity.
