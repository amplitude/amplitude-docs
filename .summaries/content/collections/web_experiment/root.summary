Amplitude Web Experimentation is a comprehensive A/B testing and experimentation platform that enables teams to run client-side experiments without requiring code changes. The platform centers around a Visual Editor that allows users to create and modify website elements through a point-and-click interface, while also supporting advanced custom code implementations for complex use cases.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Web Experimentation platform operates through several interconnected components:

**Core Implementation Layer**: The foundation consists of a standalone JavaScript script (79KB base + ~1KB per flag) that can be implemented synchronously or asynchronously. The script includes anti-flicker functionality to prevent visual inconsistencies during experiment loading and supports both US (`cdn.amplitude.com`) and EU (`cdn.eu.amplitude.com`) data center endpoints.

**Experiment Configuration**: Experiments are structured around three primary components that work together:
- **Pages**: Define URL targeting rules and variant scoping using operators like URL Matches Exactly, URL Contains, URL Starts With, and URL Matches Regex
- **Actions**: Specify how variants modify websites through element changes, URL redirects, or custom code injection
- **Targeting**: Control audience selection through browser properties (evaluated locally) and user properties (evaluated remotely)

**Visual Editor Integration**: The Visual Editor serves as the primary interface for creating experiments, allowing users to modify CSS properties, edit HTML content, and configure element selectors without technical expertise. It integrates directly with the Pages functionality for URL preview and targeting configuration.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Variants**: Different versions of a webpage or experience being tested, each containing specific actions that modify the original page

**Actions**: The specific modifications applied by variants, categorized into:
- Element changes (display, visibility, text, background, positioning)
- URL redirects with query parameter retention
- Custom code actions (JavaScript, CSS, HTML injection)

**Bucketing**: The process of assigning users to experiment variants based on rollout percentages and distribution settings

**Impression Events**: Tracking events fired when users are exposed to experiment variants, transformed from `$impression` to `[Experiment] Impression` format with flag_key and variant properties

**Anti-flicker Overlay**: A mechanism that prevents visual inconsistencies during experiment loading, with a 1-second timeout for remote property evaluation

**Page Targeting Rules**: Conditions that determine which URLs an experiment should run on, using various matching operators for precise control

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Web Experimentation integrates extensively with Amplitude's analytics ecosystem and third-party platforms:

**Amplitude Integration**: Native integration with Amplitude's Browser SDK for user identification, behavioral cohorts, and analytics. Uses Device ID consistency and Amplitude ID resolution for user tracking across sessions.

**Third-Party CDP Integration**: Supports integration with customer data platforms through:
- Segment integration via query parameters
- Tealium iQ and AudienceStream compatibility
- Custom IntegrationPlugin interface for bespoke integrations
- `experimentIntegration` window variable for custom implementations

**Content Management Systems**: Dedicated plugins available for WordPress and Shopify platforms, enabling easy implementation without manual code changes.

**Tag Management**: Compatible with Google Tag Manager through custom HTML tags, allowing marketing teams to deploy experiments without developer involvement.

## Technical Implementation Details

**Script Loading**: Multiple implementation options including synchronous loading with anti-flicker snippets, asynchronous loading for performance optimization, and Content Security Policy considerations requiring `script-src` and `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: unsafe-none` headers.

**Performance Characteristics**: 
- Dynamic script sizing based on active experiments
- Two-layer CDN and browser caching with 60-second max-age and stale-while-revalidate policies
- Synchronous local evaluation (<1ms for browser properties)
- CPU-bound evaluation for variant actions

**Utility Functions**: Built-in JavaScript utilities including:
- `waitForElement()` for DOM manipulation timing
- `utils.remove()` for cleanup operations
- MutationObserver integration for single-page application support

**API and Tracking**: 
- Impression volume estimation: MTU × experiments × page views per month
- Event transformation pipeline from internal `$impression` events to standardized `[Experiment] Impression` format
- User property setting for experiment analysis and segmentation

**Post-Experiment Workflow**: Structured process for experiment conclusion including statistical significance analysis, winning variant migration to production codebases, experiment deactivation, and technical debt cleanup to reduce client-side overhead and impression volume costs.

The platform is available on Growth and Enterprise plans, with certain advanced features like custom code actions and Management API access restricted to higher-tier subscriptions.
