# Web Experiment Product Overview

Web Experiment is an Amplitude product that enables non-technical users to create and run A/B tests on websites through a visual interface without requiring coding skills. It allows users to create website variants, target specific pages and audiences, and analyze experiment results to make data-driven decisions.

## Key Features and Capabilities

- **Visual Editor**: WYSIWYG interface for modifying website elements without coding knowledge
- **Element Modifications**: Ability to change display properties, visibility, text content, background, and positioning
- **Custom Code Actions**: Support for injecting JavaScript, HTML, and CSS into variants
- **URL Redirects**: Capability to redirect users to different URLs as part of experiments
- **Targeting Options**: Page-level targeting via URL matching and audience targeting based on user properties
- **Anti-flicker Technology**: Prevents visual flickering during experiment loading
- **Performance Optimization**: Minimal impact with two-layer caching (CDN and browser)
- **Third-party Integration**: Support for CDPs, CMSs, and tag managers

## Product Relationships and Architecture

Web Experiment is integrated within the Amplitude ecosystem:

1. **Amplitude Experiment**: Web Experiment is a component of Amplitude's broader experimentation platform
2. **Amplitude Analytics**: Experiment impressions are automatically tracked as events (`[Experiment] Impression`)
3. **Flag Evaluation System**: Uses Amplitude's flag evaluation to determine which variant to show users
4. **Visual Editor**: Provides the no-code interface within the Amplitude platform

The implementation workflow consists of:
1. Adding the Web Experiment script to a website
2. Creating experiments with variants using the Visual Editor
3. Configuring targeting rules for pages and audiences
4. Launching the experiment
5. Analyzing results
6. Implementing winning variants in production code

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Variant**: A modified version of a webpage created for testing against the original
- **Flag Key**: Unique identifier for an experiment
- **Impression**: An event recorded when a user sees an experiment variant
- **Bucketing**: The process of assigning users to specific variants based on distribution settings
- **Anti-flicker Snippet**: Code that prevents visual flickering during experiment loading
- **Page Targeting**: Rules that determine which pages an experiment runs on
- **Audience Targeting**: Rules that determine which users see an experiment
- **Rollout Percentage**: The portion of users included in an experiment
- **Variant Distribution**: How users are allocated across different variants

## Integration with Product Ecosystem

Web Experiment functions within Amplitude's experimentation and analytics platform:

1. **Experiment Creation**: Experiments are created in the Amplitude interface
2. **Data Collection**: Impression events are automatically sent to Amplitude Analytics
3. **Analysis**: Results are analyzed using Amplitude's analytics capabilities
4. **User Properties**: Experiment participation is stored as user properties for segmentation
5. **Third-party Integrations**: Supports integration with Segment, Tealium, and other CDPs
6. **CMS Support**: Dedicated plugins for WordPress and implementation guides for Shopify

## Technical Implementation

### Script Implementation

```html
<!-- Synchronous implementation -->
<script src="https://cdn.experiment.amplitude.com/experiment.js"></script>
<script>
  experiment.initiate({
    apiKey: 'YOUR-API-KEY',
    // Optional configuration
  });
</script>

<!-- Asynchronous implementation with anti-flicker -->
<script>
  !function(){var e=document.createElement("style");e.textContent=":root{opacity:0;transition:opacity 0.5s;}";document.head.appendChild(e);window.setTimeout(function(){document.documentElement.style.opacity="1"},500)}();
</script>
<script async src="https://cdn.experiment.amplitude.com/experiment.js"></script>
<script>
  window.experimentConfig = {
    apiKey: 'YOUR-API-KEY',
    // Optional configuration
  };
</script>
```

### Utility Functions

The product provides utility functions for dynamic page modifications:

```javascript
// Wait for an element to appear in the DOM
experiment.utils.waitForElement('.selector', (element) => {
  // Modify the element
});

// Remove an element
experiment.utils.remove('.selector');
```

### Event Tracking

Impression events include the following properties:
- `flag_key`: The experiment identifier
- `variant`: The variant the user is seeing
- `experiment_key`: The experiment name
- `$impression`: Set to true for impression events

## Post-Experiment Workflow

After an experiment concludes:
1. Analyze results to determine the winning variant
2. Implement the winning variant in production code
3. Deactivate the experiment in Amplitude
4. Document the experiment results and implementation details
5. Remove the experiment from the Web Experiment configuration to reduce technical debt

The documentation emphasizes that experiments should not be left running at 100% allocation indefinitely, as this impacts performance and creates technical debt.
