# Summary
Web Experiment is designed for minimal performance impact with a dynamic script (20KB compressed base size plus ~100B per flag) that uses two-layer caching (CDN and browser) and fast local evaluation (<1ms). The feature includes considerations for script size management, caching configurations, and limitations with ad blockers.
