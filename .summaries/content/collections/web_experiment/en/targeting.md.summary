## Summary
This documentation details Web Experiment targeting capabilities, explaining how Amplitude evaluates page targeting (using URL matching operators) before audience targeting, with both evaluated locally in the browser at page load. It describes various targeting methods including browser properties (local) and user properties (remote), along with bucketing mechanisms that determine which variant users see based on rollout percentages and distribution settings.
