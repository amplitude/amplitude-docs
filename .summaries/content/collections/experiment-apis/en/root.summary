# Amplitude Experiment: A Comprehensive Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude Experiment is a feature experimentation and feature flag management platform that enables product teams to test hypotheses, roll out features safely, and make data-driven decisions. The platform provides robust capabilities for creating and managing experiments, feature flags, deployments, and specialized configurations like holdout groups and mutex groups.

Key features include:
- Remote and local evaluation of experiments and feature flags
- Comprehensive management APIs for all platform components
- Variant assignment and user targeting
- Traffic allocation and bucketing configuration
- Deployment management across environments
- Version history tracking

## Product Architecture and Relationships

Amplitude Experiment consists of several interconnected components:

1. **Experiments** - Controlled tests that compare variants of a feature to determine which performs better based on defined metrics.

2. **Feature Flags** - Toggles that enable/disable features or control which variant of a feature users see.

3. **Deployments** - Environments (client/server) where experiments and flags are implemented, each with its own deployment key.

4. **Holdout Groups** - Special configurations that exclude users from experiments to measure the overall impact of experimentation.

5. **Mutex Groups** - Mechanisms to ensure users aren't assigned to multiple conflicting experiments simultaneously.

6. **Versions** - Historical records of configuration changes to experiments and flags.

The platform offers two primary evaluation methods:
- **Remote Evaluation** - Server-side evaluation where Amplitude assigns variants and tracks events
- **Local Evaluation** - Client-side evaluation where applications download flag configurations and perform assignments locally

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Variant**: A specific version of a feature being tested in an experiment or controlled by a flag
- **Deployment Key**: Authentication credential used for evaluation API requests
- **Management API Key**: Authentication credential for the management APIs
- **Bucketing Configuration**: Settings that determine how users are assigned to variants
- **Bucketing Key**: The user property used to determine variant assignment (e.g., user_id, device_id)
- **Evaluation Mode**: Determines how variants are assigned (e.g., local vs. remote)
- **Rollout Percentage**: Controls what percentage of users are included in an experiment
- **Individual Inclusion/Exclusion**: Explicit lists of users to include or exclude from experiments
- **Targeting Segments**: Conditions that determine which users are eligible for an experiment
- **Slots**: Divisions within mutex groups that control traffic allocation
- **Holdout Percentage**: Portion of users excluded from experiments to measure overall impact

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Experiment integrates with the broader Amplitude Analytics ecosystem, allowing teams to:
1. Use analytics data to inform experiment targeting
2. Measure experiment results using analytics events
3. Make data-driven decisions based on experiment outcomes

The platform supports both client-side and server-side implementations, with appropriate deployment types and evaluation methods for each use case.

## API Endpoints

### Evaluation APIs
- **Remote Evaluation API**: `GET /api/2/flags/evaluate`
  - Retrieves variant assignments for users
  - Requires deployment key authentication
  - Tracks assignment events

- **Flags API**: `GET /api/2/flags`
  - Downloads flag configurations for local evaluation
  - Requires deployment key authentication

### Management APIs

1. **Experiment Endpoints**:
   - `GET /experiments` - List experiments
   - `GET /experiments/{id}` - Get experiment details
   - `POST /experiments` - Create experiment
   - `PATCH /experiments/{id}` - Edit experiment
   - Additional endpoints for managing variants, deployments, and user inclusions

2. **Flag Endpoints**:
   - `GET /flags` - List flags
   - `GET /flags/{key}` - Get flag details
   - `POST /flags` - Create flag
   - `PATCH /flags/{key}` - Edit flag
   - Additional endpoints for managing variants, deployments, and user inclusions

3. **Deployment Endpoints**:
   - `GET /deployments` - List deployments
   - `POST /deployments` - Create deployment
   - `PATCH /deployments/{id}` - Edit deployment

4. **Holdout Group Endpoints**:
   - `GET /holdouts` - List holdout groups
   - `GET /holdouts/{id}` - Get holdout details
   - `POST /holdouts` - Create holdout group

All Management API endpoints require authentication using a management API key in the Authorization header and are subject to rate limiting.
