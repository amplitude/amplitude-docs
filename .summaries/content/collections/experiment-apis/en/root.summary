# Amplitude Experiment: Product Overview

Amplitude Experiment is a comprehensive experimentation and feature flagging platform that enables product teams to test hypotheses, roll out features safely, and make data-driven decisions. The platform provides robust APIs for managing and evaluating experiments and feature flags across client and server environments.

## Key Features and Concepts

1. **Feature Flags**: Toggle features on/off for specific users or segments
2. **Experiments**: Test hypotheses by comparing variants against control groups
3. **Deployments**: Environment configurations where experiments and flags are deployed
4. **Holdout Groups**: Control groups excluded from experiments
5. **Mutex Groups**: Mechanisms to prevent users from participating in multiple experiments simultaneously
6. **Remote and Local Evaluation**: Options for determining variant assignments
7. **User Targeting**: Inclusion/exclusion of specific users or segments
8. **Variant Management**: Define different versions of features with custom payloads

## Product Architecture and Relationships

Amplitude Experiment consists of two primary API categories:

1. **Experiment Management API**: For creating and configuring experiments, flags, and related resources
2. **Experiment Evaluation API**: For determining which variant a user should receive

The platform organizes resources hierarchically:
- **Projects** contain multiple experiments, flags, and configurations
- **Deployments** represent environments (e.g., development, staging, production)
- **Experiments and Flags** are assigned to deployments
- **Variants** belong to experiments or flags
- **Mutex Groups** and **Holdout Groups** coordinate across experiments

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Flag**: A feature toggle that can be turned on/off for specific users
- **Experiment**: A controlled test comparing different variants
- **Variant**: A specific version of a feature being tested
- **Deployment**: An environment configuration (client-side or server-side)
- **Deployment Key**: Authentication credential for evaluation APIs
- **Management API Key**: Authentication credential for management APIs
- **Bucketing**: The process of assigning users to variants
- **Bucketing Key**: The user property used for consistent variant assignment
- **Evaluation Mode**: How variant assignments are determined (local or remote)
- **Holdout Group**: Users excluded from experiments for control purposes
- **Mutex Group**: Configuration ensuring users only participate in one experiment at a time
- **Slot**: A portion of traffic allocation within a mutex group
- **User Context**: User identifiers and properties used for targeting
- **Sticky Bucketing**: Ensuring users consistently receive the same variant

## API Endpoints

## Integration with Amplitude Ecosystem

Amplitude Experiment integrates with the broader Amplitude product ecosystem, particularly with Amplitude Analytics. This integration enables:

1. Using Amplitude user properties and segments for targeting
2. Analyzing experiment results using Amplitude Analytics
3. Making data-driven decisions based on user behavior metrics

The platform supports both client-side and server-side implementations, with SDKs available for various platforms and languages to facilitate integration into different application environments.
