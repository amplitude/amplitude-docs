# Amplitude Experiment: Product Overview

Amplitude Experiment is a feature experimentation and feature flag management platform that enables product teams to test new features, control feature rollouts, and make data-driven decisions. The platform provides comprehensive APIs for managing and evaluating experiments and feature flags.

## Key Features and Concepts

1. **Feature Flags**: Toggle features on/off or serve different variants to different users
2. **Experiments**: Test different variants of features to measure their impact
3. **Deployments**: Environments where experiments and flags can be deployed
4. **Holdout Groups**: Control groups excluded from experiments
5. **Mutex Groups**: Ensure users only participate in one experiment at a time
6. **Remote and Local Evaluation**: Options for determining which variant a user receives
7. **User Targeting**: Target specific user segments for experiments or flags
8. **Version History**: Track changes to experiments and flags over time

## Product Relationships and Architecture

Amplitude Experiment consists of two primary API categories:

1. **Experiment Management API**: Used to create and manage experiments, flags, deployments, and other configuration elements
2. **Experiment Evaluation API**: Used to evaluate which variant a user should receive

The platform supports both server-side and client-side implementations through different deployment types. Experiments and flags can be assigned to specific deployments, allowing for environment-specific configurations.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Experiment**: A test comparing different variants of a feature
- **Flag**: A feature toggle that can be turned on/off or serve different variants
- **Variant**: A specific version or implementation of a feature
- **Deployment**: An environment (client/server) where experiments or flags are active
- **Holdout Group**: A control group excluded from experiments
- **Mutex Group**: A mechanism to prevent users from being in multiple experiments simultaneously
- **Slots**: Divisions within mutex groups for traffic allocation
- **Bucketing**: The process of assigning users to variants based on user properties
- **Evaluation Mode**: How variant assignments are determined (local or remote)
- **User Context**: Information about the user for variant assignment decisions

## API Endpoints

### Experiment Evaluation API

1. **Evaluation API** (`POST /sdk/<deploymentKey>/evaluate`):
   - Retrieves variant assignments for users
   - Tracks assignment events
   - Requires deployment key authentication

2. **Flags API** (`GET /sdk/<deploymentKey>/flags`):
   - Downloads flag configurations for local evaluations
   - Supports filtering by flag keys

### Experiment Management API

1. **Experiment Endpoints**:
   - `GET /experiments`: List experiments
   - `GET /experiments/{id}`: Get experiment details
   - `POST /experiments`: Create experiment
   - `PATCH /experiments/{id}`: Edit experiment
   - Additional endpoints for managing variants, deployments, and user inclusions

2. **Flag Endpoints**:
   - `GET /flags`: List flags
   - `GET /flags/{id}`: Get flag details
   - `POST /flags`: Create flag
   - `PATCH /flags/{id}`: Edit flag
   - Additional endpoints for managing variants, deployments, and user inclusions

3. **Deployment Endpoints**:
   - `GET /deployments`: List deployments
   - `POST /deployments`: Create deployment
   - `PATCH /deployments/{id}`: Edit deployment

4. **Holdout Group Endpoints**:
   - `GET /holdouts`: List holdout groups
   - `GET /holdouts/{id}`: Get holdout details
   - `POST /holdouts`: Create holdout group
   - `PATCH /holdouts/{id}`: Edit holdout group

5. **Mutex Group Endpoints**:
   - `GET /mutexes`: List mutex groups
   - `GET /mutexes/{id}`: Get mutex details
   - `POST /mutexes`: Create mutex group
   - `PATCH /mutexes/{id}`: Edit mutex group

6. **Version Endpoints**:
   - `GET /versions`: Retrieve version history of experiments and flags

## Authentication and Usage

- **Management API**: Uses API keys in the Authorization header
- **Evaluation API**: Uses deployment keys for authentication
- Regional endpoints are available for different data residency requirements
- Rate limiting applies to API requests
- Pagination is implemented using cursor-based navigation

The Amplitude Experiment platform integrates with the broader Amplitude Analytics ecosystem, allowing for data-driven experimentation and feature rollout decisions based on user behavior analytics.
