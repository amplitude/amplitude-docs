# Summary
The Experiment Evaluation API documentation describes two key endpoints: the Evaluation API for retrieving variant assignments for users through remote evaluation (tracking assignment events), and the Flags API for downloading flag configurations for local evaluations, both requiring deployment key authentication and supporting various query parameters for user identification and flag selection.
