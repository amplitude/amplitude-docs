# Amplitude Experiment: Product Overview

Amplitude Experiment is a comprehensive experimentation and feature flagging platform that enables product teams to test hypotheses, roll out features safely, and make data-driven decisions. The platform combines feature flagging, A/B testing, and holdout capabilities with robust management and evaluation APIs.

## Key Features and Concepts

- **Feature Flags**: Toggle features on/off or serve different variants to different users
- **Experiments**: Test hypotheses by comparing different variants against control groups
- **Deployments**: Configuration environments (client-side or server-side) for flags and experiments
- **Mutex Groups**: Ensure users are only included in one experiment at a time from a group of experiments
- **Holdout Groups**: Exclude users from experiments to measure long-term product impact
- **Remote and Local Evaluation**: Options for determining which variant a user receives
- **User Targeting**: Target specific users or segments for experiments and flags

## Product Relationships and Architecture

Amplitude Experiment is built around two primary API categories that work together to provide a complete experimentation solution:

1. **Management API**: Used for creating and configuring experiments, flags, and related resources. This API handles all the setup and configuration aspects of the experimentation platform.

2. **Evaluation API**: Responsible for determining which variant a user should receive when they interact with a feature or experiment. This API comes in two forms:
   - Remote evaluation: Server determines variant assignments and tracks events
   - Local evaluation: Client-side determination using downloaded flag configurations

The platform supports both client-side and server-side implementations through different deployment types, allowing for flexibility in how features and experiments are delivered to users.

### Management API Components

The Management API consists of several interconnected components:

- **Flags API**: Manages feature flags, including their variants, deployments, and targeting rules
- **Experiments API**: Configures A/B tests with variants, targeting criteria, and rollout percentages
- **Mutex Groups API**: Creates and manages groups of experiments where users can only participate in one experiment at a time
- **Holdout Groups API**: Configures control groups that are excluded from experiments
- **Deployments API**: Manages deployment environments (client-side or server-side)
- **Versions API**: Tracks change history for flags and experiments

### Evaluation API Components

The Evaluation API provides two primary methods for determining variant assignments:

- **Remote Evaluation API**: The server determines variant assignments and can track exposure events
- **Flags API**: Provides flag configurations for local evaluation on the client side

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Flag**: A feature toggle that can be turned on/off or serve different variants
- **Experiment**: A controlled test comparing different variants against a control
- **Variant**: A specific version or implementation of a feature being tested
- **Deployment**: An environment configuration (client/server) for flags and experiments
- **Deployment Key**: Authentication credential for accessing the Evaluation API
- **Management API Key**: Authentication credential for accessing the Management API
- **Mutex Group**: A group of experiments where a user can only be in one experiment at a time
- **Holdout Group**: A control group excluded from experiments to measure baseline metrics
- **Bucketing**: The process of consistently assigning users to variants
- **Bucketing Key**: The user attribute used to determine variant assignment
- **Evaluation Mode**: How variant assignments are determined (local or remote)
- **User Inclusions**: Explicitly targeting specific users for a variant

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Experiment integrates with the broader Amplitude Analytics platform, creating a closed-loop system for experimentation:

1. **Analytics Integration**: Experiment exposures are tracked as events in Amplitude Analytics
2. **User Properties**: Amplitude user properties can be used for targeting and segmentation
3. **Results Analysis**: Experiment results can be analyzed using Amplitude's reporting tools
4. **Data-Driven Decisions**: The integration allows teams to make decisions based on comprehensive user behavior data

This integration enables product teams to not only run experiments but also to deeply analyze their impact on user behavior and business metrics.

## API Endpoints

### Evaluation API

- **Remote Evaluation**: `GET /vardata`
  - Required: `deployment_key` (auth)
  - Parameters: `user_id`, `device_id`, `flag_keys`, `context`
