## Amplitude Go SDK

The Amplitude Go SDK provides comprehensive analytics tracking capabilities for Go applications through two complementary approaches: a direct SDK implementation and a strongly-typed wrapper called Ampli. The SDK enables developers to track user events, manage user properties, handle revenue analytics, and implement custom data processing through a flexible plugin architecture.

## Product Relationship and Architecture

The Go SDK ecosystem consists of two primary components that work together:

**Core SDK (`analytics-go`)**: The foundational library providing direct API access for event tracking, user management, and analytics operations. This SDK handles the low-level communication with Amplitude's servers and provides flexible configuration options.

**Ampli Wrapper**: A code generation tool that creates strongly-typed tracking libraries from Amplitude Data tracking plans. Ampli wraps the core SDK functionality while providing compile-time type safety and IDE autocomplete support for defined events and properties.

The relationship follows a layered architecture where Ampli generates type-safe interfaces that internally utilize the core `analytics-go` SDK for actual data transmission and processing.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Tracking Plans**: Schema definitions in Amplitude Data that specify event structures, property types, and validation rules. These serve as the source of truth for Ampli code generation.

**Events**: User actions or occurrences tracked in applications, identified by EventType and associated with UserID or DeviceID for attribution.

**User Properties**: Persistent attributes associated with users, managed through Identify operations with methods like Set, SetOnce, Add, Append, and Prepend for different update behaviors.

**Groups**: Organizational entities that users belong to, managed through SetGroup and GroupIdentify operations with groupType and groupName parameters.

**Revenue Tracking**: Specialized event type for monetary transactions using Revenue struct with Price, Quantity, ProductID, and RevenueType fields.

**Plugins**: Extensible components for data processing with two types - PluginTypeEnrichment for data modification and PluginTypeDestination for custom routing, implementing Execute and Setup methods.

**Batching**: Performance optimization technique controlled by FlushQueueSize, FlushInterval, and UseBatch parameters for efficient API communication.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The Go SDK integrates into Amplitude's comprehensive analytics platform ecosystem through several key touchpoints:

**Amplitude Data Integration**: Ampli connects directly to Amplitude Data tracking plans, enabling schema-driven development where backend tracking code stays synchronized with centrally managed event definitions.

**Multi-Platform Consistency**: The SDK follows patterns established across Amplitude's SDK family, ensuring consistent implementation approaches across different programming languages and platforms.

**Server Infrastructure**: Configurable ServerZone (EU/US) and ServerURL options enable compliance with data residency requirements and integration with Amplitude's global infrastructure.

**Storage and Persistence**: Pluggable storage system with InMemoryStorage default and StorageFactory interface allows integration with various persistence mechanisms and MaxStorageCapacity controls.

## API Endpoints and CLI Commands

**Installation Commands**:
- `go get github.com/amplitude/analytics-go` - Core SDK installation
- `npm install -g @amplitude/ampli` - Ampli CLI installation

**Ampli CLI Operations**:
- `ampli pull` - Downloads and generates tracking library from Amplitude Data
- `ampli status` - Verifies tracking plan synchronization

**Core SDK Methods**:
- Client initialization with `Config` struct for configuration
- `Track()` for event recording with EventType, UserID, DeviceID parameters
- `Identify()` for user property management
- `SetGroup()` and `GroupIdentify()` for group analytics
- `Revenue()` tracking with structured revenue data
- `Flush()` for immediate event transmission

**Ampli Generated Methods**:
- `Load()` with LoadOptions for client initialization
- `Identify()` with builder pattern for user properties
- Type-safe `Track()` methods for each defined event (e.g., `SongPlayed()`)
- `Flush()` for queue management

**Configuration Parameters**:
- Retry mechanisms: RetryBaseInterval, RetryThrottledInterval, FlushMaxRetries
- Batch processing: FlushQueueSize, FlushInterval, UseBatch
- Regional compliance: ServerZone, ServerURL
- Storage management: StorageFactory, MaxStorageCapacity

The SDK provides both imperative programming through direct API calls and declarative approaches through Ampli's generated interfaces, accommodating different development preferences while maintaining consistent data collection standards.
