The Amplitude Go SDK is a comprehensive analytics solution for Go applications that enables event tracking and user analytics through Amplitude's platform. The SDK provides both a core analytics library and an enhanced Ampli wrapper that generates strongly-typed tracking code from predefined data schemas.

## Core Components and Features

The primary component is the **analytics-go** package (`github.com/amplitude/analytics-go`), which serves as the foundation for sending events from Go applications to Amplitude's analytics platform. The SDK supports comprehensive event tracking including user events, revenue tracking, user property management, and group analytics.

The **Ampli wrapper** extends the core SDK by generating strongly-typed tracking libraries from Amplitude Data tracking plans. This approach ensures type safety and consistency across tracking implementations by automatically generating Go code that matches predefined event schemas.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The two main products work in a complementary hierarchy:

1. **Core Go SDK (analytics-go)** - Provides the fundamental analytics infrastructure including client initialization, event batching, retry logic, and plugin extensibility
2. **Ampli Wrapper** - Builds on top of the core SDK to provide schema-driven, type-safe event tracking through code generation

The Ampli wrapper internally uses the core SDK's `amplitude.NewClient` and configuration systems while adding its own abstraction layer through methods like `ampli.Instance.Load()`, `ampli.Instance.Track()`, and `ampli.Instance.Identify()`.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core SDK Terminology:**
- `amplitude.Event` - Primary event structure containing UserID, DeviceID, EventType, and event properties
- `amplitude.Identify` - User property management operations for setting, adding, and manipulating user attributes
- `amplitude.Revenue` - Specialized event type for tracking monetary transactions
- `FlushQueueSize`/`FlushInterval` - Batching configuration parameters controlling when events are sent to Amplitude
- `ServerZone` - Geographic routing configuration (EU/US) for data residency compliance
- `Plugin` - Extensibility mechanism with enrichment and destination plugin types

**Ampli-Specific Terminology:**
- `ampli pull` - CLI command to generate tracking code from Amplitude Data tracking plans
- `ampli status` - CLI command to verify tracking plan synchronization
- `LoadOptions` - Configuration object for initializing the Ampli wrapper
- `EventOptions` - Per-event configuration using builder patterns
- Strongly-typed events - Generated event methods that enforce schema compliance at compile time

## Ecosystem Integration

The Go SDK integrates into Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem through several key touchpoints:

- **Amplitude Data** - The Ampli wrapper connects directly to Amplitude's schema management platform to generate type-safe tracking code
- **Batch API** - Events are sent to Amplitude's ingestion endpoints with configurable server zones for data residency
- **Plugin Architecture** - Supports extensibility through enrichment plugins (data transformation) and destination plugins (routing to multiple endpoints)
- **Storage Layer** - Includes `InMemoryStorage` with `MaxStorageCapacity` for local event persistence and retry handling

## API Endpoints and CLI Commands

**CLI Commands:**
- `ampli pull` - Downloads and generates tracking code from Amplitude Data tracking plans
- `ampli status` - Validates current tracking implementation against the tracking plan
- Installation via `npm install -g @amplitude/ampli` or `brew install ampli`

**Core SDK Methods:**
- `amplitude.NewClient()` - Client initialization with API key
- `amplitude.NewConfig()` - Configuration object creation
- `client.Track()` - Event tracking
- `client.Identify()` - User property operations
- `client.SetGroup()` - User group assignment
- `client.GroupIdentify()` - Group property management
- `client.Flush()` - Force event transmission

**Ampli Wrapper Methods:**
- `ampli.Instance.Load()` - Initialize Ampli with configuration
- `ampli.Instance.Track()` - Send strongly-typed events
- `ampli.Instance.Identify()` - User identification with type safety
- `ampli.Instance.Flush()` - Force event transmission through wrapper

The SDK includes sophisticated batching and retry mechanisms controlled by parameters like `RetryBaseInterval`, `FlushMaxRetries`, and supports both synchronous and asynchronous event processing patterns.
