# Amplitude Go SDK Product Overview

The Amplitude Go SDK is a comprehensive analytics tracking solution for Go applications that enables developers to capture and analyze user behavior data. The SDK consists of two main components: the core Go SDK (`analytics-go`) and Ampli for Go, a code-generated tracking library that provides type safety and tracking plan integration.

## Key Features and Concepts

- **Event Tracking**: Capture user interactions and custom events in Go applications
- **User Identity Management**: Identify users and track their properties
- **Revenue Tracking**: Monitor purchase events and revenue metrics
- **Batch Processing**: Efficiently send events in batches to minimize network requests
- **Type Safety**: Generate strongly-typed tracking code based on your tracking plan
- **Plugin System**: Extend SDK functionality through custom plugins
- **Configuration Options**: Customize SDK behavior with various configuration parameters

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Amplitude Go SDK ecosystem consists of two main components that work together:

1. **Core Go SDK (`analytics-go`)**: The foundation library that handles the core functionality of event tracking, batching, and sending data to Amplitude's servers.

2. **Ampli for Go**: A code-generated layer built on top of the core SDK that provides type safety and tracking plan integration. Ampli is generated using the Ampli CLI tool based on your Amplitude Data tracking plan.

The relationship between these components is hierarchical:
- Ampli for Go depends on and uses the core Go SDK
- Ampli provides a strongly-typed interface that enforces your tracking plan
- The core SDK handles the underlying implementation details of event processing and transmission

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: A discrete user action or occurrence that you want to track
- **Identify**: Operations that associate user properties with a user ID
- **User Properties**: Attributes associated with a specific user
- **User Groups**: Collections of users that share common attributes
- **Tracking Plan**: A schema that defines the structure of events and properties
- **Flush**: The process of sending batched events to Amplitude servers
- **Plugin**: A component that can modify or enrich events before they are sent

## Integration with Amplitude Ecosystem

The Go SDK integrates with the broader Amplitude product ecosystem in several ways:

1. **Amplitude Data**: Ampli for Go connects with Amplitude Data tracking plans to generate type-safe tracking code
2. **Amplitude Analytics**: Events tracked through the SDK appear in Amplitude Analytics for analysis
3. **Ampli CLI**: Command-line tool used to generate the Ampli for Go code based on your tracking plan

## API and Usage Examples

### Core Go SDK

```go
// Initialize the SDK
client := amplitude.NewClient(
    amplitude.WithApiKey("YOUR-API-KEY"),
    amplitude.WithFlushQueueSize(200),
    amplitude.WithFlushInterval(10 * time.Second),
)

// Track an event
client.Track(amplitude.Event{
    EventType:   "Button Clicked",
    UserID:      "user-id",
    DeviceID:    "device-id",
    EventProps:  map[string]interface{}{"button_type": "sign-up"},
    UserProps:   map[string]interface{}{"account_type": "premium"},
})

// Identify a user
client.Identify(amplitude.Identify{
    UserID:   "user-id",
    UserProps: map[string]interface{}{
        "$set": map[string]interface{}{
            "name": "John Doe",
            "plan": "enterprise",
        },
    },
})

// Flush events manually
client.Flush()
```

### Ampli for Go

```go
// Initialize Ampli
ampli.Instance.Load(ampli.LoadOptions{
    Client: ampli.AmplitudeClient{
        ApiKey: "YOUR-API-KEY",
    },
})

// Track a strongly-typed event
ampli.Instance.Track(
    "user-id",
    events.SongPlayed{
        SongId: "song-123",
        Title: "Highway to Hell",
        Artist: "AC/DC",
    },
)

// Identify a user with strongly-typed properties
ampli.Instance.Identify(
    "user-id",
    identify.UserProps{
        Plan: "premium",
        Age: 25,
    },
)

// Flush events manually
ampli.Instance.Flush()
```

## Configuration Options

The Go SDK offers several configuration options:

- **ApiKey**: Your Amplitude project API key
- **FlushQueueSize**: Number of events to batch before sending (default: 200)
- **FlushInterval**: Time interval for automatic flushing (default: 10 seconds)
- **ServerUrl**: Custom server endpoint for sending events
- **ServerZone**: Geographic server zone (US or EU)
- **UseBatch**: Whether to use the batch API endpoint
- **OptOut**: Disable event tracking when set to true
