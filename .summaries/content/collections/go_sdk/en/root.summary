# Amplitude Go SDK and Ampli for Go

## Product Overview

Amplitude's Go SDK is a comprehensive analytics solution for tracking user behavior in Go applications. The SDK consists of two main components:

1. **Go SDK (amplitude/analytics-go)**: The core SDK that provides event tracking, user identification, and analytics functionality.
2. **Ampli for Go**: A code-generated tracking library that provides type-safe event tracking based on a predefined tracking plan.

The solution enables developers to implement analytics in Go applications with features for tracking events, managing user properties, tracking revenue, and extending functionality through plugins.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Core Analytics Capabilities
- **Event Tracking**: Track user actions and behaviors
- **User Identification**: Associate events with specific users
- **User Properties Management**: Store and update user attributes
- **User Groups**: Organize users into groups for analysis
- **Revenue Tracking**: Monitor purchase and transaction data
- **Batch Processing**: Efficiently send multiple events
- **Flush Control**: Control when events are sent to Amplitude

### Development Features
- **Type Safety**: Strongly typed methods for tracking events (with Ampli)
- **Tracking Plan Integration**: Implement analytics according to a predefined schema
- **Plugin System**: Extend functionality with custom plugins
- **Implementation Verification**: Verify tracking implementation against the tracking plan

## Relationship Between Products and Features

The Go SDK ecosystem consists of two complementary components:

1. **Go SDK (amplitude/analytics-go)**:
   - Serves as the foundation for all analytics functionality
   - Provides the core event tracking and user identification capabilities
   - Offers configuration options for customizing behavior
   - Includes a plugin system for extending functionality

2. **Ampli for Go**:
   - Built on top of the core Go SDK
   - Generates code based on a tracking plan defined in Amplitude
   - Provides type-safe methods for tracking events
   - Ensures analytics implementation matches the tracking plan
   - Simplifies implementation with strongly typed event builders

Ampli for Go depends on the core Go SDK but provides additional structure and type safety. While the core SDK can be used independently, Ampli provides a more structured approach to analytics implementation.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: A user action or occurrence that is tracked (e.g., page view, button click)
- **Identify**: Operations that associate user properties with a user
- **User Properties**: Attributes associated with a specific user
- **User Groups**: Collections of users that can be analyzed together
- **GroupIdentify**: Operations that associate properties with a group
- **Tracking Plan**: A schema that defines events, properties, and their types
- **Flush**: The process of sending batched events to Amplitude servers
- **FlushQueueSize**: Configuration parameter that determines when events are automatically sent
- **Plugins**: Extensions that can modify events or send them to additional destinations
  - **Enrichment Plugins**: Add or modify data in events
  - **Destination Plugins**: Send events to additional destinations beyond Amplitude

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Go SDK integrates with the broader Amplitude ecosystem in several ways:

1. **Amplitude Analytics Backend**: Events tracked through the SDK are sent to Amplitude's analytics platform for processing and analysis.

2. **Amplitude Data**: The tracking plan used by Ampli for Go is defined in Amplitude Data, ensuring consistency between implementation and analytics expectations.

3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: The Go SDK follows similar patterns to other Amplitude SDKs, allowing for consistent implementation across different platforms.

4. **Plugin System**: The SDK can be extended to integrate with other systems through custom plugins.

## API and Implementation Details

### Go SDK Installation and Initialization

```go
import "github.com/amplitude/analytics-go/amplitude"

client := amplitude.NewClient(amplitude.NewConfig("API_KEY"))
```

### Configuration Options

```go
config := amplitude.NewConfig("API_KEY")
config.FlushQueueSize = 200
config.FlushInterval = 10 * time.Second
client := amplitude.NewClient(config)
```

### Event Tracking

```go
client.Track(amplitude.Event{
    EventType: "Button Clicked",
    EventProperties: map[string]interface{}{
        "buttonColor": "blue",
    },
    UserID: "user-id",
})
```

### User Identification

```go
client.Identify(amplitude.Identify{
    UserID: "user-id",
    UserProperties: map[string]interface{}{
        "$set": map[string]interface{}{
            "email": "user@example.com",
        },
    },
})
```

### Ampli for Go Usage

```go
// Initialize Ampli
ampli.Instance.Load(ampli.LoadOptions{
    Client: amplitude.NewClient(amplitude.NewConfig("API_KEY")),
})

// Identify a user
ampli.Instance.Identify("user-id", ampli.Identify{
    UserProperties: map[string]interface{}{
        "email": "user@example.com",
    },
})

// Track a strongly typed event
ampli.Instance.Track("user-id", ampli.SongPlayed{
    SongId: "song-1",
    Title: "Song Title",
})

// Flush events
ampli.Instance.Flush()
```

### Ampli CLI Commands

```bash
# Pull tracking plan from Amplitude
ampli pull

# Check implementation status
ampli status
```

The Go SDK and Ampli for Go provide a comprehensive solution for implementing analytics in Go applications, with flexibility for custom implementations and structure for maintaining consistency with a defined tracking plan.
