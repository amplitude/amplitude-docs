# Amplitude Go SDK Product Overview

The Amplitude Go SDK is a comprehensive analytics tracking solution for Go applications that enables developers to capture user behavior, track events, manage user properties, and analyze application usage patterns.

## Key Features and Concepts

- **Event Tracking**: Capture user interactions and custom events within Go applications
- **User Identification**: Associate events with specific users and manage user properties
- **Revenue Tracking**: Monitor in-app purchases and revenue-generating activities
- **Batch Processing**: Efficiently send multiple events in batches to optimize network usage
- **Plugin System**: Extend functionality through enrichment and destination plugins
- **Strongly-Typed Analytics**: Generate type-safe tracking code based on a tracking plan (via Ampli)

## Product Components

The Go SDK consists of two main components:

1. **Core Go SDK (`amplitude/analytics-go`)**: The foundation library that provides all core analytics functionality
2. **Ampli for Go**: A code generation tool that creates strongly-typed wrappers around the core SDK based on a tracking plan

### Relationship Between Components

- The **Core Go SDK** provides the fundamental analytics tracking capabilities and can be used independently
- **Ampli for Go** is built on top of the core SDK and generates type-safe code based on a tracking plan defined in Amplitude
- Ampli-generated code calls the underlying core SDK methods but provides compile-time validation of event properties

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: A discrete user action or occurrence that is tracked (e.g., button click, page view)
- **User Properties**: Attributes associated with a user (e.g., name, email, preferences)
- **Identify Operation**: Actions that modify user properties without generating an event
- **User Groups**: Collections of users that can be analyzed together (e.g., organizations, teams)
- **Tracking Plan**: A schema that defines the expected events and their properties
- **Flush**: The process of sending batched events to Amplitude servers
- **Plugin**: An extension that can modify events (enrichment) or send them to additional destinations

## Integration in Product Ecosystem

The Go SDK integrates with the broader Amplitude ecosystem:

- Connects to Amplitude's analytics backend for data processing and visualization
- Works with Amplitude's Data planning features to enforce tracking plan consistency
- Supports the Amplitude Plugin system for extending functionality
- Integrates with the Ampli CLI tool for code generation and tracking plan validation

## API and Usage Examples

### Core SDK Usage

```go
// Initialize the SDK
client := amplitude.NewClient(amplitude.NewConfig("API_KEY"))

// Track an event
client.Track(amplitude.Event{
    EventType: "Button Clicked",
    UserID:    "user-id",
    EventProperties: map[string]interface{}{
        "buttonColor": "blue",
    },
})

// Identify a user
client.Identify(amplitude.Identify{
    UserID: "user-id",
    UserProperties: map[string]interface{}{
        "$set": map[string]interface{}{
            "name": "John Doe",
            "plan": "premium",
        },
    },
})

// Track revenue
client.Revenue(amplitude.Revenue{
    UserID:          "user-id",
    ProductID:       "product-123",
    Price:           9.99,
    Quantity:        1,
    RevenueType:     "purchase",
})

// Flush events manually
client.Flush()
```

### Ampli Usage

```go
// Initialize Ampli
ampli.Instance.Load(ampli.LoadOptions{
    Client: ampli.AmplitudeClient{
        ApiKey: "API_KEY",
    },
})

// Track a strongly-typed event
ampli.Instance.SongPlayed("user-id", &events.SongPlayedEvent{
    SongId: "song-123",
    Title:  "Song Title",
    Artist: "Artist Name",
})

// Identify a user with strongly-typed properties
ampli.Instance.Identify("user-id", &ampli.Identify{
    UserProp: &ampli.UserPropSet{
        Premium: true,
    },
})

// Flush events
ampli.Instance.Flush()
```

### Ampli CLI Commands

```bash
# Pull the latest tracking plan
ampli pull

# Check implementation status
ampli status
```

## Configuration Options

The SDK can be configured with various options:

- `FlushQueueSize`: Controls the number of events to batch before sending
- `FlushInterval`: Sets the time between automatic flushes
- `MinIDLength`: Specifies the minimum length for user IDs
- `ServerZone`: Determines which Amplitude server to send data to (US/EU)
- `ServerURL`: Allows setting a custom server endpoint
- `LogLevel`: Controls the verbosity of SDK logging
