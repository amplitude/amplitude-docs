## Amplitude Go SDK

The Amplitude Go SDK (analytics-go) is a comprehensive analytics solution for Go applications that enables event tracking, user analytics, and behavioral data collection. The SDK provides two primary interfaces: a direct Go SDK for flexible implementation and an Ampli wrapper that generates strongly-typed tracking libraries from Amplitude Data tracking plans.

## Product Relationship and Architecture

The Go SDK ecosystem consists of two complementary components:

**Core Go SDK (analytics-go)**: The foundational package (`github.com/amplitude/analytics-go`) that provides direct event tracking capabilities with full configuration control and plugin extensibility.

**Ampli Wrapper**: A code generation layer that sits on top of the core SDK, creating strongly-typed tracking libraries based on predefined tracking plans from Amplitude Data. This wrapper ensures type safety and consistency across tracking implementations.

The relationship follows a layered architecture where Ampli generates Go code that internally uses the analytics-go SDK, providing both flexibility (direct SDK) and safety (Ampli wrapper) options for different development needs.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Event Concepts:**
- `amplitude.Event`: Primary event structure containing UserID, DeviceID, EventType, and event properties
- `amplitude.Client`: Main SDK client for initialization and event dispatch
- `amplitude.Identify`: User property management operations for setting, adding, and manipulating user attributes
- `amplitude.Revenue`: Specialized event type for tracking monetary transactions

**Configuration Parameters:**
- `FlushQueueSize`/`FlushInterval`: Batching behavior controls for event transmission
- `ServerZone`: Data residency settings (EU/US) for compliance requirements
- `UseBatch`: Toggle for batch API mode versus individual event transmission
- `StorageFactory`/`InMemoryStorage`: Event persistence and caching mechanisms
- `MinIDLength`: User/device identifier validation parameters

**Ampli-Specific Terms:**
- `ampli.Instance`: Generated client instance from tracking plan
- `LoadOptions`: Configuration object for Ampli initialization
- `EventOptions`: Per-event configuration for tracking customization
- Tracking Plan: Schema definition in Amplitude Data that drives code generation

**Plugin Architecture:**
- Enrichment Plugins: Middleware for event data enhancement
- Destination Plugins: Custom event routing and transmission handlers

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The Go SDK integrates into Amplitude's comprehensive analytics platform ecosystem:

**Data Pipeline Integration**: Events flow from the Go SDK through Amplitude's ingestion infrastructure, supporting both US and EU data residency requirements through ServerZone configuration.

**Amplitude Data Integration**: The Ampli wrapper connects directly to Amplitude Data's tracking plan management system, enabling schema-driven development workflows where data teams define tracking specifications that automatically generate type-safe Go code.

**Cross-Platform Consistency**: The SDK follows Amplitude's universal event schema and plugin architecture patterns, ensuring consistency with other platform SDKs (iOS, Android, JavaScript) for unified analytics implementations.

**Enterprise Features**: Support for user groups (`SetGroup`, `GroupIdentify`), revenue tracking, and extensible plugin systems aligns with Amplitude's enterprise analytics capabilities.

## API Endpoints and Command Line Interface

**CLI Commands:**
- `ampli pull`: Downloads and generates Go tracking code from Amplitude Data tracking plans
- `ampli status`: Validates local tracking implementation against remote tracking plan schemas

**Installation Commands:**
```
go get github.com/amplitude/analytics-go
npm install -g @amplitude/ampli
brew install amplitude/ampli/ampli
```

**Core SDK Methods:**
- `amplitude.NewClient()`: Client initialization with API key and configuration
- `client.Track()`: Event tracking with amplitude.Event objects
- `client.Identify()`: User property management with amplitude.Identify operations
- `client.SetGroup()`/`client.GroupIdentify()`: User group management
- `client.Revenue()`: Revenue event tracking
- `client.Flush()`: Manual event transmission trigger

**Ampli Generated Methods:**
- `ampli.Load()`: Initialize Ampli instance with LoadOptions
- `ampli.Identify()`: Type-safe user identification
- `ampli.Track()`: Strongly-typed event tracking with generated event methods
- `ampli.Flush()`: Event queue management

The SDK supports extensive configuration through builder patterns and options objects, enabling fine-tuned control over batching behavior, retry logic, storage mechanisms, and data routing while maintaining simplicity for basic use cases.
