# Amplitude Go SDK Product Overview

The Amplitude Go SDK is a comprehensive analytics tracking solution for Go applications that enables developers to capture user behavior, track events, and manage user properties. The SDK consists of two main components: the core Go SDK (`analytics-go`) and Ampli for Go, a code-generated tracking library that provides type safety based on your tracking plan.

## Key Features and Concepts

- **Event Tracking**: Capture user interactions and custom events with rich metadata
- **User Identification**: Associate events with specific users and their properties
- **Batch Processing**: Efficiently send events in batches to minimize network requests
- **Revenue Tracking**: Track revenue-related events with specialized methods
- **User Groups**: Organize users into groups for segmentation and analysis
- **Plugin System**: Extend SDK functionality through custom plugins
- **Type Safety**: Generate strongly-typed tracking methods from your Amplitude Data tracking plan

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Go SDK ecosystem consists of two main components that work together:

1. **Core Go SDK (`analytics-go`)**: The foundation library that handles the core functionality of event tracking, batching, and communication with Amplitude's servers.

2. **Ampli for Go**: A code-generated layer built on top of the core SDK that provides type safety based on your tracking plan defined in Amplitude Data. It acts as a wrapper around the core SDK, providing strongly-typed methods for tracking events.

The relationship is hierarchical - Ampli for Go depends on and uses the core Go SDK for the actual event transmission, while adding type safety and validation on top.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Tracking Plan**: A schema that defines the structure of events and user properties in your application
- **Event**: A user action or occurrence that you want to track
- **Identify**: Operations that update user properties without sending an event
- **User Properties**: Attributes associated with a user (e.g., name, email, preferences)
- **Event Properties**: Metadata associated with a specific event
- **Group**: A collection of users that can be analyzed together
- **Plugin**: An extension that can modify or enrich events before they're sent
- **Flush**: The process of sending batched events to Amplitude servers

## Integration in the Amplitude Ecosystem

The Go SDK integrates with the broader Amplitude platform by:

1. Sending tracked events to Amplitude's servers for analysis
2. Supporting Amplitude Data tracking plans for consistent event tracking across platforms
3. Enabling data to flow into Amplitude's analytics dashboards and tools
4. Supporting user identity management that aligns with other Amplitude SDKs

## API and Command Line Usage

### Core SDK API Endpoints

```go
// Initialize the SDK
client := amplitude.NewClient(amplitude.NewConfig("API_KEY"))

// Track an event
client.Track(amplitude.Event{
    EventType: "Button Clicked",
    UserID:    "user-id",
    EventProperties: map[string]interface{}{
        "buttonColor": "blue",
    },
})

// Identify a user
client.Identify(amplitude.Identify{
    UserID: "user-id",
    UserProperties: map[string]interface{}{
        "$set": map[string]interface{}{
            "name": "John Doe",
        },
    },
})

// Track revenue
client.Revenue(amplitude.Revenue{
    UserID:        "user-id",
    ProductID:     "product-123",
    Price:         9.99,
    Quantity:      1,
})

// Flush events manually
client.Flush()
```

### Ampli CLI Commands

```bash
# Pull tracking plan and generate code
ampli pull

# Check implementation status
ampli status
```

### Ampli for Go API

```go
// Initialize Ampli
ampli.Instance.Load(ampli.LoadOptions{
    Client: amplitude.NewClient(amplitude.NewConfig("API_KEY")),
})

// Identify a user
ampli.Instance.Identify("user-id", ampli.EventOptions{}, ampli.Identify{
    UserProp: "value",
})

// Track a strongly-typed event
ampli.Instance.Track("user-id", ampli.EventOptions{}, ampli.SongPlayed{
    SongId: "song-123",
})

// Flush events
ampli.Instance.Flush()
```

## Configuration Options

The SDK offers several configuration options:

- **FlushQueueSize**: Maximum number of events to batch before sending (default: 200)
- **FlushInterval**: Time between automatic batch sends (default: 10s)
- **MinIDLength**: Minimum length for user/device IDs (default: 5)
- **ServerURL**: Custom server endpoint for sending events
- **ServerZone**: Geographic server zone (US or EU)
- **LogLevel**: Control logging verbosity
- **Plugins**: Custom plugins for event enrichment or modification
