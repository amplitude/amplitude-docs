# Amplitude Go SDK Product Overview

The Amplitude Go SDK is a comprehensive analytics tracking solution for Go applications that enables developers to capture user behavior, track events, manage user properties, and send analytics data to Amplitude's platform.

## Key Features and Concepts

- **Event Tracking**: Capture user interactions and custom events in Go applications
- **User Identification**: Associate events with specific users through identification methods
- **User Properties Management**: Track and update user attributes over time
- **Revenue Tracking**: Monitor in-app purchases and revenue-generating activities
- **Batch Processing**: Efficiently send events in batches to minimize network requests
- **Plugin System**: Extend SDK functionality through custom plugins
- **Strongly Typed Events**: Generate type-safe event tracking code based on your tracking plan

## Product Relationship and Architecture

The Go SDK consists of two main components:

1. **Core Go SDK (`amplitude/analytics-go`)**: The foundation library that provides all core functionality for tracking events, managing users, and sending data to Amplitude.

2. **Ampli for Go**: A code generation layer that sits on top of the core SDK, providing strongly-typed methods based on your Amplitude Data tracking plan.

The relationship between these components is hierarchical:
- Ampli for Go depends on and utilizes the core Go SDK
- Ampli provides type safety and validation according to your tracking plan
- The core SDK handles the actual event processing, batching, and transmission

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: A discrete user action or occurrence that you want to track
- **Identify**: Operations that associate user properties with a user ID
- **User Properties**: Attributes that describe a user (demographics, preferences, etc.)
- **User Groups**: Collections of users that share common attributes
- **Tracking Plan**: A schema that defines the structure of events and properties
- **Flush**: The process of sending batched events to Amplitude's servers
- **Plugin**: Custom code modules that can modify or process events before sending
- **Event Builders**: Strongly-typed methods generated by Ampli for creating events

## Integration with Amplitude Ecosystem

The Go SDK integrates with the broader Amplitude product ecosystem by:

1. Connecting with Amplitude Data's tracking plans for consistent event schemas
2. Sending data to Amplitude's analytics platform for processing and visualization
3. Supporting the Amplitude plugin architecture for extensibility
4. Enabling cross-platform tracking when used alongside other Amplitude SDKs

## API and Usage

### Core Go SDK

```go
// Installation
go get github.com/amplitude/analytics-go

// Initialization
client := amplitude.NewClient(amplitude.NewConfig("API_KEY"))

// Tracking events
client.Track(amplitude.Event{
    EventType: "Button Clicked",
    UserID:    "user-id",
    EventProperties: map[string]interface{}{
        "buttonColor": "blue",
    },
})

// Identifying users
client.Identify(amplitude.Identify{
    UserID: "user-id",
    UserProperties: map[string]interface{}{
        "$set": map[string]interface{}{
            "email": "user@example.com",
        },
    },
})

// Flushing events
client.Flush()
```

### Ampli for Go

```go
// Installation
go get github.com/amplitude/ampli-go

// Pulling tracking plan
ampli pull

// Initialization
ampli.Instance.Load(ampli.LoadOptions{
    Client: amplitude.NewClient(amplitude.NewConfig("API_KEY")),
})

// Tracking strongly-typed events
ampli.Instance.Track(ampli.SongPlayed{
    SongId: "song-123",
    Title:  "Highway to Hell",
})

// Identifying users
ampli.Instance.Identify("user-id", ampli.Identify{
    Email: "user@example.com",
})

// Flushing events
ampli.Instance.Flush()
```

## Configuration Options

The SDK offers several configuration options:

- **FlushQueueSize**: Maximum number of events to batch before sending
- **FlushInterval**: Time interval for automatically sending batched events
- **MinIDLength**: Minimum length requirement for user IDs
- **ServerZone**: Geographic region for data storage (US or EU)
- **ServerURL**: Custom endpoint URL for sending events
- **LogLevel**: Controls the verbosity of SDK logging

These options can be set during initialization to customize the SDK's behavior according to specific application requirements.
