# Amplitude Go SDK

## Overview

The Amplitude Go SDK is an analytics tracking solution for Go applications that enables developers to capture and analyze user behavior data. The SDK provides comprehensive event tracking capabilities, user identity management, revenue tracking, and batch processing to efficiently monitor application usage and user interactions.

The SDK consists of two primary components:
- **Core Go SDK (`analytics-go`)**: The foundation library handling core event tracking functionality
- **Ampli for Go**: A code-generated tracking library providing type safety and tracking plan integration

## Product Relationships

The Amplitude Go SDK ecosystem has a hierarchical structure:

1. **Core Go SDK (`analytics-go`)**:
   - Provides the fundamental event tracking capabilities
   - Handles event batching, processing, and transmission to Amplitude servers
   - Manages user identity and properties
   - Implements the plugin system for extending functionality

2. **Ampli for Go**:
   - Built on top of the core SDK
   - Generated from your Amplitude Data tracking plan using the Ampli CLI
   - Provides strongly-typed interfaces that enforce your tracking plan
   - Ensures consistency between your tracking implementation and defined schema

The relationship flow is:
- Ampli for Go depends on the core SDK for underlying implementation
- Ampli provides type safety and tracking plan validation
- The core SDK handles the technical details of event processing and transmission

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: A discrete user action or occurrence tracked in your application
- **Identify**: Operations that associate specific properties with a user ID
- **User Properties**: Attributes and characteristics associated with a specific user
- **User Groups**: Collections of users sharing common attributes for group-level analysis
- **Tracking Plan**: A schema defining the structure of events and properties for consistency
- **Flush**: The process of sending batched events to Amplitude servers
- **Plugin**: A component that can modify or enrich events in the processing pipeline
- **Batch Processing**: Grouping multiple events together to minimize network requests
- **DeviceID**: A unique identifier for the device sending events
- **UserID**: A unique identifier for the user performing actions

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Go SDK integrates with the broader Amplitude ecosystem:

1. **Amplitude Data**:
   - Ampli for Go connects with Amplitude Data tracking plans
   - Enables generation of type-safe tracking code based on your defined schema
   - Ensures implementation matches your tracking plan specifications

2. **Amplitude Analytics**:
   - Events tracked through the SDK appear in Amplitude Analytics dashboards
   - Enables analysis of user behavior and application performance
   - Supports cohort analysis and user segmentation

3. **Ampli CLI**:
   - Command-line tool used to generate the Ampli for Go code
   - Converts your tracking plan into strongly-typed Go code
   - Facilitates updates when your tracking plan changes

## API and Implementation

### Core Go SDK

```go
// Initialize the SDK
client := amplitude.NewClient(
    amplitude.WithApiKey("YOUR-API-KEY"),
    amplitude.WithFlushQueueSize(200),
    amplitude.WithFlushInterval(10 * time.Second),
)

// Track an event
client.Track(amplitude.Event{
    EventType:   "Button Clicked",
    UserID:      "user-id",
    DeviceID:    "device-id",
    EventProps:  map[string]interface{}{"button_type": "sign-up"},
    UserProps:   map[string]interface{}{"account_type": "premium"},
})

// Identify a user
client.Identify(amplitude.Identify{
    UserID:   "user-id",
    UserProps: map[string]interface{}{
        "$set": map[string]interface{}{
            "name": "John Doe",
            "plan": "enterprise",
        },
    },
})

// Flush events manually
client.Flush()
```

### Ampli for Go

```go
// Initialize Ampli
ampli.Instance.Load(ampli.LoadOptions{
    Client: ampli.AmplitudeClient{
        ApiKey: "YOUR-API-KEY",
    },
})

// Track a strongly-typed event
ampli.Instance.Track(
    "user-id",
    events.SongPlayed{
        SongId: "song-123",
        Title: "Highway to Hell",
        Artist: "AC/DC",
    },
)

// Identify a user with strongly-typed properties
ampli.Instance.Identify(
    "user-id",
    identify.UserProps{
        Plan: "premium",
        Age: 25,
    },
)

// Flush events manually
ampli.Instance.Flush()
```

The SDK offers extensive configuration options including:
- **ApiKey**: Your Amplitude project API key
- **FlushQueueSize**: Number of events to batch before sending (default: 200)
- **FlushInterval**: Time interval for automatic flushing (default: 10 seconds)
- **ServerUrl**: Custom server endpoint for sending events
- **ServerZone**: Geographic server zone (US or EU)
- **UseBatch**: Whether to use the batch API endpoint
- **OptOut**: Disable event tracking when set to true
