# Amplitude Go SDK

The Amplitude Go SDK is a comprehensive analytics solution for tracking user behavior and events in Go applications. It provides developers with tools to capture, analyze, and understand how users interact with their applications.

## Key Features and Concepts

- **Event Tracking**: Capture user interactions and custom events with detailed properties
- **User Identification**: Associate events with specific users and maintain user profiles
- **Batch Processing**: Efficiently send events in batches to optimize network usage
- **Revenue Tracking**: Specialized methods for tracking revenue-related events
- **User Groups**: Organize and analyze users in logical groupings
- **Plugin System**: Extend functionality through custom plugins
- **Type Safety**: Generate strongly-typed tracking methods from your tracking plan

## Product Architecture and Relationships

The Amplitude Go SDK consists of two main components:

1. **Core Go SDK (`analytics-go`)**: The foundation library that handles event tracking, batching, and server communication. It provides the core functionality for sending analytics data to Amplitude.

2. **Ampli for Go**: A code-generated wrapper built on top of the core SDK that provides type safety based on your tracking plan defined in Amplitude Data. It ensures that events conform to your predefined schema.

The relationship between these components is hierarchical - Ampli for Go depends on the core SDK for event transmission while adding type safety and validation capabilities.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: A discrete user action or occurrence you want to track (e.g., "Button Clicked", "Purchase Completed")
- **Event Properties**: Metadata associated with a specific event occurrence
- **User ID**: A unique identifier for each user of your application
- **Device ID**: A unique identifier for each device using your application
- **User Properties**: Attributes associated with a user that persist across sessions
- **Identify**: Operations that update user properties without sending an event
- **Group**: A collection of users that can be analyzed together (e.g., organizations, teams)
- **Tracking Plan**: A schema that defines the structure of events and properties in your application
- **Flush**: The process of sending batched events to Amplitude servers
- **Plugin**: An extension that can modify or process events before they're sent

## Integration in the Amplitude Ecosystem

The Go SDK integrates with the broader Amplitude platform by:

1. Sending tracked events to Amplitude's analytics servers for processing and analysis
2. Supporting Amplitude Data tracking plans for consistent event tracking across platforms
3. Enabling data to flow into Amplitude's analytics dashboards, charts, and reporting tools
4. Supporting user identity management that aligns with other Amplitude SDKs
5. Providing revenue tracking that integrates with Amplitude's revenue analysis features

## API Usage Examples

### Core SDK API

```go
// Initialize the SDK
client := amplitude.NewClient(amplitude.NewConfig("API_KEY"))

// Track an event
client.Track(amplitude.Event{
    EventType: "Button Clicked",
    UserID:    "user-123",
    EventProperties: map[string]interface{}{
        "buttonColor": "blue",
        "buttonText": "Submit",
    },
})

// Identify a user
client.Identify(amplitude.Identify{
    UserID: "user-123",
    UserProperties: map[string]interface{}{
        "$set": map[string]interface{}{
            "name": "John Doe",
            "email": "john@example.com",
        },
    },
})

// Track revenue
client.Revenue(amplitude.Revenue{
    UserID:        "user-123",
    ProductID:     "product-456",
    Price:         9.99,
    Quantity:      1,
    RevenueType:   "purchase",
})

// Group users
client.GroupIdentify(amplitude.GroupIdentify{
    UserID: "user-123",
    Groups: map[string]interface{}{
        "orgId": "org-789",
    },
    GroupProperties: map[string]interface{}{
        "orgId": map[string]interface{}{
            "$set": map[string]interface{}{
                "name": "Acme Inc",
                "plan": "enterprise",
            },
        },
    },
})

// Flush events manually
client.Flush()
```

### Ampli for Go API

```go
// Initialize Ampli
ampli.Instance.Load(ampli.LoadOptions{
    Client: amplitude.NewClient(amplitude.NewConfig("API_KEY")),
})

// Identify a user with strongly-typed properties
ampli.Instance.Identify("user-123", ampli.EventOptions{}, ampli.Identify{
    Name: "John Doe",
    Email: "john@example.com",
})

// Track a strongly-typed event
ampli.Instance.Track("user-123", ampli.EventOptions{}, ampli.SongPlayed{
    SongId: "song-456",
    Title: "Bohemian Rhapsody",
    Artist: "Queen",
})

// Flush events
ampli.Instance.Flush()
```

### Ampli CLI Commands

```bash
# Pull tracking plan and generate code
ampli pull

# Check implementation status
ampli status
```

## Configuration Options

The SDK offers several configuration options:

- **FlushQueueSize**: Maximum number of events to batch before sending (default: 200)
- **FlushInterval**: Time between automatic batch sends (default: 10s)
- **MinIDLength**: Minimum length for user/device IDs (default: 5)
- **ServerURL**: Custom server endpoint for sending events
- **ServerZone**: Geographic server zone (US or EU)
- **LogLevel**: Control logging verbosity
- **Plugins**: Custom plugins for event enrichment or modification
- **OptOut**: Disable event tracking when set to true
