# Amplitude Go SDK

The Amplitude Go SDK is a robust analytics tracking solution designed for Go applications that enables developers to capture and analyze user behavior, track events, and manage user properties.

## Product Overview

The Amplitude Go SDK provides a comprehensive set of tools for tracking user interactions within Go applications. It allows developers to capture events, identify users, track revenue, and analyze application usage patterns. The SDK supports batch processing for efficient network usage and includes a plugin system for extending functionality.

## Product Components and Relationships

The Go SDK ecosystem consists of two primary components:

1. **Core Go SDK (`amplitude/analytics-go`)**: The foundation library that provides all essential analytics functionality including event tracking, user identification, and revenue monitoring.

2. **Ampli for Go**: A code generation tool that creates strongly-typed wrappers around the core SDK based on a tracking plan defined in Amplitude. This provides compile-time validation of event properties and ensures consistency with the tracking plan.

The relationship between these components is hierarchical - Ampli for Go is built on top of the core SDK, generating type-safe code that ultimately calls the underlying core SDK methods. While the core SDK can be used independently, Ampli provides additional type safety and validation.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: A discrete user action or occurrence tracked within the application (e.g., button clicks, page views)
- **User Properties**: Attributes associated with a specific user (e.g., name, email, preferences)
- **Identify Operation**: Actions that modify user properties without generating an event
- **User Groups**: Collections of users that can be analyzed together (e.g., organizations, teams)
- **Tracking Plan**: A schema defining the expected events and their properties
- **Flush**: The process of sending batched events to Amplitude servers
- **Plugin**: An extension that can modify events (enrichment) or send them to additional destinations

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Go SDK integrates with the broader Amplitude ecosystem in several ways:

- Connects directly to Amplitude's analytics backend for data processing and visualization
- Works with Amplitude's Data planning features to enforce tracking plan consistency
- Supports the Amplitude Plugin system for extending functionality
- Integrates with the Ampli CLI tool for code generation and tracking plan validation

The SDK serves as the data collection component in the Amplitude analytics pipeline, capturing user behavior data that can then be analyzed through Amplitude's visualization and analysis tools.

## API and Usage

### Core SDK API

```go
// Initialize the SDK
client := amplitude.NewClient(amplitude.NewConfig("API_KEY"))

// Track an event
client.Track(amplitude.Event{
    EventType: "Button Clicked",
    UserID:    "user-id",
    EventProperties: map[string]interface{}{
        "buttonColor": "blue",
    },
})

// Identify a user
client.Identify(amplitude.Identify{
    UserID: "user-id",
    UserProperties: map[string]interface{}{
        "$set": map[string]interface{}{
            "name": "John Doe",
            "plan": "premium",
        },
    },
})

// Track revenue
client.Revenue(amplitude.Revenue{
    UserID:          "user-id",
    ProductID:       "product-123",
    Price:           9.99,
    Quantity:        1,
    RevenueType:     "purchase",
})

// Flush events manually
client.Flush()
```

### Ampli Usage

```go
// Initialize Ampli
ampli.Instance.Load(ampli.LoadOptions{
    Client: ampli.AmplitudeClient{
        ApiKey: "API_KEY",
    },
})

// Track a strongly-typed event
ampli.Instance.SongPlayed("user-id", &events.SongPlayedEvent{
    SongId: "song-123",
    Title:  "Song Title",
    Artist: "Artist Name",
})

// Identify a user with strongly-typed properties
ampli.Instance.Identify("user-id", &ampli.Identify{
    UserProp: &ampli.UserPropSet{
        Premium: true,
    },
})

// Flush events
ampli.Instance.Flush()
```

### Ampli CLI Commands

```bash
# Pull the latest tracking plan
ampli pull

# Check implementation status
ampli status
```

The SDK offers extensive configuration options including flush queue size, flush intervals, minimum ID length requirements, server zone selection (US/EU), custom server endpoints, and logging verbosity controls.
