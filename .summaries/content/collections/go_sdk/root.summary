## Amplitude Go SDK

The Amplitude Go SDK (analytics-go) is a comprehensive analytics solution for Go applications that enables event tracking, user analytics, and behavioral data collection. The SDK provides two primary implementation approaches: a direct SDK integration and an Ampli wrapper that generates strongly-typed tracking libraries from Amplitude Data tracking plans.

## Product Relationship and Architecture

The Go SDK ecosystem consists of two complementary components:

**Core Go SDK (analytics-go)**: The foundational package (`github.com/amplitude/analytics-go`) that provides direct event tracking capabilities with flexible configuration options for batching, retry behavior, and plugin extensibility.

**Ampli Wrapper**: A code generation layer that sits on top of the core SDK, creating strongly-typed tracking libraries from Amplitude Data tracking plans. This wrapper enforces schema validation and provides compile-time safety for event tracking.

The relationship follows a layered architecture where Ampli generates type-safe wrappers around the underlying analytics-go SDK functionality, ensuring consistency with predefined tracking plans while maintaining the full power of the core SDK.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core SDK Concepts:**
- `amplitude.Client`: Primary interface for sending events and managing analytics operations
- `amplitude.Event`: Core event structure containing UserID, DeviceID, EventType, and event properties
- `amplitude.Config`: Configuration object controlling batching, retry behavior, and server endpoints
- `amplitude.Identify`: User property management operations for setting, adding, and removing user attributes
- `amplitude.Revenue`: Specialized event type for tracking monetary transactions
- `FlushQueueSize`/`FlushInterval`: Batching parameters controlling when events are sent to Amplitude servers
- `ServerZone`: Geographic routing configuration (US/EU) for data residency compliance

**Ampli-Specific Concepts:**
- `ampli.Instance`: Singleton wrapper providing strongly-typed tracking methods
- `LoadOptions`: Configuration object for initializing the Ampli wrapper with API keys and settings
- Builder Pattern: Fluent interface for constructing events with `.Builder().Build()` syntax
- `EventOptions`: Amplitude-specific fields for customizing event metadata
- Tracking Plan: Schema definition that drives code generation for type-safe event tracking

**Plugin System:**
- Enrichment Plugins: Middleware for modifying events before transmission
- Destination Plugins: Custom endpoints for routing analytics data
- Plugin extensibility for custom analytics workflows

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The Go SDK integrates into Amplitude's comprehensive analytics platform ecosystem:

**Data Pipeline Integration**: Events flow from Go applications through Amplitude's ingestion infrastructure, supporting both US and EU data centers via ServerZone configuration for compliance with regional data residency requirements.

**Amplitude Data Integration**: The Ampli wrapper connects directly to Amplitude Data's tracking plan management system, enabling schema-driven development workflows where data teams define event structures that automatically generate type-safe Go code.

**Cross-Platform Consistency**: The SDK follows Amplitude's unified client architecture patterns, providing consistent APIs and behaviors across mobile, web, and server-side implementations.

**Enterprise Features**: Support for user groups, revenue tracking, and custom storage implementations enables integration with enterprise analytics workflows and data warehousing systems.

## API Endpoints and Command Line Interface

**CLI Commands:**
- `ampli pull`: Downloads and generates strongly-typed tracking code from Amplitude Data tracking plans
- `ampli status`: Verifies implementation status and validates tracking plan compliance

**Core SDK Methods:**
- `amplitude.NewClient()`: Client initialization with API key configuration
- `amplitude.NewConfig()`: Configuration object creation for customizing SDK behavior
- `client.Track()`: Primary event tracking method
- `client.Identify()`: User property management
- `client.GroupIdentify()`: Group-level property management
- `client.Flush()`: Manual event transmission trigger

**Ampli Wrapper Methods:**
- `ampli.Instance.Load()`: Initialize wrapper with configuration
- `ampli.Instance.Track()`: Type-safe event tracking with generated event types
- `ampli.Instance.Identify()`: User identification with builder pattern
- `ampli.Instance.Flush()`: Event transmission control

**Installation:**
- Core SDK: `go get github.com/amplitude/analytics-go`
- Ampli CLI: Separate installation for code generation capabilities

The SDK supports extensive configuration options including retry intervals (`RetryBaseInterval`, `FlushMaxRetries`), storage backends (`StorageFactory`, `InMemoryStorage`), and batching behavior, making it suitable for high-throughput production environments with custom infrastructure requirements.
