# Amplitude Single Sign-On (SSO) Integration

## Overview

Amplitude Single Sign-On (SSO) Integration enables organizations to authenticate users through their existing identity providers using the SAML 2.0 protocol. Available for Growth and Enterprise plan customers, this feature centralizes user authentication, enhances security, and streamlines user management through just-in-time provisioning.

## Key Features

- **SAML 2.0 Compliance**: Supports industry-standard authentication protocol
- **Multiple Identity Provider Support**: Pre-configured integrations with Auth0, G Suite, Azure Active Directory, Okta, and OneLogin
- **Custom Provider Support**: Integration with any SAML 2.0 compliant identity provider
- **Just-in-Time Provisioning**: Automatic user creation upon first successful authentication
- **Configurable SSO Enforcement**: Options for making SSO optional, required for all, or required for specific domains
- **Email-Based User Identification**: Uses email addresses from SAML assertions for user identification

## Product Architecture and Workflow

Amplitude's SSO integration follows a standard SAML 2.0 workflow:

1. User attempts to access Amplitude
2. Authentication request redirects to the configured identity provider (IdP)
3. After successful IdP authentication, a SAML assertion is sent to Amplitude
4. Amplitude verifies the assertion and grants access
5. New users are automatically provisioned through just-in-time provisioning

The SSO configuration is managed at the organization level, ensuring consistent authentication policies across all users.

## Key Terminology

- **SAML 2.0**: Security Assertion Markup Language, the protocol standard for SSO
- **Identity Provider (IdP)**: External system authenticating users (Auth0, G Suite, etc.)
- **Service Provider (SP)**: Amplitude, which relies on the IdP for authentication
- **Metadata File**: XML file containing IdP configuration details
- **Entity ID**: Unique identifier for Amplitude in the SAML configuration
- **Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL**: Amplitude endpoint receiving SAML assertions
- **Just-in-Time (JIT) Provisioning**: Automatic user creation upon first authentication
- **SSO Enforcement**: Policy determining whether SSO is required, optional, or domain-specific

## Integration with Amplitude Ecosystem

Amplitude's SSO functions as the authentication layer for the broader Amplitude Analytics platform. The integration works as follows:

1. SSO authenticates users based on their email address
2. New users created through JIT provisioning receive default project permissions
3. Organization administrators can modify user permissions after provisioning
4. Once authenticated, users access Amplitude's analytics capabilities based on their permissions

This integration ensures secure access to analytics data while leveraging existing enterprise identity systems.

## Configuration Process

SSO is configured through the Amplitude web interface under **Organization Settings > Access & SSO Settings**. Key configuration parameters include:

- Identity provider selection
- Metadata file upload
- Entity ID (typically `amplitude.com/[ORG_ID]`)
- Assertion Consumer Service URL (typically `https://analytics.amplitude.com/saml/[ORG_ID]`)
- SSO enforcement options

Provider-specific configuration processes exist for:
- **Auth0**: Create Auth0 client, configure SAML2 settings, upload IdP certificate
- **Azure AD**: Set up Enterprise application, configure user.mail identifier
- **G Suite**: Download IdP metadata, enable SAML app
- **Okta**: Configure SAML 2.0 application, obtain IdP metadata
- **OneLogin**: Set up SAML2.0 app with Amplitude's org ID

Each integration requires configuration in both the identity provider's interface and Amplitude's SSO settings.
