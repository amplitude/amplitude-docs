# Amplitude Single Sign-On (SSO) Integration

## Overview

Amplitude Single Sign-On (SSO) Integration enables organizations to authenticate users through their existing identity providers using the SAML 2.0 protocol. Available for Growth and Enterprise plan customers, this feature provides centralized authentication, enhanced security, and streamlined user management through just-in-time provisioning.

## Key Features

- **SAML 2.0 Compliance**: Supports industry-standard authentication protocol
- **Multiple Identity Provider Support**: Pre-configured integrations with Auth0, G Suite, Azure Active Directory, Okta, and OneLogin
- **Custom Provider Support**: Integration with any SAML 2.0 compliant identity provider
- **Just-in-Time Provisioning**: Automatic user creation in Amplitude upon first successful authentication
- **Configurable SSO Enforcement**: Options to require SSO authentication
- **Email-Based User Identification**: Uses email addresses from SAML assertions for user identification

## Product Relationships

Amplitude's SSO functionality is a core component of the platform's security and user management framework. It serves as the authentication gateway to the entire Amplitude Analytics platform, controlling access to all analytics data and tools. The SSO configuration is managed centrally at the organization level, ensuring consistent authentication policies across all projects within an organization.

The SSO integration connects directly to:
- **User Management System**: Controls access permissions and project visibility
- **Organization Settings**: Central configuration hub for SSO and access policies
- **Project Access Controls**: Determines default project access for new users created through JIT provisioning

## Key Nomenclature

- **SAML 2.0**: Security Assertion Markup Language, the protocol standard for SSO authentication
- **Identity Provider (IdP)**: External system that authenticates users (e.g., Auth0, G Suite)
- **Service Provider (SP)**: Amplitude platform, which relies on the IdP for authentication
- **Metadata File**: XML file containing configuration details from the IdP
- **Entity ID**: Unique identifier for Amplitude in the SAML configuration (`https://analytics.amplitude.com/saml/metadata/{organizationId}`)
- **Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL**: Endpoint where Amplitude receives SAML assertions (`https://analytics.amplitude.com/saml/sso/{organizationId}`)
- **Just-in-Time (JIT) Provisioning**: Automatic user creation upon first successful authentication
- **SAML Assertion**: Data package containing user authentication information
- **SSO Enforcement**: Policy requiring users to authenticate via SSO

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's SSO functionality integrates with the broader Amplitude Analytics platform as the primary authentication mechanism for enterprise customers. It ensures that only authenticated users from the organization's identity system can access analytics data and tools.

The authentication flow follows standard SAML 2.0 protocol:
1. User attempts to access Amplitude
2. User is redirected to the organization's Identity Provider
3. User authenticates with the IdP
4. IdP sends SAML assertion to Amplitude
5. Amplitude verifies the assertion and grants access
6. If the user doesn't exist in Amplitude, they are automatically provisioned (JIT provisioning)

## Implementation Endpoints and Configuration

### Required Endpoints for All Providers
- **Entity ID**: `https://analytics.amplitude.com/saml/metadata/{organizationId}`
- **ACS URL**: `https://analytics.amplitude.com/saml/sso/{organizationId}`

### Provider-Specific Setup
The documentation includes detailed setup instructions for:
- Auth0
- Azure Active Directory
- G Suite
- Okta
- OneLogin
- Custom/Unlisted Providers

All SSO configurations are managed through the Organization Settings > Access & SSO Settings interface in Amplitude, where administrators can upload IdP metadata files, configure SSO enforcement policies, and manage user provisioning settings.
