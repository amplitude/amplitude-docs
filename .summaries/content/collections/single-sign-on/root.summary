# Amplitude Single Sign-On (SSO) Integration

## Overview

Amplitude's Single Sign-On (SSO) integration enables organizations to authenticate users through their existing identity providers using the SAML 2.0 protocol. Available for Growth and Enterprise plan customers, this feature streamlines user access management while maintaining enterprise-grade security standards. The SSO functionality allows users to access Amplitude using their existing corporate credentials, eliminating the need for separate Amplitude-specific passwords.

## Key Features

- **SAML 2.0 Compliance**: Supports the industry-standard SAML 2.0 protocol for secure authentication
- **Multiple Identity Provider Support**: Pre-configured integrations with popular providers including Auth0, G Suite, Azure Active Directory, Okta, and OneLogin
- **Custom Provider Integration**: Compatibility with any SAML 2.0 compliant identity provider
- **Just-in-Time Provisioning**: Automatic user account creation upon first successful authentication
- **Required SSO Enforcement**: Option to make SSO the exclusive authentication method
- **Email-Based User Matching**: Uses email addresses to link identity provider accounts with Amplitude accounts

## Product Architecture and Relationships

Amplitude's SSO functionality is integrated at the organization level within the platform's security framework. It's accessible through the Organization Settings > Access & SSO Settings interface and serves as a critical component in the authentication workflow:

1. **Authentication Layer**: Acts as the intermediary between the organization's identity provider and Amplitude's user management system
2. **User Management Integration**: Works with Amplitude's user provisioning system to create and manage user accounts
3. **Permission System Interaction**: Interfaces with Amplitude's permission framework to ensure authenticated users have appropriate access levels

In the SAML architecture, Amplitude functions as the Service Provider (SP) while the organization's identity system serves as the Identity Provider (IdP).

## Key Terminology

- **SAML 2.0**: The Security Assertion Markup Language protocol that enables secure exchange of authentication data
- **Identity Provider (IdP)**: External system that authenticates users (e.g., Auth0, Okta)
- **Service Provider (SP)**: Amplitude's role in the SAML relationship, consuming authentication assertions
- **Metadata File**: XML configuration file containing essential IdP connection parameters
- **Entity ID**: Unique identifier for Amplitude in the SAML configuration
- **Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL**: Endpoint where Amplitude receives authentication assertions
- **Just-in-Time Provisioning**: Automatic account creation mechanism for new users
- **Required SSO**: Configuration option that mandates SSO as the only login method
- **SAML Assertion**: Authentication data package transmitted from IdP to Amplitude

## Identity Provider Integrations

Amplitude provides detailed integration guides for popular identity providers:

1. **Auth0**: Requires creating an Auth0 client and configuring SAML2 settings
2. **Azure Active Directory**: Involves setting up an Enterprise application in Azure portal
3. **G Suite**: Requires downloading IdP metadata from G Suite admin console
4. **Okta**: Involves configuring SAML 2.0 application settings in Okta
5. **OneLogin**: Requires configuring the SAML2.0 app in OneLogin

For other SAML 2.0 compliant providers, Amplitude supports custom integration through the "Other" provider option.

## Implementation Process

The SSO implementation follows this general workflow:

1. Configure a SAML application in your identity provider
2. Set the Entity ID and ACS URL in your identity provider configuration
3. Download the metadata XML file from your identity provider
4. In Amplitude, navigate to Organization Settings > Access & SSO Settings
5. Select your identity provider from the dropdown menu
6. Upload the metadata file
7. Configure additional settings (Required SSO, Just-in-Time Provisioning)
8. Test the integration

## Authentication Flow

The SSO authentication process follows these steps:

1. User attempts to access Amplitude
2. User is redirected to the organization's identity provider
3. User authenticates with corporate credentials
4. Identity provider sends a SAML assertion to Amplitude
5. Amplitude verifies the assertion and matches the user by email address
6. If the user exists, they are logged in; if not and Just-in-Time Provisioning is enabled, a new account is created
7. User is granted access to Amplitude based on their permissions

This integration enables secure, streamlined access to Amplitude analytics while leveraging existing enterprise authentication infrastructure.
