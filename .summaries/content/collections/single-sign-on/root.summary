## Amplitude Single Sign-On (SSO) Product Overview

Amplitude's Single Sign-On solution is a SAML 2.0-based authentication system that enables organizations to integrate their existing identity providers with Amplitude's analytics platform. The SSO implementation supports major enterprise identity providers and includes just-in-time user provisioning capabilities, available for Growth and Enterprise plan customers.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The SSO system operates through a standardized SAML 2.0 integration pattern across all supported identity providers. Each integration follows a consistent configuration workflow:

1. **Identity Provider Configuration**: Setting up the Amplitude application within the IdP's management console
2. **SAML Parameter Exchange**: Configuring Entity ID and Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL
3. **Metadata Integration**: Downloading IdP metadata and uploading to Amplitude's organizational settings
4. **Authentication Flow**: SAML assertion processing with email resolution for user identification

The system supports both pre-configured integrations for major providers and a flexible "Other" option for custom SAML 2.0 compliant identity providers.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**SAML 2.0**: Security Assertion Markup Language standard used for authentication and authorization
**Entity ID**: Unique identifier for the service provider (Amplitude) in SAML transactions
**Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL**: Endpoint where SAML assertions are posted after authentication
**Identity Provider (IdP)**: External authentication service (Auth0, Azure AD, G Suite, Okta, OneLogin)
**Service Provider (SP)**: Amplitude acting as the service receiving authentication assertions
**IdP Metadata**: XML configuration file containing identity provider settings and certificates
**Just-in-Time (JIT) Provisioning**: Automatic user account creation upon first successful SSO authentication
**SAML Assertion**: Authentication response containing user identity and attribute information

## Supported Identity Providers and Integrations

**Auth0**: Requires SAML2 addon configuration within Auth0 clients, with certificate metadata exchange through Auth0's Usage tab

**Microsoft Azure Active Directory**: Integration through Azure Enterprise applications with user.mail identifier mapping

**G Suite**: Configuration via Google Admin console SAML apps with IDP metadata download capabilities

**Okta**: SAML 2.0 app integration through Okta admin dashboard with IdP metadata XML generation

**OneLogin**: App setup through OneLogin's application catalog with SAML metadata file export

**Custom Providers**: "Other" option supporting any SAML 2.0 compliant identity provider through manual metadata file upload

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The SSO system integrates with Amplitude's broader organizational management framework through:

- **Organization Settings**: Central configuration hub accessed via Access & SSO Settings
- **Project Permissions**: SSO authentication inherits existing project-level access controls
- **User Management**: Email-based user resolution using SAML assertion attributes (xmlsoap.org identity claims)
- **Plan Restrictions**: Feature availability tied to Growth and Enterprise subscription tiers

## Configuration Endpoints and Management

All SSO configurations are managed through Amplitude's web interface at:
- **Primary Configuration Path**: Organization Settings > Access & SSO Settings > Single Sign-On
- **Identity Provider Selection**: Dropdown menu with pre-configured options plus "Other" for custom providers
- **Metadata Upload Interface**: File upload system for IdP metadata XML/certificate files

The system does not expose direct API endpoints for SSO configuration, relying instead on web-based administrative interfaces for security and compliance purposes.
