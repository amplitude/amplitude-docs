# Amplitude Single Sign-On (SSO) Integration

## Overview

Amplitude Single Sign-On (SSO) is an enterprise security feature that enables organizations to authenticate users through their existing identity providers using the SAML 2.0 protocol. Available exclusively for Growth and Enterprise plan customers, this integration streamlines user access management while enhancing security controls for the Amplitude Analytics platform.

## Key Features

- **SAML 2.0 Compliance**: Implements industry-standard authentication protocol
- **Multiple Identity Provider Support**: Pre-configured integrations with Auth0, G Suite, Azure AD, Okta, and OneLogin
- **Custom Provider Integration**: Compatible with any SAML 2.0 compliant identity provider
- **Just-in-Time (JIT) Provisioning**: Automatically creates user accounts upon first successful authentication
- **Required SSO Enforcement**: Option to restrict access exclusively through SSO
- **Email-Based User Identification**: Uses email addresses to match users between systems

## Product Relationships

Amplitude SSO functions as a Service Provider (SP) within the SAML architecture, interacting with external Identity Providers (IdP) to authenticate users. The integration follows a standard SAML workflow where users are redirected to their organization's identity provider for authentication before being granted access to Amplitude.

The SSO functionality is managed at the organization level through Organization Settings, affecting all users within that organization. It integrates directly with Amplitude's user management system, with email addresses serving as the primary identifier for matching users between systems.

## Key Nomenclature

- **SAML 2.0**: Security Assertion Markup Language, the protocol standard for SSO authentication
- **Identity Provider (IdP)**: External system that authenticates users (Auth0, G Suite, etc.)
- **Service Provider (SP)**: Amplitude's role in the SAML relationship
- **Entity ID**: Unique identifier for Amplitude in the SAML context (`https://analytics.amplitude.com/saml/metadata/{org_id}`)
- **Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL**: Endpoint where authentication responses are sent (`https://analytics.amplitude.com/saml/sso/{org_id}`)
- **Metadata File**: XML document containing configuration details for the identity provider
- **Just-in-Time (JIT) Provisioning**: Automatic user creation upon first successful authentication
- **Required SSO**: Setting that forces all users to authenticate via SSO only

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude SSO is positioned as an enterprise-grade security feature within Amplitude's product tiers. It integrates with:

- **User Management System**: Uses email addresses as the primary identifier for matching users
- **Permission System**: New users created through JIT provisioning receive default project permissions
- **Organization Settings**: Configured through the "Access & SSO Settings" section

The SSO feature is only available for Growth and Enterprise plan customers, indicating its positioning as an advanced security capability within Amplitude's product hierarchy.

## Configuration Endpoints

The primary configuration interface is accessed through:
- **Organization Settings > Access & SSO Settings**

Key configuration parameters in Amplitude:
- Identity Provider selection
- Upload of IdP metadata XML file

Key configuration parameters for the identity provider:
- **Entity ID**: `https://analytics.amplitude.com/saml/metadata/{org_id}`
- **ACS URL**: `https://analytics.amplitude.com/saml/sso/{org_id}`

Where `{org_id}` is the unique identifier for the Amplitude organization.

Provider-specific configurations may require setting user identifier attributes (typically `user.email` or `user.mail`).
