## Amplitude Single Sign-On (SSO)

Amplitude's Single Sign-On solution is a SAML 2.0-based authentication system that enables organizations to centrally manage user access through existing identity providers. Available on Growth and Enterprise plans, the SSO implementation supports just-in-time (JIT) provisioning for automatic user onboarding and integrates with Amplitude's organizational access control framework.

## Supported Identity Providers and Integration Architecture

The SSO system provides dedicated integration pathways for five major identity providers plus custom SAML 2.0 compliant providers:

**Primary Supported Providers:**
- **Auth0** - SAML2 addon configuration with client creation
- **Microsoft Azure Active Directory** - Enterprise applications integration
- **G Suite (Google Workspace)** - SAML apps configuration through admin console
- **Okta** - SAML 2.0 app integration via admin dashboard
- **OneLogin** - Direct SAML 2.0 configuration with org ID requirements

**Custom Provider Support:**
- **Other/Custom Providers** - Generic SAML 2.0 compliant identity provider integration through manual configuration

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Components

**Core SAML Configuration Elements:**
- **Entity ID** - Unique identifier for the Amplitude service provider in SAML exchanges
- **Assertion Consumer Service URL (ACS URL)** - Endpoint where SAML assertions are posted after authentication
- **Identity Provider (IdP) Metadata** - XML configuration file containing provider-specific authentication parameters
- **Application Callback URL** - Provider-specific redirect endpoint for post-authentication routing

**Authentication Flow Components:**
- **SAML 2.0 Assertions** - Authentication tokens containing user identity information
- **Email Claim Resolution** - Process for extracting user email addresses from SAML assertions using xmlsoap.org identity claims
- **Just-in-Time (JIT) Provisioning** - Automatic user account creation upon first successful authentication

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The SSO system operates as a centralized authentication layer within Amplitude's organizational access control framework. It manages user authentication while preserving existing project-level permissions and user role assignments. The solution provides organizational-level access control without disrupting granular project permissions for authenticated users, maintaining the separation between authentication (who you are) and authorization (what you can access).

## Configuration Management

**Administrative Interface:**
- **Navigation Path:** Organization Settings > Access & SSO Settings
- **Required Permissions:** Organization administrator privileges
- **Configuration Method:** Identity Provider dropdown selection with metadata file upload

**Integration Workflow Pattern:**
1. **Provider-Side Configuration:**
   - Create/configure application integration in identity provider
   - Set Entity ID and ACS URL parameters
   - Generate and download IdP metadata XML

2. **Amplitude-Side Configuration:**
   - Navigate to Access & SSO Settings
   - Select appropriate identity provider from dropdown
   - Upload IdP metadata file
   - Complete SSO activation
