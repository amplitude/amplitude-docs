# Amplitude Single Sign-On (SSO) Integration

## Product Overview

Amplitude offers Single Sign-On (SSO) integration capabilities that allow organizations to authenticate users through their existing identity providers. This feature is available for Growth and Enterprise plan customers and is based on SAML 2.0 protocol compliance. Amplitude's SSO implementation enables seamless authentication experiences while maintaining security and control over user access to the analytics platform.

### Key Features

- **SAML 2.0 Compliance**: Supports industry-standard SAML 2.0 protocol for secure authentication
- **Multiple Identity Provider Support**: Pre-configured integrations with popular providers (Auth0, G Suite, Azure AD, Okta, OneLogin)
- **Custom Provider Support**: Ability to integrate with any SAML 2.0 compliant identity provider
- **Just-in-Time (JIT) Provisioning**: Automatically creates user accounts upon first successful authentication
- **Required SSO Enforcement**: Option to restrict access exclusively through SSO authentication
- **Email-Based User Identification**: Uses email addresses to match users between systems

## Product Relationships and Architecture

Amplitude's SSO functionality operates as a Service Provider (SP) in the SAML architecture, while external identity systems serve as Identity Providers (IdP). The integration follows a standard SAML 2.0 workflow:

1. User attempts to access Amplitude
2. Amplitude redirects to the configured identity provider
3. User authenticates with the identity provider
4. Identity provider sends a SAML assertion back to Amplitude
5. Amplitude validates the assertion and grants access

Each supported identity provider requires specific configuration parameters:
- **Entity ID**: Uniquely identifies Amplitude as a service provider
- **Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL**: The endpoint where SAML assertions are sent
- **Identity Provider Metadata**: XML file containing the IdP's certificate and endpoints

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **SAML 2.0**: Security Assertion Markup Language, the protocol standard used for SSO authentication
- **Identity Provider (IdP)**: The external system that authenticates users (Auth0, G Suite, etc.)
- **Service Provider (SP)**: Amplitude's role in the SAML relationship
- **Metadata File**: XML document containing configuration details for the identity provider
- **Entity ID**: Unique identifier for Amplitude in the SAML context
- **Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL**: Endpoint where authentication responses are sent
- **Just-in-Time (JIT) Provisioning**: Automatic user creation upon first successful authentication
- **Required SSO**: Setting that forces all users to authenticate via SSO only

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's SSO functionality integrates with the broader Amplitude Analytics platform through the Organization Settings. The SSO configuration is managed at the organization level, affecting all users within that organization. Key integration points include:

- **User Management**: SSO ties into Amplitude's user management system, with email addresses serving as the primary identifier
- **Permission System**: New users created through JIT provisioning receive default project permissions
- **Organization Settings**: SSO is configured through the "Access & SSO Settings" section of Organization Settings

The SSO feature is available only for customers on Growth and Enterprise plans, positioning it as an enterprise-grade security feature within Amplitude's product tiers.

## Configuration Endpoints and Commands

The primary configuration interface for SSO is found at:
- **Organization Settings > Access & SSO Settings**

Key configuration parameters that must be set in Amplitude:
- Identity Provider selection (Auth0, G Suite, Azure AD, Okta, OneLogin, or Other)
- Upload of IdP metadata XML file

Key configuration parameters that must be set in the identity provider:
- **Entity ID**: `https://analytics.amplitude.com/saml/metadata/{org_id}`
- **ACS URL**: `https://analytics.amplitude.com/saml/sso/{org_id}`

Where `{org_id}` is the unique identifier for the Amplitude organization.

For specific providers, additional configuration may be required, such as setting user identifier attributes (typically `user.email` or `user.mail`).
