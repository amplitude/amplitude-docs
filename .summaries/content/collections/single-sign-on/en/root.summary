# Amplitude Single Sign-On (SSO) Integration

## Product Overview

Amplitude offers Single Sign-On (SSO) integration capabilities that allow organizations to authenticate users through their existing identity providers. This feature is available for customers on Growth and Enterprise plans and supports SAML 2.0 compliant identity providers. The SSO integration enables centralized user authentication, enhanced security, and streamlined user management through just-in-time provisioning.

### Key Features

- **SAML 2.0 Compliance**: Supports industry-standard SAML 2.0 protocol for secure authentication
- **Multiple Identity Provider Support**: Pre-configured integrations with popular providers (Auth0, G Suite, Azure Active Directory, Okta, OneLogin)
- **Custom Provider Support**: Ability to integrate with any SAML 2.0 compliant identity provider
- **Just-in-Time Provisioning**: Automatic user creation in Amplitude when users authenticate via SSO
- **SSO Enforcement Options**: Configurable policies for requiring SSO authentication
- **User Identification**: Uses email addresses from SAML assertions to identify and provision users

## Product Relationships and Architecture

Amplitude's SSO functionality sits within the broader user management and security framework of the platform. The integration follows a standard SAML 2.0 workflow:

1. **Identity Provider (IdP)**: External authentication system (Auth0, G Suite, etc.)
2. **Service Provider (SP)**: Amplitude platform
3. **Metadata Exchange**: Configuration data shared between IdP and Amplitude
4. **Authentication Flow**: User authentication requests routed through the IdP

The SSO configuration is managed at the organization level through the Organization Settings > Access & SSO Settings interface in Amplitude. This centralized approach ensures consistent authentication policies across all projects within an organization.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **SAML 2.0**: Security Assertion Markup Language, the protocol standard used for SSO authentication
- **Identity Provider (IdP)**: The external system that authenticates users (Auth0, G Suite, etc.)
- **Service Provider (SP)**: Amplitude, which relies on the IdP for authentication
- **Metadata File**: XML file containing configuration details from the IdP
- **Entity ID**: Unique identifier for Amplitude in the SAML configuration
- **Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL**: Endpoint where Amplitude receives SAML assertions
- **Just-in-Time (JIT) Provisioning**: Automatic user creation upon first successful authentication
- **SAML Assertion**: Data package containing user authentication information
- **SSO Enforcement**: Policy requiring users to authenticate via SSO

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's SSO functionality integrates with the broader Amplitude Analytics platform, providing secure access to analytics data and tools. The SSO system connects to:

1. **User Management System**: Controls access permissions and project visibility
2. **Organization Settings**: Central configuration hub for SSO and access policies
3. **Project Access Controls**: Default project access for new users created through JIT provisioning

The SSO integration serves as the gateway to the Amplitude platform, ensuring that only authenticated users from the organization's identity system can access analytics data and tools.

## Implementation Details

### Configuration Endpoints

For all SSO providers, Amplitude requires:
- **Entity ID**: `https://analytics.amplitude.com/saml/metadata/{organizationId}`
- **ACS URL**: `https://analytics.amplitude.com/saml/sso/{organizationId}`

### Provider-Specific Setup Processes

1. **Auth0**:
   - Create Auth0 client
   - Configure SAML2 settings with Amplitude's Entity ID and ACS URL
   - Download certificate metadata and upload to Amplitude

2. **Azure Active Directory**:
   - Configure Enterprise application in Azure portal
   - Set identifier values and user.mail as identifier
   - Download metadata XML and upload to Amplitude

3. **G Suite**:
   - Configure SAML app in G Suite admin console
   - Set ACS URL and Entity ID
   - Download IDP metadata and upload to Amplitude
   - Enable the SAML app for appropriate users

4. **Okta**:
   - Create SAML 2.0 app integration
   - Configure with Amplitude's Entity ID and ACS URL
   - Download IdP metadata and upload to Amplitude

5. **OneLogin**:
   - Configure SAML2.0 app with Amplitude org ID
   - Download SAML metadata file
   - Upload to Amplitude's SSO settings

6. **Custom/Unlisted Providers**:
   - Configure SAML 2.0 settings in the provider
   - Use Amplitude's Entity ID and ACS URL
   - Generate metadata file from provider
   - Upload to Amplitude's SSO settings

All SSO configurations are managed through the Organization Settings > Access & SSO Settings interface in Amplitude.
