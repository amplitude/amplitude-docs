## Amplitude Single Sign-On (SSO) Product Overview

Amplitude's Single Sign-On solution provides SAML 2.0-based authentication integration that enables organizations to centrally manage user access through their existing identity providers. The SSO functionality is available on Growth and Enterprise plans and supports just-in-time (JIT) provisioning for seamless user onboarding.

## Supported Identity Providers and Integration Architecture

The SSO system supports five major identity providers through dedicated integration pathways:

**Primary Supported Providers:**
- **Auth0** - SAML2 addon configuration with client creation
- **Microsoft Azure Active Directory** - Enterprise applications integration
- **G Suite (Google Workspace)** - SAML apps configuration through admin console
- **Okta** - SAML 2.0 app integration via admin dashboard
- **OneLogin** - Direct SAML 2.0 configuration with org ID requirements

**Custom Provider Support:**
- **Other/Custom Providers** - Generic SAML 2.0 compliant identity provider integration through manual configuration

## Key Technical Components and Nomenclature

**Core SAML Configuration Elements:**
- **Entity ID** - Unique identifier for the Amplitude service provider in SAML exchanges
- **Assertion Consumer Service URL (ACS URL)** - Endpoint where SAML assertions are posted after authentication
- **Identity Provider (IdP) Metadata** - XML configuration file containing provider-specific authentication parameters
- **Application Callback URL** - Provider-specific redirect endpoint for post-authentication routing

**Authentication Flow Components:**
- **SAML 2.0 Assertions** - Authentication tokens containing user identity information
- **Email Claim Resolution** - Process for extracting user email addresses from SAML assertions using xmlsoap.org identity claims
- **Just-in-Time (JIT) Provisioning** - Automatic user account creation upon first successful authentication

## Configuration Management Interface

All SSO configurations are managed through Amplitude's administrative interface:
- **Navigation Path:** Organization Settings > Access & SSO Settings
- **Required Permissions:** Organization administrator privileges
- **Configuration Method:** Identity Provider dropdown selection with metadata file upload

## Integration Workflow Pattern

Each identity provider follows a consistent integration pattern:

1. **Provider-Side Configuration:**
   - Create/configure application integration in identity provider
   - Set Entity ID and ACS URL parameters
   - Generate and download IdP metadata XML

2. **Amplitude-Side Configuration:**
   - Navigate to Access & SSO Settings
   - Select appropriate identity provider from dropdown
   - Upload IdP metadata file
   - Complete SSO activation

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The SSO system integrates with Amplitude's broader organizational access control framework, managing authentication while preserving existing project-level permissions and user role assignments. The solution supports organizational-level access control while maintaining granular project permissions for authenticated users.
