# Amplitude Unreal SDK

## Overview
The Amplitude Unreal SDK enables developers to implement Amplitude analytics tracking within Unreal Engine projects. It provides a comprehensive solution for capturing user behavior, tracking events, and managing user properties by leveraging Unreal Engine's native analytics provider interface.

## Key Features and Capabilities
- Seamless integration with Unreal Engine's analytics provider interface (IAnalyticsProvider)
- Event tracking with customizable properties
- User identification and property management
- Session tracking and management
- Plugin-based installation for straightforward integration into Unreal Engine projects

## Product Relationships and Architecture
The Amplitude Unreal SDK functions as a bridge between Unreal Engine applications and the Amplitude analytics platform. By implementing Unreal's IAnalyticsProvider interface, the SDK allows developers to:

1. Collect analytics data within their Unreal Engine applications
2. Transmit this data to Amplitude's backend systems
3. Access Amplitude's analytics tools and dashboards for data analysis

The SDK operates as a plugin within the Unreal Engine ecosystem, making it compatible with the engine's existing analytics infrastructure while extending functionality to connect with Amplitude's specialized analytics services.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions
- **AmplitudeUnreal**: The primary namespace/class for the SDK implementation
- **IAnalyticsProvider**: The Unreal Engine interface that the SDK implements to provide analytics functionality
- **Event Properties**: Key-value pairs that add contextual information to tracked events
- **User Properties**: Attributes associated with specific users for segmentation and analysis
- **Analytics Provider**: The implementation that conforms to Unreal's interface requirements for analytics tracking
- **Session**: A period of user engagement with the application that is tracked as a cohesive unit

## Integration with Product Ecosystem
The Amplitude Unreal SDK serves as a critical component in a larger analytics ecosystem:

1. **Data Collection**: The SDK captures user interactions and events within Unreal Engine applications
2. **Data Transmission**: Collected data is sent to Amplitude's analytics platform
3. **Data Analysis**: Developers can use Amplitude's suite of analytics tools to analyze user behavior
4. **Insights Application**: Analytics insights can inform game development decisions and improvements

The SDK leverages Unreal Engine's native analytics interfaces while extending functionality to connect with Amplitude's specialized analytics platform, providing developers with powerful tools for understanding user behavior and improving their applications.

## API Methods
Key methods provided by the SDK include:
- `RecordEvent`: Logs an event to Amplitude with optional event properties
- `SetUserID`: Associates analytics data with a specific user identifier
- `StartSession`: Initializes an analytics tracking session
- User property management methods for attaching metadata to users

These methods allow developers to implement comprehensive analytics tracking within their Unreal Engine projects while maintaining compatibility with Unreal's native systems.
