# Amplitude Unreal SDK

## Overview
The Amplitude Unreal SDK is an analytics integration solution that enables developers to incorporate Amplitude's analytics capabilities into Unreal Engine projects. The SDK facilitates tracking user behavior, collecting event data, and analyzing user interactions within Unreal Engine applications and games.

## Key Features
- Analytics event tracking through Unreal Engine's native analytics provider interface
- User identification and property management
- Custom event properties support
- Session management
- Seamless integration with Unreal Engine projects

## Product Architecture and Relationships
The Amplitude Unreal SDK is implemented as `AmplitudeUnreal`, which conforms to Unreal Engine's `IAnalyticsProvider` interface. This implementation allows the SDK to function as a drop-in analytics provider within the Unreal Engine ecosystem while sending data to Amplitude's analytics platform. The SDK is installed as a plugin within Unreal Engine projects, making it a component of both the Unreal Engine development environment and the Amplitude analytics ecosystem.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions
- **AmplitudeUnreal**: The main class implementing Unreal Engine's analytics provider interface
- **IAnalyticsProvider**: Unreal Engine interface for analytics providers that the SDK implements
- **Event Properties**: Additional data points attached to specific events (implemented as `FAnalyticsEventAttribute` arrays)
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes associated with a specific user
- **Analytics Session**: A period of continuous user interaction with the application
- **StartSession**: Function that initializes an analytics session with Amplitude
- **RecordEvent**: Function that logs custom events with optional properties to Amplitude
- **SetUserID**: Function that associates analytics data with specific user identifiers
- **SetUserProperty**: Function that sets persistent properties for the current user

## Ecosystem Integration
The Amplitude Unreal SDK is part of Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem, which includes SDKs for various platforms and programming languages. Data collected through the Unreal SDK can be analyzed alongside data from other platforms in Amplitude's analytics dashboard. Within the Unreal Engine environment, the SDK leverages the engine's native analytics framework, ensuring compatibility with existing Unreal Engine projects and workflows.

## API Usage
The SDK is accessed through Unreal Engine's analytics interface. Key API calls include:

```
// Start an analytics session
FAnalytics::Get().GetDefaultConfiguredProvider()->StartSession();

// Record a simple event
FAnalytics::Get().GetDefaultConfiguredProvider()->RecordEvent("LevelCompleted");

// Record an event with properties
TArray<FAnalyticsEventAttribute> EventAttributes;
EventAttributes.Add(FAnalyticsEventAttribute("score", 100));
EventAttributes.Add(FAnalyticsEventAttribute("time_spent", 300));
FAnalytics::Get().GetDefaultConfiguredProvider()->RecordEvent("LevelCompleted", EventAttributes);

// Set a user ID
FAnalytics::Get().GetDefaultConfiguredProvider()->SetUserID("user-123");

// Set user properties
FAnalytics::Get().GetDefaultConfiguredProvider()->SetUserProperty("subscription_type", "premium");
```

These API calls allow developers to track specific user actions and behaviors by recording events with custom properties, which can then be used to analyze user engagement, feature usage, and application performance within the Amplitude analytics platform.
