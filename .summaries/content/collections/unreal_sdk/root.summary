# Amplitude Unreal SDK

## Overview
The Amplitude Unreal SDK enables developers to integrate Amplitude's analytics capabilities into Unreal Engine projects. This SDK allows for tracking user behavior, collecting event data, and analyzing user interactions within games and applications built with Unreal Engine.

## Key Features and Capabilities
- Event tracking with custom properties
- User identification and property management
- Session tracking and management
- Integration with Unreal Engine's native analytics provider interface
- Plugin-based installation for seamless integration

## Product Architecture and Relationships
The Amplitude Unreal SDK is implemented as an Unreal Engine plugin that integrates with the engine's existing analytics framework. The core component is the `AmplitudeUnreal` class, which implements Unreal's `IAnalyticsProvider` interface to provide analytics functionality within the Unreal environment.

The SDK serves as a bridge between Unreal Engine applications and Amplitude's analytics platform, sending tracked events and user data to Amplitude's servers for processing and visualization.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions
- **AmplitudeUnreal**: The main implementation class providing Amplitude analytics functionality
- **IAnalyticsProvider**: Unreal Engine's interface for analytics providers that AmplitudeUnreal implements
- **Events**: Data points representing user actions or occurrences within the application
- **Event Properties**: Additional contextual data attached to events
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes associated with a user across sessions
- **Sessions**: Periods of user engagement with the application

## Integration with Product Ecosystem
The Amplitude Unreal SDK is part of Amplitude's broader analytics platform, which includes:
- SDKs for various platforms and frameworks
- Web-based analytics dashboard for data visualization and analysis
- User segmentation and targeting capabilities
- Cross-platform user tracking

The Unreal SDK specifically enables developers working with Unreal Engine to connect their applications to this ecosystem, allowing them to leverage Amplitude's analytics tools while maintaining compatibility with Unreal's development workflow.

## API Methods
Key API methods include:
- `StartSession()`: Initializes an analytics session
- `RecordEvent(EventName, [Properties])`: Logs an event with optional properties
- `SetUserID(UserID)`: Associates analytics data with a specific user
- `SetUserProperty(PropertyName, PropertyValue)`: Sets persistent properties for the current user

These methods allow developers to track specific user actions, associate data with user profiles, and manage analytics sessions within their Unreal Engine applications.
