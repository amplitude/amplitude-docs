## Amplitude Unreal SDK

The Amplitude Unreal SDK is a beta analytics integration that enables Unreal Engine developers to implement comprehensive event tracking and user analytics within their games and applications. The SDK provides seamless integration with Unreal Engine's built-in analytics framework through the IAnalyticsProvider interface.

## Product Features and Capabilities

The SDK delivers core analytics functionality including:

- **Event Tracking**: Comprehensive event logging using the `RecordEvent` method with support for custom attributes via `FAnalyticsEventAttribute`
- **User Management**: User identification and property tracking through `SetUserID` and custom user property methods
- **Session Management**: Built-in session lifecycle management with `StartSession` and `EndSession` methods
- **Native Integration**: Leverages Unreal Engine's standard analytics architecture for consistent implementation patterns

## Installation and Configuration

The SDK follows Unreal Engine's standard plugin architecture:

- **Distribution**: Delivered as `AmplitudeUnreal.zip` package
- **Installation**: Manual extraction to the project's Plugins directory
- **Configuration**: Enabled through UE4 Editor Analytics Settings in Project Settings
- **Integration**: Accessed via `FAnalytics::Get().GetDefaultConfiguredProvider()` for the configured Amplitude provider

## Technical Implementation

### Core Interface
The SDK implements Unreal Engine's `IAnalyticsProvider` interface, ensuring compatibility with existing analytics workflows and allowing developers to use familiar Unreal analytics patterns.

### Key Methods and APIs
- `RecordEvent()`: Primary event tracking method supporting custom event attributes
- `StartSession()`/`EndSession()`: Session lifecycle management
- `SetUserID()`: User identification for cross-session tracking
- User property methods for demographic and behavioral data collection

### Development Integration
- Requires C++ analytics headers for implementation
- Integrates with Project Settings Analytics configuration
- Supports both Blueprint and C++ implementation patterns through Unreal's analytics framework

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **IAnalyticsProvider**: Unreal Engine's standard interface for analytics implementations
- **FAnalyticsEventAttribute**: Unreal Engine's data structure for event properties and custom attributes
- **AmplitudeUnreal.zip**: The SDK distribution package containing the plugin files
- **Analytics Settings**: UE4 Editor configuration panel for enabling and configuring analytics providers
- **Session**: A period of user engagement tracked from StartSession to EndSession calls

## Product Ecosystem Position

The Amplitude Unreal SDK serves as a specialized connector within the broader Amplitude analytics ecosystem, specifically designed for game developers and interactive application creators using Unreal Engine. It maintains consistency with Amplitude's cross-platform analytics approach while leveraging Unreal Engine's native analytics infrastructure.

The beta status indicates active development with potential API changes, positioning this as an evolving solution for Unreal Engine developers seeking robust analytics capabilities within the Amplitude ecosystem. The SDK bridges the gap between Amplitude's comprehensive analytics platform and Unreal Engine's game development environment, enabling developers to leverage Amplitude's advanced analytics features while maintaining familiar Unreal Engine development patterns.
