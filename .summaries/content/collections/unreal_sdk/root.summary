# Amplitude Unreal SDK

## Overview
The Amplitude Unreal SDK enables developers to integrate Amplitude's analytics capabilities into Unreal Engine projects. This SDK allows tracking of user behavior, event data collection, and analysis of user interactions within Unreal Engine applications and games.

## Key Features and Capabilities
- Event tracking with custom properties
- User identification and property management
- Native integration with Unreal Engine's analytics provider interface
- Session management for tracking user engagement
- Plugin-based installation for seamless integration

## Product Relationships and Architecture
The Amplitude Unreal SDK functions as a plugin within the Unreal Engine ecosystem. It implements Unreal Engine's IAnalyticsProvider interface, allowing it to work within the engine's existing analytics framework. The SDK serves as a bridge between Unreal applications and Amplitude's analytics backend, sending collected data to Amplitude's servers for processing and visualization through Amplitude's dashboard.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions
- **AmplitudeUnreal**: The main implementation class providing analytics functionality within Unreal Engine projects
- **IAnalyticsProvider**: Unreal Engine's interface for analytics providers that AmplitudeUnreal implements
- **Events**: Data points representing user actions or occurrences within the application
- **Event Properties**: Additional contextual data attached to events
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes associated with specific users
- **Sessions**: Periods of user engagement with the application

## Ecosystem Integration
The Unreal SDK is part of Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem, which includes SDKs for various platforms. This specific SDK targets game and application developers using Unreal Engine, allowing them to incorporate Amplitude's analytics while maintaining familiar Unreal development workflows. Data collected through the SDK can be analyzed through Amplitude's web dashboard and reporting tools.

## Key Methods and Implementation
- **StartSession**: Initializes an analytics session
- **RecordEvent**: Logs events with optional properties
- **SetUserID**: Associates analytics data with specific user identifiers
- **SetUserProperty**: Sets persistent properties for the current user

The SDK can be used either through Unreal's standard analytics interfaces or directly through the AmplitudeUnreal implementation, providing flexibility for different development approaches.
