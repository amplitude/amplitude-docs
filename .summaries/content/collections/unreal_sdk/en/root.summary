# Amplitude Unreal SDK

## Overview
The Amplitude Unreal SDK is an analytics integration solution that allows developers to incorporate Amplitude's analytics capabilities into Unreal Engine projects. The SDK enables tracking user behavior, collecting event data, and analyzing user interactions within Unreal Engine applications and games.

## Key Features
- Event tracking and logging with custom properties
- User identification and user property management
- Integration with Unreal Engine's native analytics provider interface
- Session management for tracking user engagement periods
- Plugin-based installation for easy integration into Unreal projects

## Core Concepts and Nomenclature

### AmplitudeUnreal
The main implementation class that provides the analytics functionality for Amplitude within Unreal Engine projects. This class implements the IAnalyticsProvider interface from Unreal Engine.

### IAnalyticsProvider
Unreal Engine's interface for analytics providers that AmplitudeUnreal implements, allowing it to integrate seamlessly with Unreal's analytics framework.

### Events
Data points that represent user actions or occurrences within the application. Events can include additional context through properties.

### Event Properties
Additional data attached to events that provide context and details about the specific occurrence of an event.

### User Properties
Attributes associated with a specific user that persist across sessions, helping to segment and analyze user behavior.

### Sessions
Periods of user engagement with the application, typically starting when a user opens the app and ending when they close it or after a period of inactivity.

## Integration and Implementation

### Installation
The Amplitude Unreal SDK is installed as a plugin within Unreal Engine projects.

### Key Methods

- **StartSession**: Initializes an analytics session for tracking user engagement
- **RecordEvent**: Logs an event with optional properties to track user actions
- **SetUserID**: Associates analytics data with a specific user identifier
- **SetUserProperty**: Sets persistent properties for the current user

### Usage in Unreal Engine

The SDK integrates with Unreal Engine's analytics framework, allowing developers to use Amplitude through Unreal's standard analytics interfaces or directly through the AmplitudeUnreal implementation.

## Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude Unreal SDK is part of Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem, which includes SDKs for various platforms. The Unreal SDK specifically targets game and application developers using the Unreal Engine development environment, allowing them to incorporate Amplitude's analytics capabilities into their projects while maintaining the workflow and patterns familiar to Unreal developers.

The SDK serves as a bridge between Unreal Engine applications and Amplitude's analytics backend, enabling developers to send data to Amplitude's servers for processing, visualization, and analysis through Amplitude's web dashboard and reporting tools.
