# Amplitude Unreal SDK

## Overview
The Amplitude Unreal SDK is an analytics integration solution that allows developers to incorporate Amplitude's analytics capabilities into Unreal Engine projects. The SDK enables tracking user behavior, collecting event data, and analyzing user interactions within Unreal Engine applications and games.

## Key Features
- Analytics event tracking through Unreal Engine's native analytics provider interface
- User identification and property management
- Custom event properties support
- Session management
- Seamless integration with Unreal Engine projects

## Core Concepts and Implementation

### Integration Method
The Amplitude Unreal SDK implements Unreal Engine's `IAnalyticsProvider` interface, allowing it to function as a drop-in analytics provider within the Unreal Engine ecosystem. This approach ensures compatibility with Unreal's existing analytics framework.

### Key Functions
- **StartSession**: Initializes an analytics session with Amplitude
- **RecordEvent**: Logs custom events with optional properties to Amplitude
- **SetUserID**: Associates analytics data with specific user identifiers
- **SetUserProperty**: Sets persistent properties for the current user

### Event Tracking
The SDK allows developers to track specific user actions and behaviors by recording events with custom properties. These events can be used to analyze user engagement, feature usage, and application performance.

### User Management
Developers can set and manage user properties to segment analytics data and create cohorts for analysis. The SDK supports custom user IDs to track individual users across sessions.

## Installation and Setup
The SDK is installed as a plugin within Unreal Engine projects. Detailed installation instructions are provided in the documentation, guiding developers through the process of integrating the SDK into their projects.

## Technical Implementation
The SDK is implemented as `AmplitudeUnreal`, which conforms to Unreal Engine's analytics provider interface. This allows developers to use familiar Unreal Engine analytics methods while sending data to Amplitude's analytics platform.

## Ecosystem Integration
The Amplitude Unreal SDK is part of Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem, which includes SDKs for various platforms and programming languages. Data collected through the Unreal SDK can be analyzed alongside data from other platforms in Amplitude's analytics dashboard.

## API Usage Examples
```
// Start an analytics session
FAnalytics::Get().GetDefaultConfiguredProvider()->StartSession();

// Record a simple event
FAnalytics::Get().GetDefaultConfiguredProvider()->RecordEvent("LevelCompleted");

// Record an event with properties
TArray<FAnalyticsEventAttribute> EventAttributes;
EventAttributes.Add(FAnalyticsEventAttribute("score", 100));
EventAttributes.Add(FAnalyticsEventAttribute("time_spent", 300));
FAnalytics::Get().GetDefaultConfiguredProvider()->RecordEvent("LevelCompleted", EventAttributes);

// Set a user ID
FAnalytics::Get().GetDefaultConfiguredProvider()->SetUserID("user-123");

// Set user properties
FAnalytics::Get().GetDefaultConfiguredProvider()->SetUserProperty("subscription_type", "premium");
```

## Key Nomenclature
- **AmplitudeUnreal**: The main class implementing Unreal Engine's analytics provider interface
- **IAnalyticsProvider**: Unreal Engine interface for analytics providers
- **Event Properties**: Additional data points attached to specific events
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes associated with a specific user
- **Analytics Session**: A period of continuous user interaction with the application
