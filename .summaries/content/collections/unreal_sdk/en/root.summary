# Amplitude Unreal SDK

## Overview
The Amplitude Unreal SDK is an analytics integration solution that allows developers to implement Amplitude analytics tracking within Unreal Engine projects. The SDK provides a way to capture user behavior, track events, and manage user properties through Unreal Engine's native analytics provider interface.

## Key Features
- Integration with Unreal Engine's analytics provider interface (IAnalyticsProvider)
- Event tracking with custom properties
- User identification and user property management
- Session management
- Plugin-based installation for Unreal Engine projects

## Core Concepts and Functionality

### Analytics Provider Integration
The SDK implements Unreal Engine's IAnalyticsProvider interface, allowing it to be used as a drop-in analytics solution within the Unreal Engine ecosystem. This enables developers to use Amplitude analytics through Unreal's standard analytics interfaces.

### Event Tracking
The primary functionality of the SDK is to record events that represent user actions or system occurrences within the game or application. Events can be enriched with custom properties to provide additional context.

Key methods:
- `RecordEvent`: Logs an event to Amplitude with optional event properties

### User Management
The SDK supports user identification and property management:
- `SetUserID`: Associates analytics data with a specific user identifier
- Setting user properties: Allows attaching metadata to users for segmentation and analysis

### Session Management
The SDK handles analytics sessions through:
- `StartSession`: Initializes an analytics tracking session

## Installation and Setup
The Amplitude Unreal SDK is installed as a plugin within Unreal Engine projects. The documentation provides step-by-step instructions for integrating the SDK into Unreal projects.

## Key Nomenclature
- **AmplitudeUnreal**: The main class/namespace for the SDK
- **IAnalyticsProvider**: Unreal Engine interface that the SDK implements
- **Event Properties**: Key-value pairs that provide additional context for analytics events
- **User Properties**: Attributes associated with a specific user for segmentation purposes
- **Analytics Provider**: The implementation of analytics functionality that conforms to Unreal's interface requirements

## Integration with Broader Ecosystem
The Amplitude Unreal SDK connects Unreal Engine applications to the broader Amplitude analytics platform. By implementing Unreal's standard analytics provider interface, the SDK allows seamless integration with Unreal's existing analytics infrastructure while sending data to Amplitude's backend for analysis, visualization, and insights.

The SDK serves as a bridge between game development in Unreal Engine and sophisticated analytics capabilities provided by the Amplitude platform, enabling developers to make data-driven decisions about their games and applications.
