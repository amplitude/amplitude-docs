# Amplitude API Platform Overview

The Amplitude API Platform provides programmatic access to Amplitude's analytics, experimentation, and user engagement capabilities through a comprehensive suite of APIs organized into distinct categories.

## Key Features and Capabilities

- **Analytics APIs**: Access user behavior data, metrics, and reporting capabilities
- **Experiment APIs**: Control feature flags, A/B tests, and experimentation programmatically
- **Guides and Surveys APIs**: Create and manage in-app user guides and feedback collection
- **Secure Authentication**: Multiple authentication mechanisms using various keys and tokens

## Product Relationships and Structure

The Amplitude API platform consists of several interconnected product areas:

1. **Amplitude Analytics**: Core analytics platform tracking user behavior and providing insights
2. **Amplitude Experiment**: Feature flagging and experimentation platform for testing variations
3. **Amplitude Guides and Surveys**: Tools for in-app user engagement and feedback collection
4. **Amplitude Data**: APIs for data management and integration

While these products are interconnected, each has separate authentication mechanisms and API endpoints, with dedicated documentation sections for authentication, credential management, and specific API endpoints.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Authentication Credentials

- **API Key**: Public identifier for an Amplitude Analytics project (client-side implementations)
- **Secret Key**: Private credential for server-side authentication with Analytics APIs
- **Deployment Keys**: Used for Amplitude Experiment (separate keys for development/production)
- **Management API Key**: For programmatic management of Experiment configurations
- **Data API Token**: For authenticating with Amplitude Data APIs
- **SCIM Key**: For user provisioning and management
- **Org-level Keys**: Organization-wide authentication credentials

### Public vs. Private Keys

- **Public Keys**: Safe for client-side code (API Key, Experiment Deployment Keys)
- **Private Keys**: Must be kept secure on servers (Secret Key, Management API Key, Data API Token)

### Key Rotation

Rotatable credentials:
- Secret Key
- Management API Key
- Data API Token
- SCIM Key

Non-rotatable credentials:
- API Key
- Deployment Keys

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude API platform serves as the programmatic interface to Amplitude's broader product ecosystem:

1. **Analytics** forms the foundation by collecting and processing user behavior data
2. **Experiment** leverages this data for feature flagging and A/B testing
3. **Guides and Surveys** uses insights to target and personalize user engagement
4. **Data** APIs facilitate integration with external systems and data pipelines

Together, these components provide a complete platform for product analytics, experimentation, and user engagement, accessible both through the web application and programmatically via APIs.

## API Access and Management

To access the APIs:

1. Navigate to the Amplitude web application
2. Go to Settings > Projects to find the API Key and Secret Key for Analytics
3. Access different keys in their respective product sections
4. Use the appropriate authentication credentials for each API endpoint
5. Follow security best practices by keeping private keys secure and using server-side authentication when appropriate

The documentation includes detailed tables of available API endpoints for each product area, with links to specific API documentation containing endpoints, parameters, and usage examples.
