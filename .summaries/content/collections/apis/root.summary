## Amplitude Analytics and Experimentation Platform

Amplitude provides a comprehensive analytics and experimentation platform consisting of three core product areas: **Analytics** for event tracking and user behavior analysis, **Experiment** for A/B testing and feature flagging, and **Guides & Surveys** for user engagement and feedback collection. The platform operates as an integrated ecosystem where data flows seamlessly between products, with Analytics serving as the foundational data layer that informs experimentation decisions and user engagement strategies.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The platform architecture centers around **Analytics APIs** as the core data foundation, capturing user events and behaviors that feed into reporting and analysis capabilities. **Experiment APIs** build upon this analytics infrastructure to deliver A/B testing and feature flagging functionality, measuring experiment performance and feature adoption through the underlying analytics system. **Guides and Surveys APIs** extend platform capabilities into user engagement, tracking interactions with in-app guides and survey responses through the same analytics foundation.

All products share a unified authentication system while maintaining distinct API surfaces optimized for their specific use cases. This shared authentication layer enables seamless data integration across products while providing appropriate security controls for different implementation scenarios.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Authentication Credentials:**
- **Project API Key**: Public identifier for Analytics projects, designed for safe client-side use in browsers and mobile applications
- **Project Secret Key**: Private credential for Analytics requiring secure server-side storage, with copying restrictions and no regeneration capability
- **Deployment Key**: Experiment product authentication credential supporting both client-side and server-side implementations
- **Management API Key**: Organization-level credential enabling administrative operations across all Amplitude products
- **Data API Token**: Specialized credential for data export and import operations with external systems
- **SCIM Key**: Dedicated credential for user provisioning and identity management workflows

**Access Control:**
- **Manager Role**: Required permission level for accessing and generating API credentials within the platform
- **Organization Settings**: Central credential management interface accessible via analytics.amplitude.com
- **Project-specific Credentials**: Authentication tokens scoped to individual Analytics projects
- **Org-level API Key**: Credentials providing organization-wide access permissions

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude operates as a unified analytics and experimentation ecosystem with tiered security architecture. The authentication system implements security levels ranging from public keys for client-side data ingestion to private keys for sensitive server-side operations, with specialized tokens for data management and user provisioning. This tiered approach enables organizations to implement appropriate security measures based on integration requirements and deployment contexts.

The platform integrates with external systems through **SCIM** for user management and identity provisioning, while **Data API Tokens** enable integration with data warehouses and business intelligence tools. Analytics data serves as the foundation for cross-product functionality, informing experiment design, measuring feature impact, and tracking user engagement with guides and surveys.

## API Access and Implementation

**Credential Management Workflow:**
1. Access Organization Settings through analytics.amplitude.com
2. Navigate to API Keys sidebar (requires Manager role permissions)
3. Generate project-specific or organization-level credentials based on use case
4. Implement appropriate credential types for client-side versus server-side requirements

**Security Implementation:**
- Secret keys have restricted copying capabilities and cannot be regenerated once created
- Credential types are optimized for specific deployment scenarios (browser ingestion, mobile applications, server-side operations)
- Role-based access controls restrict credential generation to authorized Manager-level users
- Different authentication tokens provide scoped access appropriate to their intended use cases

The API documentation is organized through collection-based structure, providing developers with specific endpoint references for Analytics, Experiment, and Guides & Surveys functionality, enabling targeted integration based on product requirements.
