# Amplitude Product Suite

## Overview
Amplitude is a comprehensive analytics and experimentation platform designed to help organizations collect, analyze, and act on user behavior data. The platform enables data-driven decision making by providing insights into how users interact with applications and websites, allowing teams to improve product experiences through experimentation and user feedback.

## Product Ecosystem

### Core Products
1. **Amplitude Analytics** - The foundation of the platform that tracks and analyzes user behavior data
2. **Amplitude Experiment** - A feature experimentation platform for testing variations and measuring impact
3. **Amplitude Guides and Surveys** - Tools for in-product guidance and user feedback collection

These products form an integrated ecosystem with a closed feedback loop:
- Analytics collects and processes behavioral data
- Experiment uses this data to test hypotheses
- Guides and Surveys engage users and collect qualitative feedback

## API Structure

Amplitude organizes its APIs into three main categories:

### 1. Analytics APIs
For sending and retrieving analytics data about user behavior

### 2. Experiment APIs
For managing and evaluating feature experiments

### 3. Guides and Surveys APIs
For creating and managing in-product guides and collecting user feedback

## Authentication System

Amplitude implements a multi-tiered authentication system with different credentials for specific purposes:

### Analytics Authentication
- **API Key**: Project-specific public identifier for client-side implementations
- **Secret Key**: Private key for secure server-side implementations

### Experiment Authentication
- **Deployment Keys**: Used to fetch experiment configurations
- **Management API Key**: Used for programmatic experiment management

### Data Authentication
- **API Token**: Required for accessing Amplitude Data APIs

### Additional Authentication Methods
- **SCIM Key**: For user provisioning integrations
- **Organization-level Keys**: For organization-wide operations

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **API Key**: Public project identifier that can be safely exposed in client-side code
- **Secret Key**: Private authentication credential that must never be exposed publicly
- **Deployment Key**: Authentication credential for retrieving experiment configurations
- **Management API Key**: Authentication credential for programmatic experiment management
- **API Token**: Authentication token specifically for Data APIs
- **SCIM Key**: Authentication credential for automated user provisioning

The platform distinguishes between:
- **Public keys**: Safe for client-side use (API Keys, Deployment Keys)
- **Private keys**: For server-side use only (Secret Keys, Management API Keys)

Each key type has different security implications and rotation capabilities.

## Access Management

Authentication credentials can be accessed through the Organization Settings in the Amplitude Analytics web application. Users require Manager role permissions to access these credentials.
