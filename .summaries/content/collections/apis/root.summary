# Amplitude API Platform Overview

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude provides a comprehensive API platform that enables developers to integrate with and extend Amplitude's analytics, experimentation, and engagement products. The platform consists of three main product areas:

1. **Analytics APIs** - Access and manage analytics data
2. **Experiment APIs** - Manage and implement A/B tests and feature flags
3. **Guides and Surveys APIs** - Create and manage in-app user guides and surveys

These APIs allow developers to programmatically interact with Amplitude's ecosystem, enabling custom integrations, automated workflows, and extended functionality beyond the standard web interface.

## Product and Feature Relationships

The Amplitude API platform demonstrates a hierarchical relationship between products:

- **Analytics** serves as the foundation, collecting and processing user behavior data
- **Experiment** builds upon Analytics data to power A/B tests and feature flags
- **Guides and Surveys** utilizes insights from both Analytics and Experiment to deliver targeted in-app experiences

Each product area contains multiple specialized APIs that serve specific functions within that domain. The APIs are designed to work together seamlessly while maintaining distinct authentication mechanisms and endpoints appropriate to their use cases.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Authentication Credentials
- **API Key**: Public identifier for an Amplitude project, primarily used with Analytics
- **Secret Key**: Private credential that should never be exposed in client-side code
- **Deployment Keys**: Used with Experiment for client-side implementations
- **Management API Key**: Used with Experiment for server-side operations
- **Data API Token**: Used for accessing Amplitude Data
- **SCIM Key**: Used for user provisioning and management
- **Organization-level Keys**: Used for organization-wide operations

### Credential Classifications
- **Public Keys**: Safe for client-side code (API Key, Deployment Keys)
- **Private Keys**: For secure server environments only (Secret Key, Management API Key)
- **Project-specific Keys**: Tied to a specific Amplitude project
- **Organization-level Keys**: Apply across all projects within an organization

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude API platform is designed as an integrated ecosystem where:

1. **Analytics APIs** provide the data foundation, allowing applications to send events, query user properties, and access behavioral data
2. **Experiment APIs** leverage this data to implement and manage experiments, feature flags, and targeted experiences
3. **Guides and Surveys APIs** complete the loop by enabling targeted in-app messaging and feedback collection based on user behavior and experiment results

This integration allows developers to build comprehensive workflows that span the entire user lifecycle from data collection to experimentation to engagement.

## API Structure and Implementation

The API documentation is organized in tables that list each API with its corresponding description. The documentation appears to be dynamically generated using collection tags like:
- `{{collection:api}}` 
- `{{collection:experiment-apis}}`
- `{{collection:guides_and_surveys_api}}`

These tags populate the tables with available APIs and their summaries, suggesting a modular documentation approach that maintains consistency as the API platform evolves.

While specific API endpoints aren't explicitly listed in the overview, the documentation indicates that each product category contains multiple specialized APIs with their own endpoints, authentication requirements, and usage patterns.
