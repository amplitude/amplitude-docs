# Amplitude Product Suite

## Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive analytics and experimentation platform designed to help organizations collect, analyze, and act on user behavior data to improve product experiences. The platform consists of several interconnected products that work together to provide a complete solution for understanding user behavior and optimizing digital products.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Amplitude platform consists of three core products that work together in an integrated ecosystem:

1. **Amplitude Analytics** - The foundation of the platform that collects and processes user behavior data
2. **Amplitude Experiment** - Leverages Analytics data to test hypotheses and measure impact through feature experimentation
3. **Amplitude Guides and Surveys** - Provides mechanisms to engage users and collect qualitative feedback

Data flows between these products, creating a comprehensive system where:
- User behavior data is collected in Analytics
- This data informs experiment design in Experiment
- Results from experiments can trigger targeted messaging through Guides
- Qualitative feedback from Surveys complements quantitative Analytics data

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Project**: A container for related data, typically corresponding to a single product or application
- **Organization**: A top-level entity that can contain multiple projects
- **API Key**: Public identifier for a specific project, used for client-side implementations
- **Secret Key**: Private authentication credential for secure server-side operations
- **Deployment Key**: Credential used specifically for Experiment feature flag retrieval
- **Management API Key**: Credential for programmatic management of experiments
- **API Token**: Used for accessing Amplitude Data APIs
- **SCIM Key**: For user provisioning integrations
- **Organization-level Keys**: For organization-wide operations

## Authentication and Security Framework

Amplitude implements a multi-tiered authentication system across its product suite:

### Analytics Authentication
- **API Key**: Used for client-side implementations
- **Secret Key**: Used for server-side implementations and sensitive operations

### Experiment Authentication
- **Deployment Keys**: For fetching experiment configurations
- **Management API Key**: For managing experiments programmatically

### Data Authentication
- **API Token**: For accessing Amplitude Data APIs

Authentication credentials can be accessed through the Organization Settings in the Amplitude Analytics web app, with Manager role permissions required to view and manage these credentials.

## API Structure

Amplitude's API architecture is organized into three main categories:

1. **Analytics APIs**: For sending and retrieving analytics data
2. **Experiment APIs**: For managing and evaluating experiments
3. **Guides and Surveys APIs**: For programmatically creating and managing in-product guides and surveys

Each API category has specific endpoints with dedicated authentication requirements, typically using the keys and tokens mentioned in the authentication framework.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude platform is designed as a cohesive ecosystem where:

- Analytics serves as the data foundation for all other products
- Experiment uses Analytics data to measure the impact of feature tests
- Guides and Surveys complement quantitative data with qualitative user feedback
- Authentication mechanisms are shared across products while maintaining appropriate security boundaries
- Data flows between products to enable a comprehensive understanding of user behavior

This integrated approach allows organizations to move from data collection to insight generation to action in a seamless workflow, all within the Amplitude ecosystem.
