# Amplitude Product Suite Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive analytics and experimentation platform designed to help organizations collect, analyze, and act on user behavior data. The platform enables data-driven decision making by providing insights into how users interact with digital products, allowing teams to optimize product experiences.

## Product Relationships and Features

The Amplitude platform consists of several interconnected products:

1. **Amplitude Analytics** - The core product that serves as the foundation for the entire suite. It enables tracking and analyzing user behavior data across digital products.

2. **Amplitude Experiment** - A feature flagging and experimentation platform that leverages Analytics data to test different product variations and measure their impact on user behavior and business metrics.

3. **Guides and Surveys** - Tools for creating in-product guides and collecting user feedback, helping teams understand user sentiment and provide contextual assistance.

4. **Data Management** - Capabilities for managing, processing, and integrating data across the Amplitude ecosystem.

These products share authentication mechanisms but maintain product-specific APIs and credentials. Analytics collects and processes the user behavior data that Experiment uses to measure impact. Guides and Surveys can be triggered based on user behavior tracked in Analytics.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Authentication Credentials
- **API Key**: Public identifier for a project, safe to use in client-side implementations
- **Secret Key**: Private credential for server-side API calls requiring higher security
- **Deployment Keys**: Specific to Amplitude Experiment for feature flag access
- **Management API Key**: Used for administrative operations in Experiment
- **Data API Token**: Used for accessing Amplitude Data APIs
- **SCIM Key**: Used for user provisioning and management
- **Organization-level Keys**: For operations across all projects in an organization

### Security Classifications
- **Public Keys**: Safe for client-side code (API Keys, Deployment Keys)
- **Private Keys**: Must be kept secure for server-side use only (Secret Keys, Management API Keys)

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude ecosystem follows a logical flow:

1. **Data Collection**: Analytics APIs collect user behavior data from various sources
2. **Analysis**: Analytics APIs process this data and provide access to insights
3. **Experimentation**: Experiment APIs enable feature flagging and A/B testing based on collected data
4. **User Engagement**: Guides and Surveys APIs facilitate in-product messaging and feedback collection

All products share organizational settings while maintaining product-specific API keys and access controls.

## API Access and Management

Authentication credentials are accessed through the Organization Settings in the Amplitude Analytics web app. Users need Manager role permissions to access these credentials.

The API structure is organized into distinct collections:
- Analytics APIs
- Experiment APIs
- Guides and Surveys APIs

Each collection contains endpoints specific to its product functionality with appropriate authentication mechanisms.

### Finding Credentials
Navigation path:
1. Log in to Amplitude Analytics
2. Click on the Settings icon
3. Select "Organization Settings"
4. Navigate to the "API Keys" section

## Security Considerations

- API Keys and Deployment Keys can be used in client-side code
- Secret Keys, Management API Keys, and other private credentials should never be exposed in client-side code
- Some keys support rotation for enhanced security
- Access to keys should be restricted based on role permissions within the organization
