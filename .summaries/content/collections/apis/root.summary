## Amplitude API Platform

Amplitude operates a comprehensive API platform spanning Analytics, Experiment, and Guides & Surveys products, unified through a sophisticated multi-tiered authentication system designed for both individual developers and enterprise customers.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

The platform consists of three core product verticals that work in concert:

**Analytics APIs** form the foundational data layer, handling event ingestion, user behavior tracking, and reporting capabilities. These APIs serve as the primary data collection and analysis engine for the entire platform.

**Experiment APIs** build upon the analytics foundation to provide feature flagging and A/B testing functionality. They leverage analytics data to measure experiment performance, calculate statistical significance, and track behavioral changes across user cohorts.

**Guides and Surveys APIs** create user engagement touchpoints through in-app messaging, onboarding flows, and feedback collection mechanisms. These tools generate interaction data that feeds back into the analytics system, creating a closed-loop engagement and measurement cycle.

## Authentication and Credential Management

Amplitude implements a role-based, multi-credential authentication framework accessed through the Organization Settings interface at analytics.amplitude.com:

**API Keys** - Public, client-side credentials for Analytics projects, managed through the Projects interface with rotation capabilities for enhanced security.

**Secret Keys** - Private, server-side credentials requiring Manager role permissions, designed for secure Analytics API operations where credential exposure must be minimized.

**Deployment Keys** - Experiment-specific credentials that operate independently from Analytics credentials, enabling isolated feature flag management and experiment deployment workflows.

**Management API Keys** - Organization-level administrative credentials providing cross-project and cross-product operational capabilities for enterprise management scenarios.

**Data API Tokens** - Specialized credentials for data export and integration operations, offering controlled access to raw analytics datasets for external system integration.

**SCIM Keys** - Enterprise identity management credentials supporting automated user provisioning and directory service integration.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Organization Settings** - Central administrative dashboard accessible via analytics.amplitude.com for credential lifecycle management and organizational configuration.

**Projects Interface** - Project-scoped configuration environment where API credentials are generated, rotated, and managed at the individual project level.

**Role-based Access Control** - Permission hierarchy where Manager roles gate access to sensitive operations like secret key generation and organizational settings.

**Key Rotation** - Security mechanism enabling periodic credential refresh without service interruption, supporting compliance and security best practices.

**Public vs Private Key Classification** - Security taxonomy distinguishing client-safe credentials (public) from server-only credentials (private) based on exposure risk profiles.

## Ecosystem Integration and Scalability

The API architecture demonstrates a data-centric integration model where Analytics APIs serve as the central nervous system, with Experiment and Guides & Surveys APIs functioning as specialized extensions that both consume and contribute data to the core analytics engine.

The authentication system scales from individual developer workflows (project-level credentials) to enterprise deployments (organization-level credentials with SCIM integration), indicating support for diverse customer segments from startups to large enterprises requiring sophisticated identity management and multi-project coordination.

The unified credential management through Organization Settings suggests operational efficiency for customers using multiple Amplitude products, while the specialized credential types (Deployment Keys, Data API Tokens) indicate product-specific optimization for distinct use cases and security requirements.
