# Amplitude API Documentation Suite

Amplitude offers a comprehensive API ecosystem spanning Analytics, Experiment, and Guides & Surveys products, providing developers with robust tools for event tracking, feature flagging, A/B testing, and user engagement across web, mobile, and server environments.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

The API suite is structured around three core product verticals that work together to provide a complete customer analytics and experimentation platform:

**Analytics APIs** serve as the foundation, handling event ingestion, user tracking, and data analysis. These APIs power real-time event collection from client applications and provide server-side access to analytics data and reporting capabilities.

**Experiment APIs** build upon the analytics foundation to deliver feature flagging and A/B testing functionality. These APIs enable dynamic feature rollouts, experiment management, and statistical analysis of test results, with tight integration to analytics event data.

**Guides and Surveys APIs** leverage user analytics data to deliver targeted in-app messaging, user onboarding flows, and feedback collection mechanisms. These APIs coordinate with analytics data to trigger contextual user experiences.

Each product area maintains dedicated API collections with specialized endpoints while sharing common authentication patterns and organizational structures, enabling seamless data flow between analytics tracking, experimentation, and user engagement workflows.

## Authentication and Credential Management Framework

Amplitude implements a sophisticated multi-tiered authentication system with six distinct credential types, each serving specific security and functional requirements:

**Project API Key** - Public identifier for client-side event ingestion in browsers and mobile applications, designed for safe exposure in client code

**Project Secret Key** - Private server-side credential with enhanced security restrictions, used for administrative operations and sensitive data access

**Deployment Key** - Experiment-specific authentication token for retrieving feature flag configurations and experiment assignments

**Management API Key** - Organization-level administrative credential providing access to project management, user administration, and cross-project operations

**Data API Token** - Specialized authentication for data export operations, analytics queries, and reporting functionality

**SCIM Key** - Identity provisioning credential for automated user lifecycle management and directory service integration

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Blueprint** - Template system defining the structure and metadata schema for API documentation pages, enabling consistent documentation generation across product areas

**Collection** - Organizational unit grouping related API endpoints and documentation, with specific collections including `collection:api` (Analytics), `collection:experiment-apis` (Experiment), and `collection:guides_and_surveys_api` (Guides & Surveys)

**Organization Settings** - Administrative interface accessible via analytics.amplitude.com providing centralized credential management and project configuration

**Projects Interface** - Project-scoped configuration area within Organization Settings where API credentials are generated and managed

**Manager Role** - Required permission level for accessing sensitive operations including secret key generation, credential rotation, and administrative functions

**Key Rotation** - Security capability enabling periodic updates of authentication credentials without service interruption

**Public vs Private Keys** - Security classification distinguishing client-safe credentials (public) from server-only credentials (private) based on exposure risk and operational scope

## Ecosystem Integration and Platform Architecture

The API framework integrates deeply with Amplitude's analytics.amplitude.com web platform, creating a unified ecosystem where API credentials, project configuration, and data visualization converge. The Organization Settings interface serves as the central hub for credential management, requiring Manager-level permissions to access sensitive authentication materials.

The documentation infrastructure employs a content management system utilizing blueprints and collections to enable dynamic API endpoint discovery and automated documentation generation. This system supports real-time updates to API specifications and maintains consistency across the multi-product API surface.

Data flows between products through shared organizational and project contexts, enabling analytics events to trigger experiment assignments, which can then activate targeted guides and surveys based on user behavior patterns and experiment cohorts.

## Access Patterns and Security Model

Authentication credential access follows a structured hierarchy:

- **Organization Settings > Projects** interface provides the primary access point for API and secret key management
- **Role-based access control** restricts sensitive credential generation to users with Manager permissions or higher
- **Project-scoped authentication** ensures most API operations are contained within specific project boundaries
- **Organization-level credentials** enable cross-project administrative operations and user management

The security model emphasizes credential separation by use case, with public keys designed for client-side event ingestion where exposure risk is acceptable, while private keys and tokens are restricted to server-side environments for administrative functions, data export, and sensitive operations. This tiered approach enables secure client-side analytics implementation while maintaining strict controls over administrative and data access capabilities.
