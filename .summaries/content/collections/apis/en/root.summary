# Amplitude API Platform Overview

Amplitude provides a comprehensive suite of APIs that enable developers to integrate with and extend the functionality of Amplitude's analytics, experimentation, and engagement products. The API platform is organized into several distinct categories, each serving specific use cases within the Amplitude ecosystem.

## Key Features and Products

The Amplitude API platform consists of three main product areas:

1. **Analytics APIs** - For accessing and managing analytics data
2. **Experiment APIs** - For managing and implementing A/B tests and feature flags
3. **Guides and Surveys APIs** - For creating and managing in-app user guides and surveys

## Authentication and Security

Authentication for Amplitude APIs is handled through various keys and tokens specific to each product:

### Authentication Credentials

- **API Key**: A public identifier for your Amplitude project, used primarily with Analytics
- **Secret Key**: A private credential that should never be exposed in client-side code
- **Deployment Keys**: Used with Experiment for client-side implementations
- **Management API Key**: Used with Experiment for server-side operations
- **Data API Token**: Used for accessing Amplitude Data
- **SCIM Key**: Used for user provisioning and management
- **Organization-level Keys**: Used for organization-wide operations

These credentials can be found in the Organization Settings section of the Amplitude Analytics web app. Users need Manager role permissions to view or generate these credentials. Each project has its own specific keys, and proper security practices should be followed when handling these credentials.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Public Keys**: Credentials that can be safely included in client-side code (e.g., API Key, Deployment Keys)
- **Private Keys**: Credentials that should only be used in secure server environments (e.g., Secret Key, Management API Key)
- **Project-specific Keys**: Credentials that are tied to a specific Amplitude project
- **Organization-level Keys**: Credentials that apply across all projects within an organization

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude API platform is designed to work seamlessly across Amplitude's product suite:

1. **Analytics** forms the foundation, collecting and processing user behavior data
2. **Experiment** leverages this data to run A/B tests and feature flags
3. **Guides and Surveys** uses insights from Analytics and Experiment to deliver targeted in-app experiences

The APIs follow a consistent pattern across products, with each product having its own set of endpoints and authentication mechanisms while maintaining a cohesive developer experience.

## API Structure

Each product category (Analytics, Experiment, Guides and Surveys) contains multiple APIs that serve specific functions. The documentation is organized in tables that list each API with its corresponding description, allowing developers to quickly find the appropriate API for their needs.

The API documentation appears to be dynamically generated, with collection tags like `{{collection:api}}`, `{{collection:experiment-apis}}`, and `{{collection:guides_and_surveys_api}}` used to populate the tables with the available APIs and their summaries.
