# Amplitude Product Suite

Amplitude offers a comprehensive analytics and experimentation platform with several interconnected products. The platform enables organizations to collect, analyze, and act on user behavior data to improve product experiences.

## Key Products and Features

### Amplitude Analytics
The core product that allows tracking and analyzing user behavior data. Analytics provides insights into how users interact with applications and websites, enabling data-driven decision making.

### Amplitude Experiment
A feature experimentation platform that allows teams to test different variations of features and measure their impact on user behavior and business metrics.

### Amplitude Guides and Surveys
Tools for creating in-product guides and collecting user feedback through surveys, helping teams understand user sentiment and provide contextual assistance.

## Authentication and Security

Amplitude uses various keys and tokens for authentication across its product suite:

### Analytics Authentication
- **API Key**: Project-specific public identifier used for client-side implementations
- **Secret Key**: Private key used for server-side implementations that require secure authentication

### Experiment Authentication
- **Deployment Keys**: Used to fetch experiment configurations
- **Management API Key**: Used for managing experiments programmatically

### Data Authentication
- **API Token**: Used for accessing Amplitude Data APIs

### Other Authentication Methods
- **SCIM Key**: Used for user provisioning integrations
- **Organization-level Keys**: Used for organization-wide operations

Authentication credentials can be accessed through the Organization Settings in the Amplitude Analytics web app. Users need Manager role permissions to access these credentials.

## Product Relationships and Ecosystem

The Amplitude platform is designed as an integrated ecosystem where:

1. **Analytics** serves as the foundation, collecting and processing user behavior data
2. **Experiment** leverages this data to test hypotheses and measure impact
3. **Guides and Surveys** provide mechanisms to engage users and collect qualitative feedback

These products work together to create a closed loop of data collection, analysis, experimentation, and user engagement.

## API Structure

Amplitude organizes its APIs into distinct categories:

1. **Analytics APIs**: For sending and retrieving analytics data
2. **Experiment APIs**: For managing and evaluating experiments
3. **Guides and Surveys APIs**: For creating and managing in-product guides and surveys

Each API category has specific endpoints that serve different purposes within the product ecosystem. The documentation provides tables listing the available APIs in each category along with their descriptions.

## Key Nomenclature

- **API Key**: Public identifier for a project, safe to expose in client-side code
- **Secret Key**: Private authentication credential that should never be exposed publicly
- **Deployment Key**: Used to fetch experiment configurations in client applications
- **Management API Key**: Used for programmatic management of experiments
- **API Token**: Authentication token for Data APIs
- **SCIM Key**: Used for automated user provisioning and management

The platform distinguishes between public keys (safe for client-side use) and private keys (for server-side use only), with different security implications and rotation capabilities for each type.
