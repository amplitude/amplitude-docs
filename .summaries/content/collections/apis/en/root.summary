# Amplitude Product Suite

Amplitude offers a comprehensive analytics and experimentation platform with several interconnected products. The platform enables organizations to collect, analyze, and act on user behavior data to improve product experiences.

## Key Products and Features

### 1. Amplitude Analytics
A core product that allows tracking and analyzing user behavior data. Analytics provides insights into how users interact with digital products, enabling data-driven decision making.

### 2. Amplitude Experiment
A feature flagging and experimentation platform that allows teams to test different product variations and measure their impact on user behavior and business metrics.

### 3. Guides and Surveys
Tools for creating in-product guides and collecting user feedback through surveys, helping teams understand user sentiment and provide contextual assistance.

### 4. Data Management
Capabilities for managing, processing, and integrating data across the Amplitude ecosystem.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Amplitude platform is organized as a suite of interconnected products that share authentication mechanisms but have product-specific APIs and credentials:

- **Analytics** forms the foundation, collecting and processing user behavior data
- **Experiment** leverages Analytics data to measure the impact of experiments
- **Guides and Surveys** can be triggered based on user behavior tracked in Analytics
- All products share organizational settings but maintain product-specific API keys and access controls

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Authentication Credentials
- **API Key**: Public identifier for a project, used in client-side implementations
- **Secret Key**: Private credential used for server-side API calls that require higher security
- **Deployment Keys**: Used specifically for Amplitude Experiment to control feature flag access
- **Management API Key**: Used for administrative operations in Experiment
- **Data API Token**: Used for accessing Amplitude Data APIs
- **SCIM Key**: Used for user provisioning and management
- **Organization-level Keys**: Used for operations across all projects in an organization

### Security Classifications
- **Public Keys**: Safe to expose in client-side code (API Keys, Deployment Keys)
- **Private Keys**: Must be kept secure and only used in server-side implementations (Secret Keys, Management API Keys)

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's products are designed to work together within a unified platform:

1. **Data Collection**: Analytics APIs collect user behavior data
2. **Analysis**: Analytics APIs provide access to processed data and insights
3. **Experimentation**: Experiment APIs enable feature flagging and A/B testing
4. **User Engagement**: Guides and Surveys APIs allow for in-product messaging and feedback collection

## API Access and Management

### Finding Authentication Credentials
Authentication credentials can be accessed through the Organization Settings in the Amplitude Analytics web app. Users need Manager role permissions to access these credentials.

Navigation path:
1. Log in to Amplitude Analytics
2. Click on the Settings icon
3. Select "Organization Settings"
4. Navigate to the "API Keys" section

### API Structure
The documentation is organized into distinct API collections:
- Analytics APIs
- Experiment APIs
- Guides and Surveys APIs

Each API collection contains endpoints specific to its product functionality, with appropriate authentication mechanisms.

## Key Security Considerations

- API Keys and Deployment Keys can be used in client-side code
- Secret Keys, Management API Keys, and other private credentials should never be exposed in client-side code
- Some keys support rotation for enhanced security
- Access to keys should be restricted based on role permissions within the organization
