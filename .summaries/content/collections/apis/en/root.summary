# Amplitude Product Suite

Amplitude offers a comprehensive analytics and experimentation platform with several interconnected products. The platform enables organizations to collect, analyze, and act on user behavior data to improve product experiences.

## Key Products and Features

### Amplitude Analytics
The core product that allows tracking and analyzing user behavior data. Analytics provides insights into how users interact with digital products, enabling data-driven decision making.

### Amplitude Experiment
A feature experimentation platform that allows teams to test different product variations and measure their impact on user behavior and business metrics.

### Amplitude Guides and Surveys
Tools for creating in-product guides and collecting user feedback through surveys, helping teams understand user sentiment and provide contextual assistance.

## Authentication and Security

Amplitude uses various keys and tokens for authentication across its product suite:

### Analytics Authentication
- **API Key**: Project-specific public identifier used for client-side implementations
- **Secret Key**: Private key used for server-side implementations and sensitive operations

### Experiment Authentication
- **Deployment Keys**: Used to fetch experiment configurations
- **Management API Key**: Used for managing experiments programmatically

### Data Authentication
- **API Token**: Used for accessing Amplitude Data APIs

### Other Authentication Methods
- **SCIM Key**: For user provisioning integrations
- **Organization-level Keys**: For organization-wide operations

Keys can be accessed through the Organization Settings in the Amplitude Analytics web app. Manager role permissions are required to view and manage authentication credentials.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude platform is designed as an integrated ecosystem where:

1. **Analytics** serves as the foundation, collecting and processing user behavior data
2. **Experiment** leverages this data to test hypotheses and measure impact
3. **Guides and Surveys** provide mechanisms to engage users and collect qualitative feedback

Data flows between these products, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of user behavior and the ability to act on insights through experiments and targeted messaging.

## API Structure

Amplitude organizes its APIs into distinct categories:

1. **Analytics APIs**: For sending and retrieving analytics data
2. **Experiment APIs**: For managing and evaluating experiments
3. **Guides and Surveys APIs**: For programmatically creating and managing in-product guides and surveys

Each API category has specific endpoints with dedicated authentication requirements, typically using the keys and tokens mentioned above.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Project**: A container for related data, typically corresponding to a single product or application
- **Organization**: A top-level entity that can contain multiple projects
- **API Key**: Public identifier for a specific project
- **Secret Key**: Private authentication credential for secure server-side operations
- **Deployment Key**: Credential used specifically for Experiment feature flag retrieval
- **Management API Key**: Credential for programmatic management of experiments

The documentation structure suggests a modular approach to the Amplitude platform, with distinct but interconnected products that share authentication mechanisms and data while serving different aspects of the product analytics and optimization workflow.
