# Amplitude API Platform Overview

Amplitude offers a comprehensive suite of APIs that enable programmatic access to its analytics, experimentation, and user engagement capabilities. The platform provides various APIs organized into distinct categories, each serving specific use cases within the Amplitude ecosystem.

## Key Features and Capabilities

- **Analytics APIs**: Access to user behavior data, metrics, and reporting capabilities
- **Experiment APIs**: Programmatic control over feature flags, A/B tests, and experimentation
- **Guides and Surveys APIs**: Tools for creating and managing in-app user guides and feedback collection
- **Secure Authentication**: Multiple authentication mechanisms using various keys and tokens

## Product Relationships and Structure

The Amplitude API platform is organized into several distinct product areas:

1. **Amplitude Analytics**: The core analytics platform that tracks user behavior and provides insights
2. **Amplitude Experiment**: A feature flagging and experimentation platform for testing variations
3. **Amplitude Guides and Surveys**: Tools for in-app user engagement and feedback collection
4. **Amplitude Data**: APIs for data management and integration

These products are interconnected but have separate authentication mechanisms and API endpoints. The documentation is structured to provide specific guidance for each product area, with dedicated sections for authentication, credential management, and specific API endpoints.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Authentication Credentials

- **API Key**: A public identifier for an Amplitude Analytics project, used in client-side implementations
- **Secret Key**: A private credential for server-side authentication with Analytics APIs
- **Deployment Keys**: Used for Amplitude Experiment, with separate keys for development and production environments
- **Management API Key**: Used for programmatic management of Experiment configurations
- **Data API Token**: Used for authenticating with Amplitude Data APIs
- **SCIM Key**: Used for user provisioning and management
- **Org-level Keys**: Organization-wide authentication credentials

### Public vs. Private Keys

- **Public Keys**: Safe for client-side code (API Key, Experiment Deployment Keys)
- **Private Keys**: Must be kept secure on servers (Secret Key, Management API Key, Data API Token)

### Key Rotation

Some credentials can be rotated (regenerated) for security purposes:
- Rotatable: Secret Key, Management API Key, Data API Token, SCIM Key
- Non-rotatable: API Key, Deployment Keys

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude API platform serves as the programmatic interface to Amplitude's broader product ecosystem:

1. **Analytics** forms the foundation, collecting and processing user behavior data
2. **Experiment** leverages this data for feature flagging and A/B testing
3. **Guides and Surveys** uses insights to target and personalize user engagement
4. **Data** APIs facilitate integration with external systems and data pipelines

All these components work together to provide a complete platform for product analytics, experimentation, and user engagement, accessible both through the web application and programmatically via APIs.

## API Access and Management

To access the APIs:

1. Navigate to the Amplitude web application
2. Go to Settings > Projects to find the API Key and Secret Key for Analytics
3. Different keys are located in their respective product sections
4. Use the appropriate authentication credentials for each API endpoint
5. Follow security best practices by keeping private keys secure and using server-side authentication when appropriate

The documentation provides detailed tables of available API endpoints for each product area, with links to specific API documentation that includes endpoints, parameters, and usage examples.
