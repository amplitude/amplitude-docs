## Amplitude API Documentation Suite

This directory contains comprehensive API documentation for Amplitude's analytics and experimentation platform, covering multiple product areas including Analytics, Experiment, and Guides & Surveys. The documentation provides both high-level overviews and detailed authentication guidance for developers integrating with Amplitude's various services.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Amplitude platform consists of several interconnected products that share common authentication mechanisms while serving distinct use cases:

**Analytics APIs** form the core data collection and analysis foundation, enabling event tracking, user behavior analysis, and reporting capabilities. These APIs work in conjunction with **Experiment APIs** to provide A/B testing and feature flagging functionality, allowing teams to measure the impact of experiments through the analytics infrastructure.

**Guides and Surveys APIs** extend the platform's capabilities into user engagement and feedback collection, integrating with the analytics system to track user interactions with in-app guides and survey responses.

All products share a unified authentication system but utilize different types of credentials based on their specific security requirements and use cases.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**API Keys and Authentication Tokens:**
- **Project API Key**: Public identifier for Analytics projects, safe for client-side use in browsers and mobile applications
- **Project Secret Key**: Private credential for Analytics, requires secure server-side storage and cannot be regenerated
- **Deployment Key**: Used for Experiment product authentication in both client-side and server-side contexts
- **Management API Key**: Organization-level credential for administrative operations across Amplitude products
- **Data API Token**: Specialized token for data export and import operations
- **SCIM Key**: Dedicated credential for user provisioning and identity management

**Access and Permissions:**
- **Manager Role**: Required permission level for accessing and generating API credentials
- **Organization Settings**: Central interface for credential management accessed via analytics.amplitude.com
- **Project-specific Credentials**: Authentication tokens scoped to individual Analytics projects
- **Org-level API Key**: Credentials with organization-wide access permissions

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude platform operates as a unified analytics and experimentation ecosystem where data flows seamlessly between products. Analytics APIs serve as the foundational data layer, capturing user events and behaviors that inform both reporting and experimentation decisions. Experiment APIs leverage this analytics foundation to measure experiment performance and feature adoption rates.

The authentication system is designed with security tiers - public keys for client-side data ingestion, private keys for sensitive server-side operations, and specialized tokens for data management and user provisioning. This tiered approach allows organizations to implement appropriate security measures based on their integration requirements.

The platform integrates with external systems through SCIM for user management and provides data export capabilities through specialized Data API Tokens, enabling integration with data warehouses and business intelligence tools.

## API Access and Implementation

**Authentication Workflow:**
1. Access Organization Settings through analytics.amplitude.com
2. Navigate to API Keys sidebar (requires Manager role permissions)
3. Generate project-specific or organization-level credentials
4. Implement appropriate key types based on client-side vs server-side requirements

**Security Considerations:**
- Secret keys have copying restrictions and cannot be regenerated
- Different credential types are optimized for specific use cases (browser ingestion, mobile apps, server-side operations)
- Role-based access controls limit credential generation to authorized users

The documentation structure suggests a comprehensive API ecosystem with detailed endpoint documentation available through collection-based organization, allowing developers to access specific API references for Analytics, Experiment, and Guides & Surveys functionality.
