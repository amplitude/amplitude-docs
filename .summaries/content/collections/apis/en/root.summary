## Amplitude API Documentation Suite

This directory contains comprehensive API documentation for Amplitude's analytics and experimentation platform, organized into distinct product categories with centralized authentication and credential management.

## Product Overview and Key Features

Amplitude provides a multi-product analytics ecosystem centered around data collection, experimentation, and user engagement tools. The platform offers:

- **Analytics APIs**: Core data collection and analysis capabilities for tracking user behavior and events
- **Experiment APIs**: A/B testing and feature flag management for controlled rollouts and experimentation
- **Guides and Surveys APIs**: User engagement tools for in-app messaging, onboarding flows, and feedback collection
- **Data APIs**: Advanced data access and manipulation capabilities for enterprise use cases
- **SCIM APIs**: Enterprise identity and access management integration

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The documentation reveals a hierarchical product structure where:

1. **Analytics** serves as the foundational data layer, collecting and processing user events
2. **Experiment** builds upon analytics data to enable sophisticated A/B testing and feature management
3. **Guides and Surveys** leverages analytics insights to deliver targeted user experiences
4. **Data APIs** provide programmatic access to the underlying analytics data for advanced use cases
5. **SCIM integration** enables enterprise-grade user provisioning and access control across all products

Each product category maintains its own API collection while sharing common authentication mechanisms and organizational structures.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Authentication Hierarchy:**
- **API Keys**: Public, client-side identifiers for Analytics projects with rotation capabilities
- **Secret Keys**: Private, server-side credentials for secure Analytics API access (Manager role required)
- **Deployment Keys**: Experiment-specific credentials for feature flag and A/B test management
- **Management API Keys**: Organization-level credentials for administrative operations
- **Data API Tokens**: Specialized tokens for advanced data access and manipulation
- **SCIM Keys**: Enterprise provisioning credentials for identity management integration

**Organizational Structure:**
- **Projects**: Individual Analytics implementations with dedicated API credentials
- **Organizations**: Top-level entities containing multiple projects and managing enterprise features
- **Collections**: Grouped API endpoints organized by product functionality

**Security Classifications:**
- **Public Keys**: Client-side safe, suitable for browser and mobile applications
- **Private Keys**: Server-side only, requiring secure storage and handling
- **Rotatable Credentials**: Keys that can be regenerated without service interruption
- **Role-Restricted Access**: Credentials requiring specific organizational permissions

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The API documentation structure suggests Amplitude operates as a comprehensive digital analytics platform where:

- **Analytics** provides the data foundation through event tracking and user behavior analysis
- **Experiment** enables data-driven decision making through controlled testing frameworks  
- **Guides and Surveys** close the feedback loop by enabling direct user engagement based on analytics insights
- **Enterprise features** (SCIM, Management APIs, Data APIs) extend the platform for large-scale organizational deployment

The shared authentication model across products indicates tight integration, allowing organizations to maintain consistent access control while leveraging specialized functionality across the entire Amplitude ecosystem.

## Technical Implementation Details

**Access Patterns:**
- Organization Settings > Projects interface for credential management
- Role-based access control with Manager-level requirements for sensitive operations
- Project-specific vs organization-level credential scoping

**API Organization:**
- Collection-based endpoint grouping using `{{collection:api}}`, `{{collection:experiment-apis}}`, and `{{collection:guides_and_surveys_api}}` template structures
- Summary-filtered documentation with `summary:exists="true"` conditional rendering
- Standardized table format for API endpoint presentation

The documentation architecture supports both developer self-service through clear credential location guidance and enterprise governance through role-based access restrictions and comprehensive key management capabilities.
