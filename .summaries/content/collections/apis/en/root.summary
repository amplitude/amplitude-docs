# Amplitude API Platform Overview

Amplitude provides a comprehensive suite of analytics and experimentation tools accessible through various APIs. The platform is organized around several core products, each with its own set of APIs and authentication mechanisms.

## Key Products and Features

### Amplitude Analytics
A data analytics platform that allows users to track and analyze user behavior. The Analytics APIs enable programmatic access to user event data, metrics, and reporting capabilities.

### Amplitude Experiment
A feature experimentation and management platform that allows for A/B testing and feature flagging. The Experiment APIs provide programmatic access to create, manage, and analyze experiments.

### Amplitude Data
A data management component that likely handles data ingestion, transformation, and storage capabilities.

## Authentication and Security

Amplitude uses a variety of keys and tokens for authentication across its product ecosystem:

### Analytics Authentication
- **API Key**: Public identifier for an Analytics project, used in client-side implementations
- **Secret Key**: Private credential for server-side authentication, should be kept secure

### Experiment Authentication
- **Deployment Keys**: Used to access Experiment features
- **Management API Key**: Used for managing experiments programmatically

### Data Authentication
- **API Token**: Used for authenticating with Data-related APIs

### Other Authentication Methods
- **SCIM Key**: Likely used for user provisioning and identity management
- **Org-level Keys**: Organization-wide authentication credentials

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **API Key**: Public identifier for a project, typically safe to expose in client-side code
- **Secret Key**: Private authentication credential that should never be exposed publicly
- **Deployment Keys**: Credentials specific to deploying experiments
- **Management API Key**: Administrative credential for managing experiment configurations
- **API Token**: Authentication token for accessing specific API endpoints
- **Key Rotation**: The process of replacing authentication credentials for security purposes

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The documentation suggests a well-integrated ecosystem where:

1. **Analytics** forms the core data collection and analysis platform
2. **Experiment** leverages analytics data to run and measure experiments
3. **Data** likely provides the infrastructure for data management across products

Users can access these products through both web interfaces (referenced in finding credentials through the Settings > Projects section) and programmatically through the various APIs.

## API Structure

The APIs are organized by product category:
- Analytics APIs (accessible via an index page)
- Experiment APIs (accessible via an index page)

Each API category contains multiple endpoints with specific functionality, presented in table format with titles, links, and summaries for easy navigation.

## Credential Management

Users can generate and manage API credentials through the Amplitude web application. The platform emphasizes security best practices, including:
- Keeping secret keys private
- Using appropriate keys for client-side vs. server-side implementations
- Managing access control through proper credential usage
- Potentially rotating keys for enhanced security

API credentials can be found in the web application under Settings > Projects > General tab, where both API keys and Secret keys are accessible for authorized users.
