## Amplitude API Documentation Suite

Amplitude provides a comprehensive suite of APIs across multiple product areas including Analytics, Experiment, and Guides & Surveys, with a unified authentication and credential management system.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The API ecosystem is organized into distinct product verticals:

**Analytics APIs** - Core analytics functionality for event tracking, data ingestion, and reporting capabilities. These APIs form the foundation of Amplitude's analytics platform and require project-specific authentication credentials.

**Experiment APIs** - Feature flagging and A/B testing functionality that integrates with the analytics platform to measure experiment performance and user behavior changes.

**Guides and Surveys APIs** - User engagement tools for in-app messaging, user onboarding flows, and feedback collection that complement the analytics and experimentation capabilities.

## Key Authentication Framework

Amplitude employs a multi-tiered authentication system with different credential types for various use cases:

**API Keys** - Public, client-side credentials used for Analytics projects. These are rotatable and project-specific, accessible through Organization Settings > Projects interface.

**Secret Keys** - Private, server-side credentials for secure Analytics API operations. Generation and access require Manager role permissions, providing enhanced security for sensitive operations.

**Deployment Keys** - Experiment-specific credentials for feature flag management and experiment deployment, separate from Analytics credentials.

**Management API Keys** - Organization-level credentials for administrative operations across multiple projects and products.

**Data API Tokens** - Specialized tokens for data export and integration operations, providing controlled access to raw analytics data.

**SCIM Keys** - Enterprise-grade credentials for user provisioning and identity management integration.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Organization Settings** - Central administrative interface accessible via analytics.amplitude.com for credential management
- **Projects Interface** - Project-specific configuration area where API credentials are generated and managed
- **Role-based Access Control** - Permission system where Manager roles are required for sensitive operations like secret key generation
- **Key Rotation** - Security capability allowing periodic refresh of API credentials without service disruption
- **Public vs Private Keys** - Security classification where public keys are suitable for client-side use while private keys require server-side protection

## Broader Ecosystem Integration

The API documentation structure suggests Amplitude operates as an integrated platform where:

1. **Analytics APIs** serve as the data foundation, collecting and processing user behavior events
2. **Experiment APIs** leverage analytics data to measure experiment performance and statistical significance
3. **Guides and Surveys APIs** create touchpoints for user engagement while feeding interaction data back to analytics
4. **Unified Authentication** ensures consistent security across all product areas while maintaining appropriate access controls

The authentication system is designed to support both individual developers (project-level keys) and enterprise customers (organization-level credentials with SCIM integration), indicating scalability across different customer segments and use cases.
