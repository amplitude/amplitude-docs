## Amplitude API Documentation Suite

Amplitude provides a comprehensive suite of APIs across multiple product areas including Analytics, Experiment, and Guides & Surveys, with robust authentication and credential management systems.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The API ecosystem is organized into distinct product verticals:

**Analytics APIs** - Core analytics functionality for event tracking, data ingestion, and reporting
**Experiment APIs** - Feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities  
**Guides and Surveys APIs** - User engagement and feedback collection tools

Each product area maintains its own API collection with dedicated endpoints and authentication mechanisms, while sharing common authentication patterns and organizational structures.

## Key Authentication Framework

Amplitude employs a multi-tiered authentication system with different key types serving specific use cases:

**Project API Key** - Public key for client-side event ingestion in browsers and mobile applications
**Project Secret Key** - Private key for server-side operations with enhanced security restrictions
**Deployment Key** - Experiment-specific authentication for feature flag and experiment data retrieval
**Management API Key** - Organization-level administrative access for project and user management
**Data API Token** - Specialized token for data export and analytics operations
**SCIM Key** - Identity provisioning and user lifecycle management authentication

## Nomenclature and Definitions

**Blueprint** - Content template system used for API documentation structure
**Collection** - Grouped sets of related API endpoints (e.g., `collection:api`, `collection:experiment-apis`, `collection:guides_and_surveys_api`)
**Organization Settings** - Administrative interface accessed via analytics.amplitude.com for credential management
**Projects Interface** - Project-specific configuration area within Organization Settings
**Manager Role** - Required permission level for secret key generation and access
**Key Rotation** - Security capability for updating authentication credentials
**Public vs Private Keys** - Classification system distinguishing client-side (public) from server-side (private) authentication methods

## Broader Ecosystem Integration

The API framework integrates with Amplitude's analytics.amplitude.com platform through the Organization Settings interface, where users with Manager roles can access project-specific credentials. The authentication system supports both client-side ingestion for real-time event tracking and server-side operations for administrative functions and data analysis.

The documentation structure uses a content management system with blueprints and collections, enabling dynamic API endpoint listings and automated documentation generation. Each API category maintains separate collections with summary metadata for organized presentation and discovery.

## Access Patterns

Authentication credentials are accessed through:
- **Organization Settings > Projects** interface for API and secret keys
- Role-based restrictions ensuring only Manager-level users can generate sensitive credentials
- Project-specific scoping for most authentication tokens
- Organization-level access for administrative operations

The system emphasizes security through credential type separation, with public keys for client-side operations and private keys/tokens for server-side and administrative functions.
