## Summary
This documentation describes Amplitude's X Ads integration that imports campaign-level metrics (spend, clicks, impressions) as Daily Ad Metrics events with properties like `ad_metrics.impressions`, `ad_metrics.clicks`, `campaign_id`, and UTM parameters for campaign analysis. The integration performs daily batch imports with configurable data freshness delays (1-3 days) and requires X Ads Manager Admin access, but doesn't provide user-level attribution since X Ads doesn't export user identifiers.
