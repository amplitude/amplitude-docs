# Summary
This documentation page describes the Adobe Analytics integration with Amplitude, which allows importing Adobe Analytics data directly into Amplitude without engineering work. The integration enables deeper analysis of cross-platform customer behavior, provides better visibility into raw data sources, and maps Adobe data fields to Amplitude's schema with specific considerations for event_type, user_id, and device_id.
