# Summary
This documentation details the Adjust integration with Amplitude, which combines attribution data with analytics to track user acquisition sources in real-time. The integration uses Amplitude's Attribution API, requiring advertising IDs (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) for user matching, with attribution events held for up to 72 hours for potential matching before being dropped.
