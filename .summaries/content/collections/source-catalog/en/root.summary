# Amplitude Source Catalog

## Product Overview

Amplitude Source Catalog is a comprehensive collection of integrations that connect Amplitude's analytics platform with various third-party tools, data sources, and marketing platforms. The catalog enables businesses to import data into Amplitude from external sources, export cohorts and analytics data to other platforms, and create bidirectional data flows that enhance the overall analytics ecosystem.

The Source Catalog supports various integration types including:
- Data ingestion from marketing platforms, subscription services, and user engagement tools
- Attribution data from mobile measurement platforms
- Survey and feedback data collection
- Data warehouse and storage integrations
- Cohort exports for targeted marketing campaigns
- Event streaming for real-time analytics

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Source Catalog integrations can be categorized into several functional groups:

1. **Data Import Sources**:
   - Cloud storage platforms (Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage)
   - Data warehouses (BigQuery, Snowflake, Databricks)
   - CDP platforms (mParticle, RudderStack, Segment, Tealium)
   - Reverse ETL tools (Census, Hightouch)

2. **Marketing & Engagement Platforms**:
   - Email marketing (Mailchimp, SendGrid, Braze, Iterable)
   - Mobile measurement platforms (AppsFlyer, Branch, Adjust, Kochava, Singular)
   - Ad platforms (Facebook Ads, Google Ads)
   - Customer engagement (Intercom, MoEngage, OneSignal, CleverTap)

3. **Subscription & Revenue Tools**:
   - Subscription management (RevenueCat, Adapty, Apphud, Nami)
   - Payment processing (Stripe)
   - Monetization platforms (Adapty)

4. **User Experience & Feedback**:
   - Survey platforms (Qualtrics, Survicate, Sprig, Blitzllama)
   - User onboarding (Userflow, Userguiding, Bento, Candu, Chameleon)
   - A/B testing (Optimizely, Split, Taplytics)

5. **Web Analytics & Tag Management**:
   - Google Analytics 4
   - Adobe Analytics
   - Google Tag Manager (client-side, server-side, and legacy)

Most integrations follow one of these patterns:
- **One-way data import**: External platform sends data to Amplitude
- **One-way data export**: Amplitude sends cohorts or data to external platform
- **Bidirectional**: Data flows both ways between Amplitude and the external platform

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **API Key**: Most integrations require an Amplitude API key for authentication and data transmission.

2. **Event**: The fundamental unit of data in Amplitude, representing a user action or occurrence.

3. **User Properties**: Attributes associated with users that persist across sessions.

4. **Event Properties**: Metadata associated with specific events.

5. **Group Properties**: Attributes associated with organizational units (like accounts or companies).

6. **Cohort**: A segment of users defined by specific behaviors or attributes.

7. **User ID/Device ID**: Identifiers used to track individual users across platforms:
   - `user_id`: Typically a unique identifier assigned by the customer
   - `device_id`: A device-specific identifier
   - Many integrations require mapping between their user IDs and Amplitude's

8. **Data Source**: External system from which Amplitude imports data.

9. **Sync Strategies**:
   - **Mirror Sync**: Keeps Amplitude data in sync with source data, including updates and deletions
   - **Append Only Sync**: Only adds new data without updating or deleting existing records
   - **Full Sync**: Replaces all data during each import
   - **Timestamp-based Sync**: Imports data based on time ranges

10. **Webhook**: HTTP callback used by many integrations to send real-time data to Amplitude.

11. **Attribution**: Tracking which marketing channels and campaigns lead to user acquisition.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Source Catalog integrations enable a comprehensive analytics ecosystem by:

1. **Centralizing Data**: Bringing data from multiple sources into Amplitude for unified analysis.

2. **Enriching User Profiles**: Combining behavioral data with demographic, subscription, and engagement data.

3. **Activating Insights**: Sending cohorts and segments to marketing platforms for targeted campaigns.

4. **Closing the Loop**: Tracking the impact of marketing campaigns on user behavior and product metrics.

5. **Supporting Data Governance**: Providing controls for data residency and privacy compliance.

The integrations support various Amplitude features:
- **Amplitude Analytics**: For analyzing user behavior and product metrics
- **Amplitude Experiment**: For A/B testing and feature flagging
- **Amplitude CDP**: For managing user data and cohorts

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

1. **Amplitude HTTP API V2**: Used for sending events to Amplitude
   - Endpoint: `https://api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`
   - EU Data Residency: `https://api.eu.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`

2. **Amplitude Attribution API**: Used by attribution partners
   - Endpoint: `https://api.amplitude.com/api/2/attribution`

3. **Amplitude Identify API**: Used for updating user properties
   - Endpoint: `https://api.amplitude.com/identify`

4. **Cohort API**: Used for exporting cohorts to external platforms
   - Endpoint: `https://amplitude.com/api/2/cohorts`

5. **Webhook Configurations**: Many integrations use webhooks to send data to Amplitude

6. **SDK Implementations**: Some integrations leverage Amplitude's SDKs:
   - Browser SDK
   - Marketing Analytics SDK
   - Mobile SDKs (iOS, Android)

7. **Data Import API**: Used for importing data from warehouses and storage platforms
   - Supports various formats including JSON and CSV

Common implementation patterns include:
- OAuth authentication for user-friendly setup
- API key exchange for server-to-server communication
- Webhook configuration for real-time data streaming
- SQL query configuration for data warehouse integrations
- SDK initialization and event mapping for client-side integrations
