Amplitude's Source Catalog represents a comprehensive ecosystem of data integrations that enables organizations to centralize behavioral analytics by ingesting data from diverse platforms and tools. The catalog encompasses over 60 integrations spanning marketing automation, attribution tracking, customer engagement, subscription management, data warehouses, and experimentation platforms.

## Core Integration Architecture

The source catalog operates on several fundamental integration types that define how data flows into Amplitude:

**Raw-Events Integration** serves as the primary mechanism for ingesting event data directly into Amplitude's analytics platform. This integration type captures user actions, system events, and behavioral data from external platforms, transforming them into Amplitude's event schema for analysis.

**Event-Streaming Integration** enables real-time data synchronization between platforms, allowing for immediate behavioral analysis and response to user actions across multiple touchpoints.

**Cohorts Integration** supports bidirectional data flow, enabling both the import of user segments from external platforms and the export of Amplitude's behavioral cohorts to partner platforms for targeted campaigns and personalization.

**Attribution Integration** leverages Amplitude's Attribution API to capture marketing attribution data, typically with specific requirements for advertising ID matching (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) and attribution windows (commonly 72 hours).

## Data Warehouse and ETL Ecosystem

The catalog includes sophisticated data warehouse integrations supporting enterprise-scale data operations:

**Amazon S3 Import** provides comprehensive file-based ingestion with support for JSON, CSV, and Parquet formats, featuring IAM role authentication, converter configuration, and both Mirror Sync and Append Only import strategies with insert_id deduplication.

**BigQuery Data Import** utilizes Google Cloud Storage bucket offloading with service account permissions (BigQuery Job User, BigQuery Data Viewer, Storage Admin), supporting time-based and full sync import methods with STRUCT data type handling and JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR transformations.

**Snowflake Integration** offers the most advanced data warehouse connectivity with four import strategies (Full Sync, Timestamp, Append Only Sync, Mirror Sync) and Change Data Capture (CDC) capabilities for real-time data mirroring, supporting key pair authentication and S3 Storage Integration.

**Databricks Integration** implements Change Data Feed (CDF) for delta sync operations using all-purpose compute clusters and personal access tokens, with comprehensive troubleshooting for JDBC connection issues and unity catalog permissions.

## Marketing and Attribution Platform Integration

The catalog extensively covers marketing technology stack integration:

**Attribution Platforms** including AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch, Kochava, and Singular utilize Amplitude's Attribution API with specific requirements for advertising ID matching and attribution windows, enabling comprehensive mobile marketing measurement.

**Marketing Automation Platforms** such as Braze, HubSpot, Iterable, Leanplum, MoEngage, and OneSignal support bidirectional data flow, combining campaign event ingestion with cohort export capabilities for closed-loop marketing optimization.

**Advertising Platforms** including Facebook Ads and Google Ads import campaign-level metrics as "Daily Ad Metrics" events with properties like ad_metrics.impressions, ad_metrics.clicks, and UTM parameter mapping for CAC/ROAS calculations.

## Customer Data Platform and Tag Management

**Customer Data Platforms** like Segment, mParticle, Tealium, and RudderStack serve as intermediary layers, supporting both client-side bundled integration and server-side data routing with comprehensive SDK function mappings (track, identify, screen, alias, group).

**Tag Management Systems** including Google Tag Manager provide multiple implementation options: client-side templates using the Browser SDK 2.0 with autocapture capabilities, server-side templates utilizing the HTTP V2 API, and legacy templates with migration pathways to newer implementations.

## Subscription and Revenue Analytics

**Subscription Management Platforms** including RevenueCat, Adapty, Apphud, and Nami enable comprehensive mobile app monetization tracking with subscription event ingestion and revenue analytics, requiring user ID matching between platforms.

**Payment Processing Integration** through Stripe provides webhook-based revenue event import with support for payment_intent.succeeded, charge.succeeded, and invoice.payment_succeeded events, featuring user ID mapping priority and currency normalization.

## Experimentation and Feature Management

**A/B Testing Platforms** such as Optimizely, Split, and Taplytics integrate experiment data through various mechanisms: custom JSON analytics integration for Optimizely with behavioral cohort sync, traffic impression data import for Split with feature flag tracking, and Attribution API integration for Taplytics with experiment variation mapping.

## Customer Engagement and Feedback

**Survey and Feedback Platforms** including Qualtrics, Sprig, Survicate, and Blitzllama capture qualitative feedback data as raw events, enabling correlation analysis between user satisfaction metrics and behavioral patterns.

**Customer Engagement Platforms** like Intercom, Chameleon, Bento, and Userflow track user interaction with support systems, product tours, and onboarding flows, providing comprehensive user journey analytics.

## Authentication and Configuration Patterns

Most integrations follow standardized authentication patterns:
- **API Key Authentication** using Amplitude project API keys
- **OAuth Authentication** for platforms requiring secure token exchange
- **Service Account Authentication** for enterprise data warehouse connections
- **Webhook Configuration** for real-time event streaming

## Regional Data Residency and Compliance

The catalog supports both US and EU data residency requirements, with many integrations offering region-specific endpoints (api.amplitude.com vs api.eu.amplitude.com) and compliance with data privacy regulations through features like advertising ID privacy stripping and user consent management.

## Setup and Maintenance Classifications

Integrations are classified as either partner-maintained (managed by the external platform) or Amplitude-maintained, with setup complexity ranging from simple API key configuration to comprehensive multi-step processes involving service accounts, schema mapping, and data transformation rules.

The source catalog represents Amplitude's comprehensive approach to data integration, enabling organizations to create unified customer data views while maintaining flexibility in their technology stack choices and data architecture decisions.
