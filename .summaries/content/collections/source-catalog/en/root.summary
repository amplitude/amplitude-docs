## Product Overview

Amplitude's Source Catalog provides comprehensive data integration capabilities for importing customer data from various platforms into Amplitude's analytics ecosystem. The catalog supports both marketing automation platforms like HubSpot and enterprise data warehouses like Snowflake, enabling organizations to centralize their customer data for advanced analytics, behavioral tracking, and product-led growth initiatives.

## Product Relationships and Features

The Source Catalog operates as a bidirectional integration hub within Amplitude's ecosystem. For HubSpot integration, it enables both data ingestion from HubSpot's CRM and marketing automation platform, as well as data export capabilities including cohort synchronization and chart embedding. The Snowflake integration focuses primarily on large-scale data ingestion from enterprise data warehouses, supporting multiple synchronization strategies to accommodate different data architecture requirements.

The HubSpot integration leverages Amplitude's core analytics features including Session Replay, Autocapture, and behavioral cohort analysis to enhance marketing workflows. The Snowflake integration utilizes Amplitude's event processing engine to handle high-volume data imports with sophisticated deduplication and transformation capabilities.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Import Strategies**: Four distinct synchronization methods for Snowflake integration:
- **Full Sync**: Complete data refresh on each import cycle
- **Timestamp Sync**: Incremental imports based on timestamp fields
- **Append Only Sync**: Continuous addition of new records without updates
- **Mirror Sync**: Real-time synchronization using Change Data Capture (CDC)

**Product-Qualified Lead (PQL)**: A lead scoring methodology that uses behavioral data from Amplitude to identify prospects based on product usage patterns rather than traditional demographic criteria.

**Cohort Sync**: The process of exporting user segments from Amplitude to external platforms for targeted marketing campaigns and workflow automation.

**Change Data Capture (CDC)**: Real-time data replication technology that captures and propagates data changes from source systems to Amplitude.

**Key Pair Authentication**: RSA-based authentication method for secure Snowflake connections, replacing password-based authentication (deprecated November 2025).

## Ecosystem Integration

The Source Catalog serves as a critical component in Amplitude's broader product ecosystem, connecting external data sources to core analytics capabilities. HubSpot integration enables product-led growth strategies by combining CRM data with behavioral analytics, while Snowflake integration supports enterprise data architecture requirements for organizations with complex data warehousing needs.

The catalog integrates with Amplitude's visualization layer through chart embedding capabilities and leverages the platform's user segmentation engine for cohort-based marketing automation. Data imported through the Source Catalog feeds into Amplitude's event processing pipeline, supporting downstream features like user journey analysis, retention tracking, and conversion optimization.
