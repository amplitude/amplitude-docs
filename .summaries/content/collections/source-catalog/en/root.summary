## Amplitude Source Catalog

Amplitude's Source Catalog represents a comprehensive ecosystem of data integrations that enable organizations to centralize behavioral analytics by importing data from diverse platforms and tools. The catalog encompasses over 70 integrations spanning marketing automation, attribution platforms, customer data platforms, data warehouses, survey tools, and specialized analytics services.

## Integration Architecture and Data Flow

The source catalog operates through multiple integration patterns designed to accommodate different data types and use cases:

**Raw Events Integration**: The primary integration type that imports event data directly into Amplitude's analytics platform, preserving original event structures while enabling cross-platform behavioral analysis. Sources like Adobe Analytics, Google Analytics 4, HubSpot, and Braze utilize this pattern to stream user interactions, campaign events, and engagement metrics.

**Attribution API Integration**: Specialized for mobile attribution platforms including AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch, and Kochava, this integration type handles attribution data with specific requirements for Advertising ID (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) matching and 72-hour attribution windows for accurate marketing performance measurement.

**Cohorts Integration**: Enables bidirectional data flow where behavioral cohorts created in Amplitude can be exported to marketing platforms like Braze, Iterable, and OneSignal for targeted campaign execution, while also supporting cohort-based data imports.

**Event Streaming Integration**: Facilitates real-time data synchronization between platforms, commonly used by customer engagement platforms and marketing automation tools to maintain synchronized user profiles and behavioral triggers.

## Data Warehouse and Cloud Platform Integrations

The catalog includes sophisticated warehouse integrations supporting enterprise-scale data operations:

**BigQuery Integration**: Leverages Google Cloud's BigQuery with specific handling for STRUCT type columns, JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR functions, and RECORD type REPEATED mode data structures. Requires Service Account permissions including BigQuery Job User, BigQuery Data Viewer, and Storage Admin roles.

**Snowflake Integration**: Supports four import strategies (Full Sync, Timestamp, Append Only Sync, Mirror Sync) with Change Data Capture (CDC) capabilities, OBJECT_CONSTRUCT functions for JSON handling, and key pair authentication for secure data transfer.

**Databricks Integration**: Utilizes Databricks Change Data Feed (CDF) for delta sync operations with all-purpose compute clusters, personal access tokens, and Unity Catalog permissions for comprehensive data lake integration.

**Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage**: Enable file-based data ingestion with converter configuration, IAM role setup, and support for JSON/CSV/parquet formats with date prefix organization requirements.

## Marketing and Attribution Ecosystem

The catalog extensively covers marketing technology integrations:

**Advertising Platforms**: Facebook Ads, Google Ads, LinkedIn Ads, TikTok Ads, and X Ads integrations import campaign-level metrics as "Daily Ad Metrics" events with properties like ad_metrics.impressions, ad_metrics.clicks, ad_metrics.cost, campaign_id, and UTM parameters for Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) calculations.

**Attribution Platforms**: Mobile measurement platforms including AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch, Kochava, and Singular provide real-time attribution data through the Attribution API, supporting multi-touch attribution analysis and marketing channel performance optimization.

**Email and Marketing Automation**: HubSpot, Mailchimp, SendGrid, Braze, Iterable, and MoEngage integrations capture email campaign events (sent, delivered, opened, clicked) and marketing automation workflows for comprehensive customer journey analysis.

## Customer Data Platform and Tag Management

**Customer Data Platforms**: Segment, mParticle, Tealium, and RudderStack integrations enable centralized data collection and distribution, supporting both client-side bundled integration and server-side sources with SDK function mappings for track, identify, screen, alias, and group operations.

**Tag Management**: Google Tag Manager integrations support both client-side (Browser SDK 2.0) and server-side (HTTP V2 API) implementations with autocapture events, UTM parameter tracking, and EU data residency options.

**Reverse ETL**: Hightouch and Census integrations enable operational analytics by syncing data warehouse data back to Amplitude for real-time customer experience personalization.

## Specialized Analytics and Feedback Tools

**Survey and Feedback Platforms**: Qualtrics, Sprig, Survicate, and Blitzllama integrations capture qualitative feedback data including CSAT, NPS surveys, and GPT-powered feedback analytics for correlation with quantitative behavioral metrics.

**Product Experience Tools**: Chameleon, Userflow, Userguiding, Bento, and Candu integrations track product tours, onboarding guides, and in-app content experiences for analyzing product adoption and user activation.

**Subscription and Revenue Platforms**: RevenueCat, Adapty, Apphud, Nami, and Stripe integrations handle subscription monetization events, in-app purchase tracking, and revenue analytics for mobile app economy optimization.

## Key Technical Nomenclature

**Integration Types**: raw-events, event-streaming, cohorts, attribution API define data flow patterns and processing methods.

**Authentication Methods**: OAuth, API key, Service Account, personal access tokens, and JWT authentication provide secure platform connections.

**Data Mapping**: user_id, device_id, amplitudeUserId, amplitudeDeviceId, customerUserId enable cross-platform identity resolution and user journey tracking.

**Event Properties**: event_properties, user_properties, group_properties structure behavioral data for analysis and segmentation.

**Sync Strategies**: Full Sync, Mirror Sync, Append Only, Timestamp-based imports accommodate different data freshness and volume requirements.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

The catalog utilizes several core API endpoints:

- **HTTP V2 API**: Primary endpoint for event ingestion with batch upload capabilities
- **Attribution API**: Specialized endpoint for attribution data with real-time processing
- **Lookup Table API**: Enables CSV data import for property enrichment and mapping
- **User Privacy API**: Handles data privacy compliance and user data management

Regional endpoints support data residency requirements with US (api.amplitude.com) and EU (api.eu.amplitude.com) options for GDPR compliance.

## Ecosystem Integration Patterns

The source catalog demonstrates sophisticated integration patterns enabling comprehensive customer analytics:

**Bidirectional Data Flow**: Many integrations support both data import to Amplitude and cohort export back to source platforms, creating closed-loop marketing and product optimization workflows.

**Cross-Platform Identity Resolution**: User ID mapping capabilities across platforms enable unified customer journey analysis despite fragmented touchpoints.

**Real-Time and Batch Processing**: Integration types accommodate both real-time streaming for immediate insights and batch processing for historical analysis and data warehouse synchronization.

The catalog represents Amplitude's position as a central analytics hub in the modern data stack, enabling organizations to unify behavioral data from across their technology ecosystem for comprehensive customer understanding and data-driven decision making.
