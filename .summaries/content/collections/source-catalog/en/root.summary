Amplitude's Source Catalog represents a comprehensive ecosystem of data ingestion integrations that enables organizations to centralize behavioral analytics data from diverse platforms and tools. The catalog encompasses over 60 source integrations spanning marketing automation, attribution platforms, customer data platforms (CDPs), data warehouses, experimentation tools, and specialized analytics services.

## Core Integration Architecture

The source catalog operates on several fundamental integration types that define how data flows into Amplitude:

**Raw-Events Integration** serves as the primary mechanism for ingesting event data directly into Amplitude projects, preserving original event structures and properties. This integration type supports real-time streaming of user actions, system events, and behavioral data from external platforms.

**Event-Streaming Integration** enables bidirectional data flow, allowing platforms to both send events to Amplitude and receive processed data back for enhanced targeting and personalization workflows.

**Cohorts Integration** facilitates the export of Amplitude's behavioral cohorts to external platforms for targeted marketing campaigns, personalization engines, and customer engagement workflows.

**Attribution Integration** leverages Amplitude's Attribution API to ingest marketing attribution data, typically with 72-hour attribution windows and advertising ID (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) matching requirements.

## Data Warehouse and ETL Ecosystem

The catalog includes sophisticated warehouse integrations supporting enterprise-scale data operations:

**Amazon S3 Import** provides comprehensive bucket-based ingestion with IAM role authentication, converter configuration, and support for Mirror Sync versus Append Only strategies. The integration handles JSON/CSV/parquet formats with file size requirements of 1MB-1GB and chronological ordering requirements.

**BigQuery Data Import** utilizes Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket offloading with service account permissions including BigQuery Job User, BigQuery Data Viewer, and Storage Admin roles. The integration supports time-based import methods, full sync operations, and handles STRUCT data types with JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR transformations.

**Snowflake Integration** offers the most sophisticated warehouse connectivity with four distinct import strategies: Full Sync, Timestamp, Append Only Sync, and Mirror Sync. The integration supports Change Data Capture (CDC) functionality, key pair authentication, and handles VARIANT JSON data types with OBJECT_CONSTRUCT functions.

**Databricks Integration** leverages Change Data Feed (CDF) for delta sync operations, requiring all-purpose compute clusters and personal access tokens with Unity Catalog permissions.

## Marketing and Attribution Platform Ecosystem

The catalog extensively covers marketing attribution and campaign analytics:

**Facebook Ads and Google Ads** integrations import campaign-level metrics as "Daily Ad Metrics" events, including ad_metrics.impressions, ad_metrics.clicks, and UTM parameter mapping for CAC/ROAS calculations through batch ingestion processes.

**Attribution Platforms** including AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch, Kochava, and Singular utilize Amplitude's Attribution API for mobile attribution data with specific ADID matching requirements and 72-hour attribution windows.

**Email Marketing Platforms** such as HubSpot, Mailchimp, SendGrid, and Braze provide email campaign event tracking including EMAIL_SENT, EMAIL_DELIVERED, EMAIL_OPEN, and EMAIL_CLICK events with OAuth authentication and hourly sync intervals.

## Customer Data Platform (CDP) Integration

Several CDP integrations enable comprehensive customer data unification:

**Segment Integration** provides bidirectional data flow through the Amplitude (Actions) destination, supporting client-side bundled integration, server-side sources, and SDK function mappings for track, identify, screen, alias, and group operations.

**mParticle, RudderStack, and Tealium** integrations enable cross-platform data aggregation from multiple touchpoints, supporting Android, iOS, Unity, and JavaScript SDKs for comprehensive customer journey tracking.

## Subscription and Revenue Analytics

Specialized integrations focus on subscription monetization and revenue tracking:

**RevenueCat and Adapty** provide mobile app subscription event tracking with behavioral cohort analysis and cross-platform subscription management.

**Stripe Integration** imports revenue events via webhooks, supporting payment_intent.succeeded, charge.succeeded, and invoice.payment_succeeded events with user ID mapping priority and currency normalization.

**Nami Integration** offers no-code paywall analytics for subscription management across mobile apps and connected TV devices.

## Experimentation and Feature Management

The catalog includes sophisticated experimentation platform integrations:

**Optimizely Integration** syncs behavioral cohorts and sends experiment data through custom JSON analytics integration with track_layer_decision functions and campaignId decision objects.

**Split Integration** imports feature flag traffic impression data with get_treatment events, supporting experimentation tracking and cohort targeting for Impact-Driven Development workflows.

**Taplytics Integration** exports mobile A/B testing experiment data using the Attribution API endpoint, sending TL_experiments events with experiment-to-variation mappings.

## User Experience and Feedback Platforms

Multiple integrations capture qualitative user feedback and onboarding analytics:

**Survey Platforms** including Qualtrics, Sprig, Survicate, and Blitzllama provide survey response data ingestion with automatic email-based User_ID mapping and GPT-powered feedback analytics.

**Onboarding Platforms** such as Userflow, Userguiding, Bento, Chameleon, and Candu track product tour events, step completion, and guide engagement metrics for analyzing user activation patterns.

## Technical Implementation Patterns

Common implementation patterns across integrations include:

**Authentication Methods** ranging from simple API key configuration to OAuth flows, service account permissions, and webhook authentication with specific regional endpoint support (US/EU data centers).

**User ID Mapping** requirements ensuring data consistency between platforms, often supporting multiple identifier types including email addresses, device IDs, and custom user identifiers.

**Event Naming Conventions** with platform-specific prefixes (e.g., "[Intercom]", "[Mailchimp]", "[Sendgrid]") to distinguish event sources within Amplitude's unified event stream.

**Data Transformation** capabilities including field mapping, property enrichment, and schema enforcement compatibility for maintaining data quality across diverse source systems.

The Source Catalog represents Amplitude's comprehensive approach to data democratization, enabling organizations to create unified behavioral analytics ecosystems that span the entire customer journey from acquisition through retention and monetization.
