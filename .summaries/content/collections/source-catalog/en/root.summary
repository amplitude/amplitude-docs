Amplitude's Source Catalog represents a comprehensive ecosystem of data integrations that enable organizations to centralize behavioral analytics by importing data from diverse external platforms and services. The catalog encompasses over 80 integrations spanning marketing automation, attribution tracking, customer engagement, subscription management, data warehouses, and experimentation platforms.

## Core Integration Architecture

The source catalog operates through multiple integration patterns designed to accommodate different data flow requirements and technical architectures:

**Raw Events Integration**: The primary integration type that imports external platform events directly into Amplitude as structured events with standardized properties. These integrations typically require API key authentication and user ID mapping between platforms.

**Event Streaming Integration**: Enables real-time bidirectional data flow, allowing both data import from external sources and export of Amplitude behavioral cohorts to partner platforms for targeting and personalization.

**Cohorts Integration**: Facilitates sharing of Amplitude's behavioral segments with external platforms while optionally importing engagement data back to Amplitude.

**Attribution Integration**: Specialized integrations using Amplitude's Attribution API to import mobile attribution data with specific requirements for advertising ID matching (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) and attribution windows.

## Data Warehouse and ETL Ecosystem

The catalog includes sophisticated warehouse integrations supporting enterprise-scale data operations:

**Cloud Data Warehouses**: Snowflake, BigQuery, and Databricks integrations feature Change Data Capture (CDC), multiple sync strategies (Full Sync, Mirror Sync, Append Only, Timestamp-based), and SQL transformation capabilities for complex data mapping.

**Cloud Storage**: Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage integrations support converter configuration, file pattern matching, and automated ingestion with date-prefix organization requirements.

**Reverse ETL Platforms**: Census, Hightouch, and RudderStack integrations enable operational analytics by syncing warehouse data back to Amplitude for real-time customer experience optimization.

## Marketing and Attribution Ecosystem

The catalog provides comprehensive coverage of the marketing technology stack:

**Advertising Platforms**: Facebook Ads, Google Ads, LinkedIn Ads, TikTok Ads, and X Ads integrations import campaign-level metrics as "Daily Ad Metrics" events with properties like `ad_metrics.impressions`, `ad_metrics.clicks`, `ad_metrics.cost`, and UTM parameter mapping for CAC/ROAS calculations.

**Attribution Platforms**: AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch, Kochava, and Singular integrations utilize the Attribution API with 72-hour attribution windows and advertising ID matching requirements.

**Marketing Automation**: HubSpot, Braze, Iterable, Leanplum, MoEngage, and OneSignal integrations support bidirectional data flow for campaign event tracking and behavioral cohort targeting.

## Customer Engagement and Experience Platforms

**Messaging and Communication**: Intercom, SendGrid, Mailchimp integrations track conversational events and email engagement metrics with "[Platform]" event prefixes and webhook-based data delivery.

**User Onboarding and Product Tours**: Chameleon, Userflow, Userguiding, Bento integrations capture step completion, guide engagement, and onboarding funnel events for activation analysis.

**Survey and Feedback**: Qualtrics, Sprig, Survicate, Blitzllama integrations import qualitative feedback data as structured events for satisfaction-based cohort creation and sentiment analysis.

## Subscription and Revenue Analytics

**Subscription Management**: RevenueCat, Adapty, Apphud, Nami integrations track mobile app subscription events, revenue data, and in-app purchase analytics with user ID synchronization requirements.

**Payment Processing**: Stripe integration imports revenue events via webhooks with support for `payment_intent.succeeded`, `charge.succeeded`, and `invoice.payment_succeeded` events.

## Key Technical Nomenclature

**Integration Types**: 
- `raw-events`: Direct event import with property mapping
- `event-streaming`: Bidirectional real-time data flow
- `cohorts`: Behavioral segment sharing
- `attribution`: Mobile attribution data via Attribution API

**Authentication Methods**: API key authentication, OAuth flows, service account permissions, webhook configurations

**User Identity Mapping**: User ID synchronization, device ID mapping, email-based identification, advertising ID matching (IDFA/IDFV/ADID)

**Data Processing**: Insert ID deduplication, JSON property transformation, STRUCT type handling, converter configuration, schema enforcement

**Sync Strategies**: Full Sync, Mirror Sync, Append Only, Timestamp-based imports, Change Data Capture (CDC)

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

The integrations utilize several core Amplitude APIs:
- **HTTP V2 API**: Primary ingestion endpoint for batch event uploads
- **Attribution API**: Specialized endpoint for attribution data with advertising ID matching
- **Batch Event Upload API**: High-volume event processing
- **User Privacy API**: GDPR/privacy compliance integration

Common webhook endpoints follow the pattern:
- US Region: `api.amplitude.com/[partner]`
- EU Region: `api.eu.amplitude.com/[partner]`

## Enterprise and Compliance Features

Enterprise integrations support advanced features including:
- **Regional Data Residency**: US/EU data center selection
- **Schema Enforcement**: Structured data validation
- **User Privacy API Integration**: Automated compliance workflows
- **Account-Level Reporting**: Group-level property mapping for B2B analytics
- **Custom SQL Transformations**: Advanced data manipulation for warehouse sources

The source catalog represents Amplitude's comprehensive approach to data unification, enabling organizations to create a complete behavioral analytics foundation by connecting their entire technology stack through standardized, scalable integration patterns.
