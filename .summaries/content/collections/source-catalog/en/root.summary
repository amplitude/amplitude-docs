Amplitude's Source Catalog represents a comprehensive ecosystem of data integrations that enable organizations to centralize behavioral analytics by importing data from diverse external platforms and services. The catalog encompasses over 80 integrations spanning marketing automation, attribution tracking, customer engagement, subscription management, data warehouses, and experimentation platforms.

## Core Integration Architecture

The source catalog operates through multiple integration patterns designed to accommodate different data flow requirements and technical architectures:

**Raw Events Integration**: The primary integration type that imports external platform events directly into Amplitude as structured event data, maintaining original event properties and user context. This pattern supports platforms like Braze, HubSpot, Intercom, and subscription services like RevenueCat and Adapty.

**Event Streaming Integration**: Enables real-time bidirectional data flow between platforms, commonly used for attribution partners like AppsFlyer, Adjust, and Branch that require immediate data synchronization for marketing attribution and campaign optimization.

**Cohorts Integration**: Facilitates behavioral audience sharing between Amplitude and external platforms, allowing cohorts created in Amplitude to be exported to marketing automation tools like Mailchimp, OneSignal, and Leanplum for targeted campaign execution.

**Attribution API Integration**: Specialized integration pattern for mobile attribution platforms that sends attribution data to Amplitude's dedicated Attribution API endpoint, supporting partners like Singular, Kochava, and Taplytics with specific handling for advertising ID matching and attribution windows.

## Data Warehouse and ETL Ecosystem

The catalog includes sophisticated data warehouse integrations supporting enterprise-scale data operations:

**Cloud Data Warehouses**: Native integrations with Snowflake, BigQuery, and Databricks featuring Change Data Capture (CDC) capabilities, multiple sync strategies (Full Sync, Mirror Sync, Append Only, Timestamp-based), and advanced SQL transformation support for complex data modeling requirements.

**Cloud Storage Platforms**: Direct import capabilities from Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage with configurable file format support (JSON, CSV, Parquet), automated date-based partitioning, and IAM role-based security configurations.

**Reverse ETL Platforms**: Integration with modern data stack tools like Census and Hightouch that enable operational analytics by syncing warehouse data back into Amplitude for real-time customer experience personalization.

## Marketing and Attribution Intelligence

The catalog provides comprehensive coverage of the marketing technology stack:

**Advertising Platforms**: Dedicated integrations for Facebook Ads, Google Ads, LinkedIn Ads, TikTok Ads, and X Ads that import campaign-level metrics as "Daily Ad Metrics" events with standardized properties (ad_metrics.impressions, ad_metrics.clicks, ad_metrics.cost) and UTM parameter mapping for Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) analysis.

**Attribution Partners**: Mobile-first attribution integrations supporting Advertising ID (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) matching with configurable attribution windows (typically 72 hours) and real-time attribution data streaming for marketing performance measurement.

**Customer Engagement Platforms**: Bidirectional integrations with platforms like Braze, Iterable, and MoEngage that support both campaign event ingestion and behavioral cohort export for closed-loop marketing optimization.

## Key Technical Nomenclature

**Integration Types**: Raw-events (direct event import), event-streaming (bidirectional real-time), cohorts (audience export), server-side (backend integration), client-side (frontend SDK integration).

**Authentication Patterns**: OAuth flows for platforms like HubSpot and Intercom, API key authentication for most integrations, service account configurations for cloud platforms, and webhook-based authentication for real-time event streaming.

**User Identity Resolution**: Sophisticated user ID mapping supporting multiple identifier types including email addresses, custom user IDs, device IDs, and platform-specific identifiers with fallback hierarchies for identity resolution across platforms.

**Data Transformation**: Built-in converter configurations for warehouse integrations, JSON property extraction for complex data structures, and automated field mapping between external platform schemas and Amplitude's event specification.

## Specialized Integration Categories

**Subscription and Revenue Analytics**: Dedicated integrations for subscription platforms (RevenueCat, Adapty, Nami, Apphud) that track subscription lifecycle events, revenue attribution, and customer lifetime value metrics with support for cross-platform subscription tracking.

**Product Experience and Onboarding**: Integrations with product tour platforms (Userflow, Userguiding, Chameleon, Bento) that track user onboarding progression, feature adoption, and product engagement for activation funnel analysis.

**Experimentation and Feature Management**: Connections to A/B testing platforms (Optimizely, Split, Taplytics) that import experiment exposure data and feature flag interactions for statistical analysis of product experiments.

**Customer Feedback and Surveys**: Qualitative feedback integrations (Sprig, Survicate, Qualtrics, Blitzllama) that correlate survey responses with behavioral data for comprehensive user experience analysis.

## Enterprise Data Governance

The catalog includes enterprise-grade features for data governance and compliance:

**Regional Data Residency**: Support for EU data residency requirements across multiple integrations with region-specific API endpoints and data processing configurations.

**Privacy and Compliance**: Integration with Amplitude's User Privacy API for data deletion and privacy compliance, with automated handling of user data removal across integrated platforms.

**Schema Enforcement**: Compatibility with Amplitude's Schema enforcement features to ensure data quality and consistency across all imported data sources.

**Monitoring and Observability**: Built-in ingestion job monitoring, error handling, and data quality validation with detailed logging for troubleshooting integration issues.

The Source Catalog represents Amplitude's comprehensive approach to data integration, enabling organizations to create a unified behavioral analytics platform that combines data from across their entire technology stack for holistic customer understanding and data-driven decision making.
