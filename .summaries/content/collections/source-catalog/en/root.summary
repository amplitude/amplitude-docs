Amplitude's Source Catalog represents a comprehensive data integration ecosystem that enables organizations to centralize behavioral analytics by ingesting data from over 60 different platforms and services. The catalog serves as the primary entry point for connecting external data sources to Amplitude's analytics platform, supporting multiple integration patterns including raw events ingestion, cohort synchronization, and bidirectional data flows.

## Core Integration Architecture

The source catalog operates on several fundamental integration types that define how data flows into Amplitude:

**Raw Events Integration** forms the backbone of most source connections, streaming event data directly into Amplitude projects as structured behavioral events. This pattern supports real-time and batch ingestion from platforms ranging from marketing automation tools like HubSpot and Braze to subscription management platforms like RevenueCat and Nami.

**Cohorts Integration** enables bidirectional data sharing, allowing Amplitude behavioral cohorts to be exported to external platforms for targeted campaigns while simultaneously importing segmentation data back into Amplitude. This pattern is particularly prevalent in marketing automation integrations with platforms like Mailchimp, Leanplum, and OneSignal.

**Event Streaming Integration** provides real-time data synchronization for attribution and experimentation platforms, with specialized implementations for mobile measurement platforms (MMPs) like AppsFlyer, Adjust, and Branch that utilize Amplitude's Attribution API for real-time user attribution matching.

## Data Warehouse and Cloud Storage Integrations

The catalog includes sophisticated data warehouse integrations that support enterprise-scale data ingestion through platforms like Snowflake, BigQuery, and Databricks. These integrations feature advanced capabilities including:

**Change Data Capture (CDC)** support through Snowflake streams and Databricks Change Data Feed, enabling delta synchronization for efficient data processing. The Snowflake integration supports four distinct import strategies: Full Sync, Timestamp-based, Append Only Sync, and Mirror Sync, with key pair authentication and S3 storage integration.

**BigQuery Integration** leverages Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket offloading with specific service account permissions (BigQuery Job User, BigQuery Data Viewer, Storage Admin) and supports STRUCT type columns for complex property mapping. The integration handles both time-based and full sync import methods with specific requirements for monotonically increasing timestamps.

**Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage** integrations provide flexible file-based ingestion supporting JSON, CSV, and Parquet formats with converter configurations that map external data schemas to Amplitude's HTTP V2 API specification. These integrations support continuous file discovery with optional event notifications for near-real-time processing.

## Marketing and Attribution Ecosystem

The catalog extensively covers marketing attribution and advertising platforms, creating a unified view of customer acquisition and engagement across channels:

**Advertising Platform Integrations** with Google Ads, Facebook Ads, LinkedIn Ads, TikTok Ads, and X Ads import campaign-level metrics as "Daily Ad Metrics" events with standardized properties like `ad_metrics.impressions`, `ad_metrics.clicks`, and `ad_metrics.cost`. These integrations support UTM parameter mapping for Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) calculations through Amplitude's Ad Performance dashboard.

**Mobile Attribution Platforms** including AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch, and Kochava utilize Amplitude's Attribution API with specific requirements for Advertising ID (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) matching and 72-hour attribution event holding windows for user matching across platforms.

**Tag Management Systems** provide client-side and server-side implementation options through Google Tag Manager templates supporting both the legacy Maintenance JavaScript SDK and the modern Browser SDK 2.0, with comprehensive configuration for autocapture, session tracking, and cross-domain attribution.

## Customer Engagement and Experience Platforms

The catalog encompasses a broad range of customer engagement tools that capture user interaction and feedback data:

**Onboarding and Product Tour Platforms** like Chameleon, Userguiding, Userflow, and Bento stream product adoption events including tour completions, step progress, and guide engagement metrics. These integrations require client-side SDK implementation and user ID matching for behavioral analysis.

**Survey and Feedback Platforms** including Qualtrics, Sprig, Survicate, and Blitzllama import qualitative feedback data as structured events with properties for survey responses, satisfaction scores, and sentiment analysis. The Qualtrics integration supports automatic email-based User_ID mapping and bidirectional cohort sharing.

**Communication Platforms** such as Intercom, SendGrid, and Mailchimp provide conversational and email engagement data with OAuth authentication flows and webhook-based event streaming for comprehensive customer communication analytics.

## Subscription and Revenue Analytics

Revenue-focused integrations enable comprehensive subscription and monetization analytics:

**Subscription Management Platforms** including RevenueCat, Adapty, Apphud, and Nami stream subscription lifecycle events, revenue data, and in-app purchase analytics with specific user ID matching requirements between platforms.

**Payment Processing Integration** through Stripe imports revenue events via webhooks with support for events like `payment_intent.succeeded` and `invoice.payment_succeeded`, including user ID mapping through metadata fields and currency normalization.

## Key Technical Specifications

**Authentication Methods** vary by platform but commonly include OAuth flows, API key authentication, and service account configurations. Enterprise integrations like Salesforce support both daily and hourly sync schedules with schema mapping between external objects and Amplitude group types.

**Data Processing Capabilities** include event deduplication through `insert_id` fields, user property and group property synchronization, and support for complex data transformations through converter configurations and SQL-based mapping.

**Regional Data Residency** is supported across multiple integrations with specific endpoints for US and EU regions, ensuring compliance with data governance requirements.

**Rate Limiting and Quotas** are implemented across integrations with specific batch size limits (1B events for Snowflake), query timeout limits (12 hours), and event volume quotas for marketing automation platforms.

The source catalog represents Amplitude's comprehensive approach to data integration, enabling organizations to create unified customer analytics by connecting disparate data sources through standardized integration patterns while maintaining flexibility for custom implementation requirements and enterprise-scale data processing needs.
