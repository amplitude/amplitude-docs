## Amplitude Source Catalog

Amplitude's Source Catalog represents a comprehensive ecosystem of data integrations that enable organizations to centralize behavioral analytics by ingesting data from diverse platforms and tools. The catalog encompasses over 70 integrations spanning marketing automation, attribution platforms, customer data platforms, data warehouses, survey tools, and specialized analytics services.

## Integration Architecture and Relationships

The source catalog operates through several distinct integration patterns that determine how data flows into Amplitude:

**Raw Events Integration** forms the foundation of most source connections, streaming behavioral events directly into Amplitude's analytics platform. These integrations preserve event-level granularity and enable detailed funnel analysis, cohort creation, and behavioral segmentation.

**Attribution API Integration** specifically handles marketing attribution data from platforms like AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch, and Singular. These integrations focus on mobile attribution with specific requirements for Advertising ID (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) matching and typically maintain 72-hour attribution windows.

**Cohorts Integration** enables bidirectional data flow, allowing Amplitude to export behavioral cohorts to marketing platforms like Braze, Iterable, and OneSignal for targeted campaign execution while simultaneously importing campaign performance data.

**Event-Streaming Integration** provides real-time data synchronization for platforms requiring immediate data availability, commonly used by customer engagement platforms and real-time personalization tools.

**Warehouse Integration** supports enterprise-scale data ingestion from cloud data warehouses including Snowflake, BigQuery, and Databricks, featuring advanced capabilities like Change Data Capture (CDC), Mirror Sync, and Append Only strategies.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Integration Types** define the technical mechanism for data transfer:
- `raw-events`: Direct event ingestion maintaining full event properties
- `event-streaming`: Real-time bidirectional data flow
- `cohorts`: Behavioral segment sharing capabilities
- `attribution`: Marketing attribution data via Attribution API

**Integration Categories** classify sources by business function:
- `marketing-automation`: Email, SMS, and campaign platforms
- `attribution`: Mobile marketing measurement platforms  
- `subscription-management`: Revenue and subscription analytics
- `customer-engagement`: User experience and messaging platforms
- `data-warehouse`: Enterprise data storage and ETL platforms
- `qualitative-feedback`: Survey and feedback collection tools

**User Identity Mapping** represents critical configuration for cross-platform analytics:
- `user_id`: Primary user identifier for cross-platform tracking
- `device_id`: Device-specific identifier for attribution
- `amplitudeUserId`/`amplitudeDeviceId`: Platform-specific ID mapping
- `customerUserId`: External platform user identification

**Data Synchronization Patterns**:
- **Mirror Sync**: Maintains exact replica with INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations
- **Append Only**: Adds new data without modifying existing records
- **Time-based Import**: Incremental updates based on timestamp fields
- **Full Sync**: Complete data refresh on each import cycle

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The source catalog integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem through several key touchpoints:

**Amplitude Data** serves as the central ingestion layer, providing enterprise-grade data governance, schema enforcement, and data quality monitoring across all source integrations.

**Attribution API** functions as a specialized endpoint for marketing attribution data, enabling real-time attribution analysis and campaign performance measurement across mobile advertising platforms.

**Behavioral Cohorts** created from source data can be exported to marketing platforms, creating closed-loop marketing optimization workflows where campaign performance data flows back into Amplitude for analysis.

**Session Replay and Autocapture** complement source integrations by providing additional behavioral context, particularly valuable when combined with survey data from platforms like Sprig, Survicate, and Qualtrics.

**Portfolio and Governance** features enable enterprise organizations to manage source integrations across multiple projects while maintaining data governance standards and access controls.

## Technical Implementation Patterns

**API Authentication** varies by platform:
- OAuth flows for platforms like HubSpot, LinkedIn Ads, and Google Ads
- API key authentication for most direct integrations
- Service account authentication for warehouse integrations
- Webhook-based authentication for real-time platforms

**Data Transformation** capabilities include:
- JSON property extraction using functions like `JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR`
- STRUCT type handling for complex data structures
- UTM parameter mapping for marketing attribution
- Custom field mapping through converter configurations

**Specific API Endpoints and Commands**:
- Attribution API: `/attribution` endpoint for marketing attribution data
- HTTP V2 API: `/2/httpapi` for batch event ingestion
- Lookup Table API: For CSV-based property enrichment
- User Privacy API: For GDPR compliance and data deletion

**Command Line and Configuration Examples**:
- BigQuery: `SELECT JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR(event_properties, '$.property_name')`
- Snowflake: `OBJECT_CONSTRUCT('key', value)` for JSON property construction
- S3/GCS: Date prefix format `YYYY/MM/DD/HH` for file organization
- Databricks: Change Data Feed (CDF) configuration for delta sync

The source catalog represents Amplitude's commitment to providing comprehensive data integration capabilities that support modern analytics workflows, enabling organizations to create unified customer data platforms while maintaining the flexibility to leverage specialized tools across their technology stack.
