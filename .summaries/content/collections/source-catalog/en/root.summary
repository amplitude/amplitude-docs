## Amplitude Source Catalog

Amplitude's Source Catalog represents a comprehensive ecosystem of data integrations that enable organizations to centralize behavioral analytics, marketing attribution, and customer engagement data from diverse platforms into Amplitude's analytics infrastructure. The catalog encompasses over 70 integrations spanning marketing automation, attribution platforms, customer data platforms, data warehouses, and specialized analytics tools.

## Integration Architecture and Relationships

The source catalog operates through multiple integration patterns that define how data flows into Amplitude:

**Raw Events Integration** forms the foundation, ingesting event data directly into Amplitude's event stream with minimal transformation. This pattern supports platforms like Braze, Intercom, HubSpot, and subscription management tools like RevenueCat and Adapty, enabling comprehensive behavioral analysis across customer touchpoints.

**Attribution API Integration** specifically handles marketing attribution data from platforms like AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch, and Kochava. These integrations utilize Amplitude's Attribution API to correlate user acquisition events with downstream behavioral patterns, supporting 72-hour attribution windows and advertising ID matching (IDFA/IDFV/ADID).

**Cohorts Integration** enables bidirectional data flow, allowing Amplitude to export behavioral cohorts to marketing platforms like Braze, Leanplum, and OneSignal for targeted campaign execution, while simultaneously importing campaign performance data back into Amplitude.

**Event-Streaming Integration** provides real-time data synchronization for platforms requiring immediate data availability, supporting use cases like real-time personalization and dynamic user segmentation.

**Warehouse Integration** connects enterprise data infrastructure through platforms like Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, and Amazon S3, supporting multiple sync strategies including Full Sync, Mirror Sync, Append Only Sync, and Change Data Capture (CDC) for comprehensive data warehouse analytics.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Integration Types** define data flow patterns:
- `raw-events`: Direct event ingestion into Amplitude's event stream
- `cohorts`: Bidirectional user segment sharing
- `event-streaming`: Real-time data synchronization
- `attribution`: Marketing attribution data via Attribution API

**Integration Categories** classify source platforms:
- `marketing-automation`: Email, SMS, push notification platforms
- `attribution`: Mobile marketing measurement platforms
- `subscription-management`: In-app purchase and subscription analytics
- `customer-engagement`: User onboarding and product adoption tools
- `data-warehouse`: Enterprise data infrastructure
- `cdp`: Customer Data Platforms
- `experimentation`: A/B testing and feature flag platforms

**Data Mapping Concepts**:
- `user_id` mapping: Synchronization of user identifiers across platforms
- `device_id` mapping: Device-level tracking coordination
- `insert_id`: Event deduplication mechanism
- `amplitudeDeviceId`/`amplitudeUserId`: Platform-specific identifier mapping

**Sync Strategies** for warehouse integrations:
- **Full Sync**: Complete data refresh on each import
- **Mirror Sync**: Maintains exact replica with CDC support
- **Append Only Sync**: Incremental data addition
- **Time-based Import**: Timestamp-driven incremental updates

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The source catalog integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem through several key touchpoints:

**Amplitude Analytics Platform** serves as the central data repository, with sources feeding into core analytics capabilities including behavioral cohorts, funnel analysis, retention tracking, and user journey mapping.

**Amplitude Data** provides enterprise-grade data management, supporting warehouse integrations, lookup tables for data enrichment, and advanced data governance through tools like the User Privacy API.

**Marketing Analytics Suite** leverages advertising platform integrations (Google Ads, Facebook Ads, LinkedIn Ads, TikTok Ads) to provide unified campaign performance analysis through the Ad Performance dashboard, supporting CAC/ROAS calculations and UTM parameter tracking.

**Attribution Analytics** combines mobile measurement platform data with behavioral analytics to provide comprehensive user acquisition analysis, supporting multi-touch attribution and incrementality measurement.

**Customer Engagement Optimization** utilizes bidirectional integrations with platforms like Braze, Iterable, and OneSignal to create closed-loop marketing systems where behavioral insights drive campaign targeting and campaign results inform behavioral analysis.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Attribution API** (`/attribution`) handles marketing attribution data from mobile measurement platforms, supporting real-time attribution event ingestion with advertising ID matching.

**HTTP V2 API** (`/2/httpapi`) serves as the primary endpoint for raw event ingestion, supporting batch uploads and real-time streaming from various source platforms.

**Batch Upload API** handles high-volume data imports from warehouse sources, supporting compressed data formats and bulk event processing.

**Regional Endpoints** support data residency requirements:
- US: `api.amplitude.com`
- EU: `api.eu.amplitude.com`

**Webhook Endpoints** provide platform-specific ingestion paths:
- SendGrid: `/sendgrid`
- Stripe: `/stripe` (webhook configuration)
- Platform-specific endpoints for real-time event streaming

**Authentication Methods**:
- API Key authentication for most integrations
- OAuth flows for platforms like HubSpot, Intercom, and Google services
- Service Account authentication for warehouse integrations
- JWT tokens for enterprise data warehouse connections

The source catalog represents Amplitude's comprehensive approach to data unification, enabling organizations to create a single source of truth for customer behavior analysis while maintaining the flexibility to leverage specialized tools across their technology stack.
