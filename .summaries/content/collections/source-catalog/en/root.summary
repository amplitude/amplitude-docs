# Amplitude Source Catalog

## Product Overview

Amplitude Source Catalog is a comprehensive collection of integrations that connect Amplitude's analytics platform with various third-party tools, services, and data sources. The catalog enables businesses to import data into Amplitude from external sources, export cohorts and analytics from Amplitude to other platforms, and establish bidirectional data flows between Amplitude and partner services.

The Source Catalog serves as a central hub for data integration, allowing users to consolidate user behavior data from multiple touchpoints and platforms into Amplitude for unified analytics. These integrations enable product, marketing, and data teams to create a comprehensive view of the customer journey across different channels and tools.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Integration Types

5. **Subscription & Revenue Integrations**: Track monetization and subscription data
   - Examples: RevenueCat, Stripe, Adapty, Apphud, Nami

6. **Survey & Feedback Integrations**: Import qualitative feedback data
   - Examples: Sprig, Survicate, Qualtrics, Blitzllama

7. **Product Experience Integrations**: Connect product tour and onboarding tools
   - Examples: Userflow, Userguiding, Chameleon, Bento, Candu

8. **Data Warehouse & ETL Integrations**: Connect with data warehouses and ETL tools
   - Examples: Census, Hightouch, Snowflake, BigQuery

### Key Concepts

1. **Bidirectional Data Flow**: Many integrations support two-way data exchange:
   - Importing events from third-party platforms to Amplitude
   - Exporting cohorts from Amplitude to third-party platforms

2. **User Identity Mapping**: Integrations typically require mapping user identifiers between platforms:
   - Common identifiers: user_id, device_id, email, advertising IDs (IDFA/IDFV/ADID)

3. **API Key Authentication**: Most integrations require an Amplitude API key for setup

4. **Data Centers**: Support for different data residency requirements (US and EU)

5. **Import Strategies**:
   - **Mirror Sync**: Reflects the current state of the source data
   - **Append Only Sync**: Adds new data without modifying existing data
   - **Full Sync**: Replaces all data with each import
   - **Time-based Import**: Imports data based on timestamp ranges

The integrations enable Amplitude to serve as a central analytics platform that consolidates data from various sources, allowing businesses to analyze user behavior across multiple touchpoints and platforms.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Event**: A user action or occurrence tracked in Amplitude (e.g., page view, button click, purchase)
2. **User Properties**: Attributes associated with users (e.g., name, email, plan type)
3. **Group Properties**: Attributes associated with groups of users (e.g., company, account)
4. **Cohort**: A group of users who share common characteristics or behaviors
5. **API Key**: Authentication credential used to establish connections between platforms
6. **Attribution**: The process of identifying which marketing channels drive user acquisition
7. **Raw Events**: Unprocessed event data sent to Amplitude
8. **User ID**: Primary identifier for users in Amplitude
9. **Device ID**: Identifier for specific devices in Amplitude
10. **Advertising ID**: Mobile device identifiers (IDFA for iOS, ADID for Android)
11. **Change Data Capture (CDC)**: Technique for tracking changes in data sources
12. **Converter Configuration**: Settings that define how data is transformed when imported

## API Endpoints and Technical Details

While specific API endpoints aren't detailed in the documentation, the integrations typically interact with Amplitude through:

1. **HTTP API V2**: Used for sending events to Amplitude
   - Endpoint: `https://api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`
   - EU Endpoint: `https://api.eu.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`

2. **Attribution API**: Used for attribution integrations
   - Endpoint: `https://api.amplitude.com/api/2/attribution`

3. **Identify API**: Used for updating user properties
   - Endpoint: `https://api2.amplitude.com/identify`

4. **Cohort API**: Used for exporting cohorts to third-party platforms

5. **Lookup Table API**: Used for managing lookup tables

For data import integrations (like Snowflake, BigQuery), the setup typically involves:
1. Creating a service account or authentication credentials
2. Configuring permissions and access
3. Writing SQL queries to extract data
4. Mapping data fields to Amplitude's schema
5. Setting up sync schedules and import strategies

For event streaming integrations, implementation usually requires:
1. API key configuration
2. User identity mapping
3. Event property mapping
4. Setting up webhooks or event triggers
