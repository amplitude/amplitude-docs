Amplitude's Source Catalog represents a comprehensive ecosystem of data integrations that enables businesses to centralize customer data from diverse platforms into Amplitude's analytics infrastructure. The catalog encompasses over 70 integrations spanning attribution platforms, marketing automation tools, data warehouses, customer engagement platforms, and specialized analytics services.

## Core Integration Architecture

The source catalog operates on four primary integration types that define how data flows into Amplitude:

**Raw-Events Integration** forms the foundation, ingesting event data directly into Amplitude's analytics pipeline. This type supports real-time behavioral tracking, user journey analysis, and comprehensive product analytics across platforms like mobile apps, websites, and backend systems.

**Cohorts Integration** enables bidirectional data flow, allowing Amplitude to both receive user segments and export behavioral cohorts to external platforms for targeted campaigns and personalized experiences.

**Event-Streaming Integration** provides real-time data synchronization between platforms, particularly valuable for attribution tracking and immediate behavioral response systems.

**Attribution Integration** specifically handles marketing attribution data through Amplitude's Attribution API, requiring Advertising ID (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) matching and supporting 72-hour attribution windows for user matching across platforms like AppsFlyer, Adjust, and Branch.

## Data Warehouse and Cloud Platform Integrations

Enterprise-grade data warehouse integrations form a critical component, supporting sophisticated data transformation and bulk ingestion capabilities:

**Amazon S3 Import** enables bidirectional sync with configurable Mirror Sync and Append Only strategies, supporting JSON/CSV/parquet formats with IAM role authentication and converter configuration for complex data mapping.

**BigQuery Data Import** leverages Google Cloud's data warehouse through GCS bucket offloading, requiring specific service account permissions (BigQuery Job User, Data Viewer, Storage Admin roles) and supporting both Full Sync and Time-based import strategies with STRUCT type handling.

**Snowflake Integration** provides the most sophisticated data warehouse connectivity, supporting four import strategies (Full Sync, Timestamp, Append Only Sync, Mirror Sync) with Change Data Capture (CDC) capabilities, VARIANT JSON data types, and advanced SQL query transformations.

**Databricks Integration** utilizes Change Data Feed (CDF) for delta sync operations, requiring all-purpose compute clusters and supporting both personal access tokens and service principal authentication.

## Marketing and Attribution Ecosystem

The catalog extensively covers marketing attribution and advertising platforms, creating a unified view of customer acquisition and engagement:

**Advertising Platforms** including Facebook Ads, Google Ads, LinkedIn Ads, TikTok Ads, and X Ads import campaign-level metrics as "Daily Ad Metrics" events with standardized properties like `ad_metrics.impressions`, `ad_metrics.clicks`, and `ad_metrics.cost`, enabling CAC/ROAS calculations and marketing performance analysis.

**Attribution Platforms** such as AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch, Kochava, and Singular utilize Amplitude's Attribution API for real-time mobile attribution tracking, requiring specific Advertising ID matching protocols and supporting attribution event holding for user matching.

**Marketing Automation Platforms** including Braze, HubSpot, Iterable, Leanplum, and SendGrid provide comprehensive customer engagement tracking through email, SMS, push notification, and in-app messaging events, often supporting bidirectional cohort sharing for targeted campaigns.

## Customer Data Platform and Analytics Integrations

The catalog includes major Customer Data Platform (CDP) integrations that serve as data aggregation and distribution hubs:

**Segment Integration** provides comprehensive bidirectional data flow through both Amplitude (Actions) and Classic destinations, supporting client-side bundled integration, server-side implementation, and complete SDK function mappings (track, identify, screen, alias, group).

**mParticle Integration** enables raw event data ingestion from their customer data platform across multiple platforms (Android, iOS, Unity, JavaScript) for consolidated analytics and customer behavior insights.

**Tealium Integration** offers dual integration methods through iQ Tag Management (TIQ) and AudienceStream Universal Data Hub, with Universal Data Object (UDO) configuration and comprehensive data layer management.

## Subscription and Revenue Analytics

Specialized integrations focus on subscription management and revenue tracking, critical for SaaS and mobile app businesses:

**RevenueCat Integration** connects mobile app subscription infrastructure with behavioral analytics, enabling cross-platform subscription tracking and customer lifecycle analysis.

**Stripe Integration** imports revenue events through webhooks, supporting payment_intent.succeeded, invoice.payment_succeeded, and other financial transaction events with user ID mapping and currency normalization.

**Adapty, Apphud, and Nami Integrations** provide specialized subscription monetization tracking, streaming in-app purchase events and subscription lifecycle data for mobile app economy optimization.

## Experimentation and Product Experience Platforms

The catalog includes comprehensive support for experimentation and user experience platforms:

**Optimizely Integration** syncs behavioral cohorts and experiment data through custom JSON analytics integration, supporting both Web Experimentation and Feature Experimentation with campaign and variation tracking.

**Split Integration** imports feature flag traffic impression data with traffic type mapping to Amplitude identities and custom event naming for get_treatment impressions.

**User Onboarding Platforms** including Userflow, Userguiding, Bento, and Chameleon track product tour completion, onboarding funnel progression, and user activation events for product-led growth optimization.

## Survey and Feedback Analytics

Qualitative feedback integrations enable correlation between user satisfaction and behavioral data:

**Survey Platforms** including Qualtrics, Sprig, Survicate, and Blitzllama import survey response data with automatic user ID mapping, enabling satisfaction-based cohort creation and behavioral correlation analysis.

**Customer Support Integration** through Intercom provides conversational relationship platform data with OAuth authentication and comprehensive event streaming across conversation, contact, user, and visitor topics.

## Technical Implementation Patterns

The integrations follow consistent technical patterns for authentication, data mapping, and event processing:

**Authentication Methods** include OAuth flows, API key configuration, service account setup, and webhook authentication, with specific requirements varying by platform complexity and security needs.

**User Identity Mapping** requires careful alignment between platform user identifiers, with common patterns including email-based mapping, custom user ID synchronization, and device ID matching for anonymous user tracking.

**Event Processing** supports real-time streaming, batch ingestion, and scheduled sync operations, with configurable data transformation, property mapping, and event naming conventions to maintain consistency across the analytics ecosystem.

The Source Catalog represents Amplitude's comprehensive approach to data integration, enabling businesses to create unified customer data foundations that support advanced analytics, personalization, and growth optimization across their entire technology stack.
