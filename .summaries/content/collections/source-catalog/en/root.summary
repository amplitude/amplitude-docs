10. **User ID Mapping**: Process of connecting user identities across different platforms (amplitudeId, deviceId, customerId).

## Integration Setup Patterns

Most integrations follow similar setup patterns:

1. **API Key Exchange**: Copying API keys between platforms to establish authentication.

2. **Configuration Settings**: Specifying which events, properties, or data to share.

3. **User Identity Mapping**: Configuring how user IDs are matched between systems.

4. **Data Transformation**: Setting up property mapping or data conversion rules.

5. **Testing and Validation**: Verifying data is flowing correctly between systems.
