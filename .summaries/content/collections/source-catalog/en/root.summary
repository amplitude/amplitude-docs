## Amplitude Source Catalog

Amplitude's Source Catalog represents a comprehensive ecosystem of data integrations that enable organizations to centralize behavioral analytics by ingesting data from diverse platforms and tools. The catalog encompasses over 60 source integrations spanning marketing automation, attribution platforms, customer data platforms, data warehouses, survey tools, and specialized analytics services.

## Integration Architecture and Data Flow

The source catalog operates through multiple integration patterns designed to accommodate different data types and use cases:

**Raw Events Integration**: The primary integration type that streams event data directly into Amplitude's analytics platform, preserving granular user interactions and behavioral data. Sources like Adobe Analytics, Braze, HubSpot, and mobile attribution platforms use this pattern to send timestamped events with associated properties.

**Event Streaming Integration**: Enables real-time bidirectional data flow between platforms, commonly used by marketing automation tools like Iterable, MoEngage, and customer engagement platforms to synchronize user actions and campaign responses.

**Cohorts Integration**: Supports behavioral audience sharing where Amplitude's user segments can be exported to destination platforms while simultaneously importing segmentation data from external sources. This bidirectional capability is utilized by platforms like Braze, OneSignal, and Segment.

**Attribution Integration**: Specialized for mobile marketing attribution using Amplitude's Attribution API, enabling platforms like Adjust, AppsFlyer, Branch, and Singular to send attribution data with 72-hour retention windows and advertising ID matching (IDFA/IDFV/ADID).

## Data Warehouse and ETL Integrations

The catalog includes robust support for enterprise data infrastructure through warehouse-native integrations:

**Cloud Data Warehouses**: Direct integrations with Snowflake, BigQuery, and Databricks support multiple sync strategies including Full Sync, Timestamp-based imports, Append Only Sync, and Mirror Sync with Change Data Capture (CDC) functionality. These integrations handle complex data transformations using SQL functions like `OBJECT_CONSTRUCT` for Snowflake and `JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR` for BigQuery.

**Cloud Storage Platforms**: Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage integrations enable batch data ingestion with converter configurations, supporting JSON, CSV, and Parquet formats with specific organizational requirements like date prefix formatting (YYYY/MM/DD/HH).

**Reverse ETL Platforms**: Census and Hightouch integrations enable operational analytics by syncing warehouse data back to Amplitude, supporting the modern data stack architecture where warehouses serve as the single source of truth.

## Marketing and Attribution Ecosystem

The catalog extensively covers the mobile marketing and attribution landscape:

**Mobile Measurement Platforms (MMPs)**: Integrations with AppsFlyer, Adjust, Kochava, Airbridge, and Singular provide comprehensive attribution tracking with specific handling for Self-Reporting Networks (SRNs), advertising ID privacy considerations, and multi-touch attribution analysis.

**Advertising Platforms**: Google Ads and Facebook Ads integrations import campaign-level metrics as "Daily Ad Metrics" events, including spend, impressions, and click data with UTM parameter mapping for CAC/ROAS calculations and performance analysis.

**Marketing Automation**: Platforms like Braze, Iterable, HubSpot, Mailchimp, and SendGrid provide email campaign tracking, customer journey analytics, and cross-channel engagement measurement through webhook-based event streaming.

## Subscription and Revenue Analytics

Specialized integrations support subscription business models and revenue tracking:

**Subscription Platforms**: RevenueCat, Adapty, Apphud, and Nami integrations stream in-app purchase events, subscription lifecycle data, and monetization metrics for mobile app revenue analysis.

**Payment Processing**: Stripe integration imports revenue events through webhooks, supporting payment_intent.succeeded, charge.succeeded, and invoice.payment_succeeded events with currency normalization and user ID mapping.

## User Experience and Product Analytics

The catalog includes tools for understanding user experience and product adoption:

**Onboarding and Product Tours**: Userflow, Userguiding, Chameleon, Candu, and Bento integrations track user onboarding progress, product tour completion, and feature adoption through step-by-step analytics.

**Survey and Feedback Platforms**: Qualtrics, Sprig, Survicate, and Blitzllama integrations import qualitative feedback data, NPS scores, CSAT responses, and GPT-powered sentiment analysis for comprehensive user experience measurement.

**Experimentation Platforms**: Split, Optimizely, and Taplytics integrations provide feature flag impression data, A/B test results, and experiment variation tracking for data-driven product development.

## Technical Implementation Patterns

**Authentication Methods**: The catalog supports multiple authentication patterns including OAuth flows (HubSpot, Intercom), API key authentication (most integrations), service account configurations (Google Cloud services), and JWT token authentication (Snowflake).

**User Identity Mapping**: Critical for cross-platform analytics, integrations support various identity resolution methods including user_id matching, email-based mapping, device_id synchronization, and custom identifier fields like amplitudeDeviceId and customerUserId.

**Data Transformation**: Many integrations include built-in data transformation capabilities, such as event property mapping, user property enrichment, UTM parameter extraction, and custom field transformations to ensure data consistency across platforms.

**Regional Compliance**: Multiple integrations support EU data residency requirements with region-specific endpoints and data center selection options for GDPR compliance.

## Enterprise and Specialized Integrations

**Customer Data Platforms**: Segment, mParticle, Tealium, RudderStack, and MetaRouter integrations enable comprehensive customer data orchestration with support for multiple SDK implementations and server-side data processing.

**CRM and Sales Platforms**: Salesforce Group V2 integration imports account-level data as group properties with configurable sync cadences and schema mapping between Salesforce objects and Amplitude group types.

**Tag Management**: Google Tag Manager integrations support both client-side and server-side implementations with the latest Browser SDK 2.0, including autocapture capabilities, session tracking, and marketing attribution.

The Amplitude Source Catalog represents a mature ecosystem designed to support modern data-driven organizations by providing comprehensive, reliable, and scalable integrations across the entire customer data landscape, enabling unified behavioral analytics and actionable insights from diverse data sources.
