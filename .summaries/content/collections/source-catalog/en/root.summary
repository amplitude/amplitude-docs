## Amplitude Source Catalog

Amplitude's Source Catalog represents a comprehensive ecosystem of data integrations that enable businesses to centralize customer behavior analytics from diverse platforms and tools. The catalog encompasses over 60 integrations spanning attribution platforms, marketing automation tools, data warehouses, customer engagement platforms, and specialized analytics services.

## Integration Architecture and Data Flow

The source catalog operates through multiple integration patterns designed to accommodate different data types and use cases:

**Raw Events Integration**: The primary integration type that streams event data directly into Amplitude projects, preserving granular user interactions and behavioral data. This includes platforms like Adapty, Airbridge, Braze, and Google Analytics 4.

**Cohorts Integration**: Enables bidirectional data flow where Amplitude behavioral cohorts can be exported to external platforms for targeted campaigns, while also importing segmentation data. Examples include Braze, OneSignal, and Segment.

**Attribution API Integration**: Specialized for mobile attribution data, requiring Advertising ID (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) matching with 72-hour attribution windows. Key platforms include Adjust, AppsFlyer, and Branch.

**Event Streaming**: Real-time data transmission for immediate analytics processing, commonly used by customer engagement platforms and marketing automation tools.

## Key Integration Categories

**Marketing and Attribution Platforms**: Facebook Ads, Google Ads, LinkedIn Ads, TikTok Ads, and X Ads import campaign-level metrics as "Daily Ad Metrics" events with properties like `ad_metrics.impressions`, `ad_metrics.clicks`, and `ad_metrics.cost` for CAC/ROAS calculations.

**Data Warehouses and ETL**: Amazon S3, BigQuery, Databricks, and Snowflake integrations support sophisticated data import strategies including Full Sync, Mirror Sync, Append Only, and Change Data Capture (CDC) with SQL transformation capabilities.

**Customer Engagement and Marketing Automation**: Platforms like Braze, Intercom, Mailchimp, and SendGrid stream customer interaction events while supporting cohort-based targeting through bidirectional data flow.

**Subscription and Revenue Analytics**: Specialized integrations with Adapty, RevenueCat, Stripe, and Nami focus on subscription management events, in-app purchase tracking, and revenue analytics.

**Survey and Feedback Platforms**: Qualtrics, Sprig, and Survicate import qualitative feedback data as raw events, enabling correlation analysis between user satisfaction and product behavior.

## Technical Implementation Patterns

**Authentication Methods**: Integrations utilize various authentication approaches including OAuth (HubSpot, LinkedIn Ads), API keys (most platforms), service accounts (Google Cloud services), and webhook configurations (Stripe, SendGrid).

**User Identity Mapping**: Critical for data correlation across platforms, supporting multiple identifier types including `user_id`, `device_id`, email addresses, and platform-specific identifiers like `amplitudeUserId` and `customerUserId`.

**Data Transformation and Enrichment**: Advanced integrations support SQL transformations (BigQuery, Snowflake), converter configurations (S3, GCS), and field mapping for event properties, user properties, and group properties.

## Enterprise Data Warehouse Integrations

The catalog includes sophisticated warehouse integrations with specific technical requirements:

**BigQuery Integration**: Requires GCS bucket configuration, Service Account permissions (BigQuery Job User, Storage Admin), and supports both daily and streaming table exports with STRUCT type handling and JSON property extraction.

**Snowflake Integration**: Features Change Data Capture capabilities, multiple import strategies, key pair authentication, and specific SQL query requirements including `OBJECT_CONSTRUCT` functions and `EPOCH_MILLISECOND` extraction.

**Databricks Integration**: Utilizes Change Data Feed (CDF) for delta sync operations, requires all-purpose compute clusters, and supports personal access tokens with Unity Catalog permissions.

## Specialized Integration Features

**Google Tag Manager Templates**: Multiple implementations including client-side Browser SDK 2.0 template, server-side HTTP V2 API template, and legacy template migration paths with breaking changes documentation.

**Attribution Window Management**: Mobile attribution platforms implement 72-hour attribution event holding for user matching, with specific requirements for Advertising ID configuration across Android and iOS SDKs.

**Revenue Event Processing**: Stripe integration supports comprehensive revenue event types including `payment_intent.succeeded`, `invoice.payment_succeeded`, and `checkout.session.completed` with currency normalization and user ID mapping priority.

## API Endpoints and Technical Specifications

Key API endpoints include:
- `api.amplitude.com/sendgrid` and `api.eu.amplitude.com/sendgrid` for SendGrid integration
- Attribution API endpoints for mobile attribution platforms
- HTTP V2 API for server-side integrations and warehouse imports
- Lookup Table API for CSV data import and property enrichment

The catalog supports various data formats including JSON, CSV, and Parquet files with specific size requirements (1MB-5GB) and chronological upload ordering for warehouse integrations.

## Integration Management and Monitoring

Most integrations provide monitoring capabilities through Ingestion Jobs tracking, event volume quotas, and data validation features. Partner-maintained integrations are clearly identified, with setup often handled through external platform dashboards and configuration interfaces.

The source catalog represents Amplitude's comprehensive approach to data centralization, enabling businesses to create unified customer analytics by connecting disparate data sources through standardized integration patterns while maintaining data quality and real-time processing capabilities.
