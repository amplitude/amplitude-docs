## Amplitude Source Catalog

Amplitude's Source Catalog represents a comprehensive ecosystem of data integrations that enable businesses to centralize customer behavior analytics from diverse platforms and tools. The catalog encompasses over 70 integrations spanning attribution platforms, marketing automation tools, data warehouses, customer engagement platforms, and specialized analytics services.

## Integration Architecture and Data Flow

The source catalog operates through multiple integration patterns designed to accommodate different data types and use cases:

**Raw Events Integration**: The primary integration type that streams event data directly into Amplitude projects, preserving granular user interactions and behavioral data. This includes platforms like Adapty, Airbridge, Braze, and Google Analytics 4.

**Cohorts Integration**: Enables bidirectional data flow where Amplitude behavioral cohorts can be exported to external platforms for targeted campaigns, while also importing segmentation data. Examples include Braze, OneSignal, and Segment.

**Attribution API Integration**: Specialized for mobile attribution data, requiring Advertising ID (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) matching with 72-hour attribution windows. Key platforms include Adjust, AppsFlyer, Branch, and Kochava.

**Server-Side vs Client-Side**: Integrations operate through various connection methods, from server-side API connections (HubSpot, Salesforce) to client-side SDK implementations (Google Tag Manager, Chameleon).

## Data Warehouse and ETL Ecosystem

The catalog features robust support for major data warehouse platforms through sophisticated import mechanisms:

**Cloud Data Warehouses**: BigQuery, Snowflake, and Databricks integrations support Change Data Capture (CDC), Mirror Sync, Append Only Sync, and Full Sync strategies. These require specific permissions like BigQuery Job User roles, Storage Admin permissions, and service account configurations.

**Cloud Storage**: Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage integrations enable file-based imports with converter configurations, supporting JSON/CSV/parquet formats with specific folder structures (YYYY/MM/DD/HH) and 48-hour search windows.

**Reverse ETL**: Platforms like Census, Hightouch, and RudderStack enable syncing processed warehouse data back to Amplitude, creating closed-loop analytics workflows.

## Marketing and Attribution Ecosystem

The catalog extensively supports marketing analytics through specialized ad platform integrations:

**Ad Networks**: Facebook Ads, Google Ads, LinkedIn Ads, TikTok Ads, and X Ads import campaign-level metrics as "Daily Ad Metrics" events with properties like `ad_metrics.impressions`, `ad_metrics.clicks`, `ad_metrics.cost`, and UTM parameters for CAC/ROAS calculations.

**Attribution Platforms**: Mobile measurement platforms (MMPs) like Adjust, AppsFlyer, Kochava, and Singular provide attribution data through the Attribution API, enabling marketing channel performance analysis.

**Email Marketing**: SendGrid, Mailchimp, and HubSpot integrations track email engagement metrics (opens, clicks, conversions) with user ID mapping through unique parameters.

## Customer Engagement and Experience Platforms

The catalog includes comprehensive support for customer engagement tools:

**Messaging Platforms**: Braze, OneSignal, Intercom, and Insider provide bidirectional integration for campaign event tracking and cohort-based targeting across push notifications, email, SMS, and in-app messaging.

**Survey and Feedback**: Qualtrics, Sprig, Survicate, and Blitzllama enable qualitative feedback analysis by importing survey responses as raw events with satisfaction scoring and sentiment analysis.

**Onboarding and Product Tours**: Userflow, Userguiding, Bento, and Chameleon track user onboarding journeys, product tour completions, and feature adoption metrics.

## Subscription and Revenue Analytics

Specialized integrations support subscription business models:

**Subscription Platforms**: RevenueCat, Adapty, Apphud, and Nami provide subscription event tracking, revenue analytics, and paywall performance metrics for mobile app monetization.

**Payment Processing**: Stripe integration imports revenue events through webhooks, including `payment_intent.succeeded`, `invoice.payment_succeeded`, and other financial transaction events.

## Key Technical Specifications

**Authentication Methods**: OAuth (HubSpot, LinkedIn Ads), API keys (most integrations), service accounts (cloud platforms), and webhook configurations (Stripe, SendGrid).

**Data Mapping**: User ID synchronization through various identifiers (email, device_id, custom user IDs), with specific mapping requirements for cross-platform user tracking.

**Event Processing**: Support for insert_id deduplication, event property enrichment, user property mapping, and group property associations for account-level reporting.

**Regional Compliance**: EU data residency support across multiple integrations, with region-specific endpoints (api.eu.amplitude.com) for GDPR compliance.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

Key API endpoints include:
- `api.amplitude.com/sendgrid` for SendGrid webhook integration
- `api.amplitude.com/iterable` for Iterable campaign metrics
- Attribution API for mobile attribution data
- HTTP V2 API for server-side Google Tag Manager integration

The catalog supports various SDK implementations including JavaScript, iOS, Android, React Native, and Unity, with specific configuration requirements for cross-domain tracking, session management, and user identification across platforms.

This comprehensive integration ecosystem positions Amplitude as a central hub for customer behavior analytics, enabling businesses to unify data from across their entire technology stack for holistic user journey analysis and data-driven decision making.
