Amplitude's Source Catalog represents a comprehensive ecosystem of data integrations that enables businesses to centralize customer data from diverse platforms into Amplitude's analytics infrastructure. The catalog encompasses over 70 integrations spanning attribution platforms, marketing automation tools, data warehouses, customer engagement platforms, and specialized analytics services.

## Core Integration Architecture

The source catalog operates on four primary integration types that define how data flows into Amplitude:

**Raw-Events Integration** forms the foundation, ingesting event data directly into Amplitude's analytics pipeline. This type supports real-time behavioral tracking, user journey analysis, and comprehensive product analytics across platforms like mobile apps, websites, and backend systems.

**Cohorts Integration** enables bidirectional data flow, allowing Amplitude to both receive user segments and export behavioral cohorts to external platforms for targeted campaigns and personalized experiences.

**Event-Streaming Integration** provides real-time data synchronization for platforms requiring immediate data availability, particularly useful for marketing automation and customer engagement tools.

**Attribution Integration** leverages Amplitude's Attribution API to process marketing attribution data, typically requiring Advertising ID (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) matching with 72-hour attribution windows for user matching across platforms.

## Data Warehouse and Cloud Platform Integrations

Enterprise-grade data warehouse integrations form a critical component, supporting **Amazon S3**, **BigQuery**, **Snowflake**, **Databricks**, and **Google Cloud Storage**. These integrations feature sophisticated data synchronization strategies:

**Mirror Sync** maintains real-time data consistency between warehouse and Amplitude, supporting INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations through Change Data Capture (CDC) mechanisms.

**Append Only Sync** provides incremental data loading for event streams, optimizing for high-volume data ingestion scenarios.

**Time-based Import** enables scheduled data synchronization using monotonically increasing timestamp columns for efficient delta processing.

Configuration requires specific IAM roles, service account permissions, and converter configurations that map warehouse schemas to Amplitude's HTTP V2 API specification, handling complex data types like STRUCT and RECORD formats through SQL transformations.

## Marketing and Attribution Platform Ecosystem

The catalog extensively covers marketing attribution platforms including **AppsFlyer**, **Adjust**, **Branch**, **Kochava**, and **Singular**, all utilizing Amplitude's Attribution API for mobile marketing measurement. These integrations require precise Advertising ID matching and support attribution event holding for delayed user matching scenarios.

Advertising platform integrations for **Facebook Ads**, **Google Ads**, **LinkedIn Ads**, **TikTok Ads**, and **X Ads** import campaign-level metrics as "Daily Ad Metrics" events, featuring properties like `ad_metrics.impressions`, `ad_metrics.clicks`, and `ad_metrics.cost` for Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) calculations. These integrations require UTM parameter configuration and support synthetic user identifiers for campaign-level analysis.

## Customer Engagement and Marketing Automation

Marketing automation platforms including **Braze**, **Iterable**, **Leanplum**, **MoEngage**, and **OneSignal** support bidirectional data flow, enabling both event ingestion and cohort export for personalized messaging campaigns across email, SMS, push notifications, and in-app channels.

Email marketing integrations with **SendGrid**, **Mailchimp**, and **HubSpot** track engagement metrics through webhook configurations, mapping email events to user behaviors for comprehensive customer journey analysis.

## Subscription and Revenue Analytics

Subscription management platforms **RevenueCat**, **Adapty**, **Apphud**, and **Nami** specialize in mobile app monetization, streaming subscription events, revenue data, and in-app purchase analytics. These integrations require user ID matching between platforms and support real-time revenue tracking for subscription optimization.

**Stripe** integration imports revenue events through webhook configuration, supporting payment_intent.succeeded, invoice.payment_succeeded, and other financial transaction events with currency normalization and user ID mapping priority systems.

## Product Experience and User Onboarding

User onboarding and product experience platforms including **Userflow**, **Userguiding**, **Chameleon**, **Bento**, and **Candu** track in-app guidance events, product tour completions, and onboarding funnel progression. These integrations enable analysis of feature adoption, user activation patterns, and onboarding effectiveness through event streaming of step completions and guide interactions.

## Survey and Feedback Analytics

Qualitative feedback platforms **Qualtrics**, **Sprig**, **Survicate**, and **Blitzllama** integrate survey response data with behavioral analytics, enabling correlation analysis between user satisfaction metrics (CSAT, NPS) and product usage patterns. These integrations support automatic email-based user ID mapping and bidirectional cohort sharing for targeted survey distribution.

## Customer Data Platforms and Reverse ETL

Customer Data Platform integrations with **Segment**, **mParticle**, **Tealium**, **RudderStack**, **Hightouch**, and **Census** enable comprehensive data orchestration. **Segment** provides bidirectional integration through the Amplitude (Actions) destination, supporting client-side bundled integration and server-side implementation with SDK function mappings for track, identify, screen, alias, and group operations.

Reverse ETL platforms **Hightouch** and **Census** sync data warehouse data into Amplitude as raw events, enabling real-time customer experience personalization through warehouse-to-Amplitude pipelines.

## Experimentation and Feature Management

Experimentation platforms **Optimizely**, **Split**, and **Taplytics** integrate A/B testing and feature flag data, sending experiment variations, traffic impressions, and feature flag events. **Split** maps traffic types to Amplitude identities (user_id/device_id) while **Optimizely** uses custom JSON analytics integration for behavioral cohort synchronization.

## Key Technical Implementation Patterns

**API Key Authentication** serves as the primary authentication method across most integrations, requiring Amplitude project API keys configured in source platforms.

**User ID Mapping** ensures data correlation between platforms, supporting various identifier types including email addresses, custom user IDs, device IDs, and platform-specific identifiers like `amplitudeUserId` and `amplitudeDeviceId`.

**Event Property Mapping** transforms source platform data structures into Amplitude's event schema, handling complex nested properties through JSON extraction and field mapping configurations.

**Regional Data Residency** support enables EU data compliance through region-specific API endpoints (api.eu.amplitude.com) for platforms requiring data localization.

The source catalog represents Amplitude's comprehensive approach to data integration, enabling businesses to create unified customer data foundations that support advanced analytics, personalization, and growth optimization across their entire technology stack.
