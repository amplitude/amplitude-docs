Amplitude's Source Catalog represents a comprehensive ecosystem of data integrations that enables businesses to centralize customer data from diverse platforms into Amplitude's analytics infrastructure. The catalog encompasses over 70 integrations spanning attribution platforms, marketing automation tools, data warehouses, customer engagement platforms, and specialized analytics services.

## Core Integration Architecture

The source catalog operates on multiple integration types that define how data flows into Amplitude:

**Raw-Events Integration** serves as the primary ingestion method, streaming event data directly into Amplitude's analytics pipeline. This type supports real-time data flow from platforms like Braze, Segment, and various mobile attribution networks.

**Cohorts Integration** enables bidirectional data sharing, allowing Amplitude behavioral cohorts to be exported to external platforms while simultaneously importing audience data back into Amplitude for enhanced segmentation.

**Event-Streaming Integration** provides continuous data synchronization between platforms, particularly valuable for marketing automation and customer engagement tools.

**Attribution Integration** utilizes Amplitude's specialized Attribution API to handle mobile attribution data from networks like AppsFlyer, Adjust, and Branch, with specific requirements for Advertising ID (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) matching and 72-hour attribution windows.

## Data Warehouse and ETL Ecosystem

The catalog features robust support for major data warehouse platforms including **Snowflake**, **BigQuery**, **Databricks**, and **Amazon S3**. These integrations support sophisticated data transformation capabilities:

**Change Data Capture (CDC)** functionality enables real-time synchronization with support for Mirror Sync, Append Only Sync, and Timestamp-based import strategies. The Databricks integration leverages Change Data Feed (CDF) for delta sync operations, while Snowflake integration supports four distinct import strategies with specific SQL query requirements.

**Reverse ETL** capabilities through platforms like Hightouch and Census enable data warehouse data to flow back into Amplitude as raw events, creating comprehensive data loops for operational analytics.

## Marketing and Attribution Platform Integration

The catalog extensively covers the marketing technology stack with dedicated integrations for major advertising platforms:

**Advertising Networks** including Google Ads, Facebook Ads, LinkedIn Ads, TikTok Ads, and X Ads import campaign-level metrics as "Daily Ad Metrics" events with standardized properties like `ad_metrics.impressions`, `ad_metrics.clicks`, and `ad_metrics.cost`. These integrations support Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) calculations through UTM parameter tracking.

**Mobile Attribution Platforms** such as AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch, and Kochava utilize Amplitude's Attribution API for real-time attribution data streaming, with specific requirements for advertising ID matching and attribution event holding periods.

## Customer Engagement and Marketing Automation

The catalog includes comprehensive coverage of customer engagement platforms:

**Email Marketing Platforms** like Mailchimp, SendGrid, and HubSpot import email engagement events (opens, clicks, conversions) with specific user ID mapping requirements and webhook configurations.

**Marketing Automation Platforms** including Braze, Iterable, Leanplum, and MoEngage support bidirectional data flow, enabling both event ingestion and cohort export for targeted campaign execution.

**Customer Communication Platforms** such as OneSignal and Intercom stream messaging events across multiple channels (push notifications, email, SMS, in-app) for comprehensive engagement analytics.

## Subscription and Revenue Analytics

Specialized integrations for subscription management platforms include:

**Subscription Platforms** like RevenueCat, Adapty, Apphud, and Nami stream subscription monetization events and in-app purchase data, requiring user ID matching between platforms for revenue attribution.

**Payment Processing** through Stripe integration imports revenue events via webhooks, supporting various payment-related events like `payment_intent.succeeded` and `invoice.payment_succeeded` with currency normalization capabilities.

## Product Experience and User Research

The catalog covers user experience and feedback platforms:

**User Onboarding Platforms** including Userflow, Userguiding, Bento, and Chameleon stream product tour events and onboarding completion data for analyzing user activation funnels.

**Survey and Feedback Platforms** such as Qualtrics, Sprig, Survicate, and Blitzllama import survey response data and qualitative feedback, enabling correlation analysis between user satisfaction and product behavior.

## Key Technical Implementation Patterns

**Authentication Methods** vary by platform, including OAuth flows (HubSpot, LinkedIn Ads), API key authentication (most platforms), and service account configurations (Google Cloud platforms).

**User Identity Mapping** represents a critical integration requirement, with platforms supporting various identifier types including user_id, device_id, email addresses, and platform-specific identifiers like Amplitude's amplitudeDeviceId.

**Data Transformation and Mapping** capabilities include field mapping for event properties, user properties, and group properties, with support for JSON extraction, STRUCT type handling, and custom property enrichment.

**Regional Data Residency** support spans US and EU regions, with platform-specific endpoint configurations for compliance requirements.

## API Endpoints and Technical Specifications

The catalog utilizes several core Amplitude APIs:

- **HTTP V2 API** (`api.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`) for standard event ingestion
- **Attribution API** for mobile attribution data
- **Batch Upload API** for high-volume data imports
- **User Privacy API** for data compliance operations

Regional endpoints support EU data residency requirements with corresponding `.eu.amplitude.com` domains.

The source catalog represents Amplitude's comprehensive approach to data integration, enabling businesses to create unified customer data platforms that combine behavioral analytics with marketing attribution, revenue tracking, and customer engagement metrics across the entire customer lifecycle.
