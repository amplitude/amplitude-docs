Amplitude's Source Catalog represents a comprehensive ecosystem of data integrations that enables organizations to centralize behavioral analytics by ingesting data from diverse platforms and tools. The catalog encompasses over 60 integrations spanning marketing automation, attribution platforms, customer data platforms (CDPs), data warehouses, subscription management, experimentation tools, and customer engagement platforms.

## Core Integration Architecture

The source catalog operates on four primary integration types that define how data flows into Amplitude:

**Raw-Events Integration** serves as the most common pattern, directly ingesting event data from external platforms into Amplitude's analytics engine. This includes subscription events from RevenueCat and Adapty, survey responses from Sprig and Survicate, email engagement from SendGrid and HubSpot, and user behavior data from platforms like Convizit and Tribe.

**Event-Streaming Integration** enables real-time bidirectional data flow, supporting both data ingestion and cohort export capabilities. Notable implementations include Braze Currents, Iterable, and OneSignal integrations that sync messaging campaign data while enabling behavioral cohort targeting.

**Cohorts Integration** facilitates audience segmentation by importing user groups from external platforms and exporting Amplitude behavioral cohorts for targeted campaigns. This bidirectional capability is exemplified in integrations with Mailchimp, Qualtrics, and Split.

**Attribution Integration** leverages Amplitude's Attribution API to process mobile attribution data from platforms like Adjust, AppsFlyer, Branch, and Kochava, supporting advertising ID matching (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) with 72-hour attribution windows.

## Data Warehouse and Enterprise Sources

Enterprise-grade data warehouse integrations form a critical component, supporting sophisticated ETL/reverse ETL workflows:

**Amazon S3 Import** provides comprehensive file-based ingestion supporting JSON, CSV, and Parquet formats with IAM role authentication, converter configuration, and both Mirror Sync and Append Only strategies. The integration requires specific bucket organization with date prefix formats (YYYY/MM/DD/HH) and supports file sizes from 1MB to 1GB.

**BigQuery Data Import** utilizes Google Cloud Storage bucket offloading with service account permissions (BigQuery Job User, BigQuery Data Viewer, Storage Admin) and supports both time-based and full sync import methods with STRUCT data type handling and JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR transformations.

**Snowflake Integration** offers the most sophisticated data warehouse connectivity with four import strategies: Full Sync, Timestamp-based, Append Only Sync, and Mirror Sync. It includes Change Data Capture (CDC) functionality, comprehensive SQL query configuration, and supports OBJECT_CONSTRUCT JSON transformation with JWT token authentication.

**Databricks Integration** implements Change Data Feed (CDF) for delta sync capabilities, supporting both personal access token and service principal authentication with all-purpose compute cluster requirements.

## Marketing and Attribution Ecosystem

The catalog extensively covers marketing technology stack integrations:

**Facebook Ads and Google Ads** integrations import campaign-level metrics as "Daily Ad Metrics" events, including properties like ad_metrics.impressions, ad_metrics.clicks, and campaign_id for CAC/ROAS calculations. Both support UTM parameter handling and multi-account configurations.

**Google Analytics 4 (GA4)** integration operates through BigQuery linking with specific handling for GA4's export delays (72-hour daily, 24-hour streaming) and includes catch-up importing strategies for comprehensive web analytics data migration.

**Adobe Analytics** integration provides direct data import as raw events with specific field mappings including postvisidhigh/postvisidlow for user_id and custvisid for device_id, supporting cross-platform customer behavior tracking.

## Customer Engagement and Messaging Platforms

Messaging and customer engagement integrations enable comprehensive communication analytics:

**Braze Integration** supports bidirectional data flow through Braze Currents, enabling both event import from Braze's messaging channels and cohort export for targeted campaigns with comprehensive customer engagement analytics.

**Intercom Integration** syncs conversational data including conversation topics, contact topics, user topics, visitor topics, and event topics, all prefixed with "[Intercom]" for easy identification.

**OneSignal Integration** captures messaging events (sent, clicked, viewed, confirmed delivery) across push notifications, email, SMS, and in-app channels while supporting cohort-based targeting.

## Subscription and Revenue Analytics

Subscription management integrations provide comprehensive monetization analytics:

**RevenueCat Integration** enables mobile app subscription tracking with behavioral cohort analysis and cross-platform subscription management, supporting both proceeds and revenue reporting methodologies.

**Stripe Integration** imports revenue events via webhooks including payment_intent.succeeded, charge.succeeded, and invoice.payment_succeeded with user ID mapping priority and currency normalization.

**Adapty Integration** streams subscription monetization and in-app purchase events with specific user ID mapping requirements using amplitudeDeviceId and amplitudeUserId configuration.

## Experimentation and Product Analytics

Feature flagging and experimentation platforms integrate for comprehensive product analytics:

**Split Integration** imports feature flag traffic impression data as get_treatment events, supporting experimentation tracking and cohort targeting with behavioral analysis of flag treatments.

**Optimizely Integration** utilizes custom JSON analytics integration for syncing behavioral cohorts and experiment data, including campaign, experiment, and variation information through identify calls.

**Taplytics Integration** exports mobile A/B testing data via the Attribution API, sending experiment variations as TL_experiments events for cross-platform testing analysis.

## User Experience and Feedback Platforms

User experience and feedback integrations enable qualitative data analysis:

**Sprig and Survicate Integrations** capture in-product survey responses (CSAT, NPS) as raw events, enabling correlation analysis between user satisfaction and behavioral metrics.

**Userflow and Userguiding Integrations** track onboarding analytics including Flow Started events and Checklist Task Completed events for analyzing user activation and retention funnels.

**Chameleon Integration** sends product tour and guidance events for analyzing product adoption performance alongside behavioral data.

## Tag Management and Implementation

Tag management integrations provide flexible implementation options:

**Google Tag Manager** offers three distinct templates: current Browser SDK 2.0 template with autocapture capabilities, legacy template for backwards compatibility, and server-side template using HTTP V2 API for server-side data collection.

**Tealium Integration** supports both iQ Tag Management (TIQ) and AudienceStream Universal Data Hub implementations for comprehensive customer data platform connectivity.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

Key technical endpoints include:
- Attribution API for mobile attribution data
- HTTP V2 API for server-side implementations
- Lookup Table API for CSV data enrichment
- Project API keys for source authentication
- Regional endpoints (api.amplitude.com, api.eu.amplitude.com)

The source catalog demonstrates Amplitude's comprehensive approach to data unification, enabling organizations to create a centralized behavioral analytics hub that connects disparate tools and platforms across the entire customer journey, from acquisition through retention and monetization.
