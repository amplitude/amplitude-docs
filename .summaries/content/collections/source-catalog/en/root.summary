Amplitude's Source Catalog represents a comprehensive ecosystem of data integrations that enables businesses to centralize customer data from diverse platforms into Amplitude's analytics infrastructure. The catalog encompasses over 70 integrations spanning attribution platforms, marketing automation tools, data warehouses, customer engagement platforms, and specialized analytics services.

## Core Integration Architecture

The source catalog operates on four primary integration types that define how data flows into Amplitude:

**Raw-Events Integration** forms the foundation, streaming event data directly into Amplitude's analytics pipeline. This includes behavioral events, transaction data, and user interactions from platforms like Braze, Segment, and mParticle.

**Event-Streaming Integration** provides real-time data synchronization for attribution and marketing platforms like AppsFlyer, Branch, and Kochava, utilizing Amplitude's Attribution API for immediate user attribution tracking.

**Cohorts Integration** enables bidirectional data flow, allowing behavioral segments created in Amplitude to be exported back to marketing platforms like HubSpot, Braze, and OneSignal for targeted campaign execution.

**Server-Side Integration** handles enterprise-grade data imports from platforms requiring OAuth authentication or complex data transformations, including Salesforce, Intercom, and various ad networks.

## Data Warehouse and Cloud Storage Ecosystem

The catalog features robust support for major cloud data platforms through specialized import mechanisms:

**Amazon S3 Import** provides bidirectional sync capabilities with IAM role configuration, converter mapping, and support for Mirror Sync versus Append Only strategies with mutation operations (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE).

**BigQuery Integration** leverages Google Cloud's data warehouse through BigQuery linking, supporting both GA4 imports and direct BigQuery table ingestion with Change Data Feed capabilities and SQL transformation requirements for STRUCT types.

**Snowflake Integration** offers four distinct import strategies (Full Sync, Timestamp, Append Only, Mirror Sync) with Change Data Capture support and specialized SQL query requirements using OBJECT_CONSTRUCT functions.

**Databricks Integration** utilizes Change Data Feed (CDF) for delta sync operations with all-purpose compute clusters and personal access token authentication.

## Attribution and Marketing Analytics Framework

The source catalog emphasizes marketing attribution through specialized integrations:

**Mobile Attribution Platforms** including AppsFlyer, Adjust, Kochava, and Singular utilize Amplitude's Attribution API with 72-hour attribution matching windows and Advertising ID (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) requirements for user matching.

**Ad Network Integrations** for Facebook Ads, Google Ads, LinkedIn Ads, TikTok Ads, and X Ads import campaign-level metrics as "Daily Ad Metrics" events with properties like ad_metrics.impressions, ad_metrics.clicks, and UTM parameter support for CAC/ROAS calculations.

**Marketing Automation Platforms** such as Braze, HubSpot, Iterable, and Mailchimp provide bidirectional data flow for campaign event ingestion and behavioral cohort targeting.

## Customer Engagement and Experience Platforms

The catalog includes comprehensive support for customer experience tools:

**Survey and Feedback Platforms** like Qualtrics, Sprig, Survicate, and Blitzllama stream qualitative feedback data with automatic email-based user mapping and survey response categorization.

**Customer Support Integration** through Intercom provides conversation, contact, and user event streaming with OAuth authentication and automatic "[Intercom]" event prefixing.

**Onboarding and Product Tour Platforms** including Userflow, Userguiding, Bento, and Chameleon track user activation through step completion events and guide engagement metrics.

## Subscription and Revenue Analytics

Specialized integrations focus on subscription business models:

**Subscription Management Platforms** like RevenueCat, Adapty, Apphud, and Nami stream subscription events, revenue data, and in-app purchase analytics with user ID matching requirements.

**Payment Processing Integration** through Stripe imports revenue events via webhooks with support for payment_intent.succeeded, invoice.payment_succeeded, and other financial transaction events.

## Key Technical Implementation Patterns

**Authentication Methods** vary by platform, including API key configuration (most common), OAuth flows (HubSpot, Intercom, LinkedIn Ads), and service account setup (Google Cloud services).

**User Identity Mapping** requires alignment between platform user identifiers and Amplitude's user_id/device_id system, with specific mapping configurations for each integration.

**Event Volume and Quotas** are managed through batch processing, real-time streaming limits, and partner-specific rate limiting based on integration type and data volume.

**Data Transformation** occurs through converter configurations, SQL query requirements for warehouse integrations, and automatic field mapping for standardized event schemas.

The source catalog represents Amplitude's strategy to become the central analytics hub for modern data stacks, providing comprehensive coverage across the customer journey from acquisition through retention, with particular strength in mobile attribution, marketing automation, and subscription analytics use cases.
