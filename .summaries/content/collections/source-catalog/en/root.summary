## Amplitude Source Catalog

Amplitude's Source Catalog represents a comprehensive ecosystem of data integrations that enable organizations to centralize behavioral analytics by importing data from diverse platforms and tools. The catalog encompasses over 60 integrations spanning marketing automation, attribution platforms, customer data platforms, data warehouses, survey tools, and specialized analytics services.

## Integration Architecture and Relationships

The source catalog operates through multiple integration patterns that define how data flows into Amplitude:

**Raw Events Integration** forms the foundation, where external platforms send event data directly to Amplitude's HTTP V2 API. This pattern is used by platforms like Braze, HubSpot, Intercom, and subscription management tools like RevenueCat and Adapty to stream user behavioral events, campaign interactions, and monetization data.

**Event Streaming Integration** enables real-time bidirectional data flow, commonly implemented by customer engagement platforms like OneSignal, MoEngage, and Iterable to synchronize messaging events while leveraging Amplitude's behavioral cohorts for targeted campaigns.

**Cohorts Integration** supports exporting Amplitude's behavioral segments to external platforms for activation, enabling tools like Optimizely, Split, and various marketing automation platforms to target users based on product usage patterns.

**Attribution Integration** utilizes Amplitude's specialized Attribution API to ingest mobile attribution data from platforms like AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch, and Kochava, supporting advertising ID matching (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) with typical 72-hour attribution windows.

**Warehouse Integration** provides enterprise-grade data import capabilities through platforms like Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, and Amazon S3, supporting multiple sync strategies including Full Sync, Mirror Sync, Append Only, and Change Data Capture (CDC) for real-time data synchronization.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Integration Types** define the technical implementation pattern:
- `raw-events`: Direct event ingestion via HTTP V2 API
- `event-streaming`: Bidirectional real-time data flow
- `cohorts`: Behavioral segment export capability
- `attribution`: Mobile attribution data via Attribution API

**Integration Categories** classify business use cases:
- `marketing-automation`: Campaign and messaging platforms
- `subscription-management`: Monetization and revenue tracking
- `customer-engagement`: User experience and onboarding tools
- `experimentation`: A/B testing and feature flag platforms
- `qualitative-feedback`: Survey and feedback collection
- `warehouse`: Enterprise data infrastructure

**User Identity Mapping** ensures data consistency across platforms through various identifier strategies:
- `user_id`: Primary user identifier synchronization
- `device_id`: Device-level tracking alignment
- `amplitudeUserId`/`amplitudeDeviceId`: Platform-specific mapping
- `customerUserId`: Cross-platform user correlation

**Data Delivery Patterns** define ingestion frequency and methods:
- Real-time streaming via webhooks
- Batch processing (hourly/daily intervals)
- API-based synchronization
- File-based imports (CSV/JSON/Parquet)

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The source catalog integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem through several key touchpoints:

**Amplitude Data** serves as the central ingestion layer, processing events from all source integrations and applying data governance, schema validation, and user privacy controls before routing to analytics workspaces.

**Behavioral Cohorts** created from source data can be exported back to marketing and engagement platforms, creating closed-loop optimization workflows where product usage insights drive campaign targeting and personalization.

**Attribution Analysis** combines mobile attribution data from MMPs (Mobile Measurement Partners) with first-party behavioral events to provide comprehensive user acquisition and marketing ROI analysis.

**Revenue Analytics** integrates subscription and transaction data from platforms like Stripe, RevenueCat, and Adapty with user behavioral patterns to enable advanced monetization analysis and customer lifetime value optimization.

**Cross-Platform Identity Resolution** unifies user journeys across web, mobile, and server-side touchpoints by correlating identifiers from various source platforms.

## Technical Implementation Patterns

**Authentication Methods** vary by integration type:
- API key authentication for most raw events integrations
- OAuth flows for platforms like HubSpot, Intercom, and social advertising platforms
- Service account authentication for warehouse integrations
- Webhook-based authentication for real-time event streaming

**Data Transformation** occurs through multiple mechanisms:
- Converter configurations for warehouse imports using JSON mapping rules
- Field mapping for CRM and marketing automation platforms
- Event property standardization across different source schemas
- User property enrichment through lookup tables and cross-platform data correlation

**Specific API Endpoints** include:
- `api.amplitude.com/httpapi/v2` for raw events ingestion
- `api.amplitude.com/attribution` for mobile attribution data
- Platform-specific webhook endpoints like `api.amplitude.com/sendgrid`
- Regional endpoints supporting EU data residency requirements

**Command Line and Configuration Examples**:
- BigQuery SQL transformations using `JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR` functions
- Snowflake CDC queries with `OBJECT_CONSTRUCT` for JSON property handling
- GTM template configurations for client-side and server-side implementations
- Webhook URL configurations for platforms like Stripe and SendGrid

The source catalog represents Amplitude's strategy to become the central nervous system for product analytics by providing comprehensive data ingestion capabilities that support the full spectrum of modern digital product development and marketing workflows.
