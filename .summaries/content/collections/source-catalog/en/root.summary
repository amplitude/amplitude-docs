Amplitude's Source Catalog represents a comprehensive ecosystem of data integrations that enables organizations to centralize behavioral analytics by ingesting data from diverse platforms and tools. The catalog encompasses over 60 integrations spanning marketing automation, attribution tracking, customer engagement, subscription management, data warehouses, and experimentation platforms.

## Core Integration Architecture

The source catalog operates on several fundamental integration types that define how data flows into Amplitude:

**Raw-Events Integration** serves as the primary mechanism for ingesting event data directly into Amplitude's analytics platform. This integration type captures user actions, system events, and behavioral data in real-time or batch processing modes, maintaining full event fidelity and enabling comprehensive behavioral analysis.

**Event-Streaming Integration** facilitates real-time data synchronization between platforms, ensuring that user actions and system events are immediately available for analysis and activation across the integrated ecosystem.

**Cohorts Integration** enables bidirectional data flow, allowing Amplitude's behavioral cohorts to be exported to external platforms for targeted campaigns while simultaneously importing segmentation data from partner platforms.

**Attribution Integration** leverages Amplitude's Attribution API to capture marketing attribution data, typically with specific requirements around advertising ID matching (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) and attribution windows (commonly 72 hours).

## Data Warehouse and ETL Ecosystem

The catalog includes robust support for modern data infrastructure through integrations with major cloud data warehouses including Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, and Amazon S3. These integrations support multiple synchronization strategies:

**Mirror Sync** maintains exact replicas of source data with support for INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations through Change Data Capture (CDC) functionality. **Append Only Sync** focuses on incremental data ingestion without modification of existing records. **Full Sync** performs complete data refreshes, while **Timestamp-based Import** enables incremental updates based on temporal markers.

Key warehouse integrations utilize sophisticated authentication mechanisms including service accounts, personal access tokens (PAT), and JWT authentication, with specific permission requirements like BigQuery Job User, BigQuery Data Viewer, and Storage Admin roles.

## Marketing and Attribution Platform Integration

The catalog extensively covers marketing attribution and campaign analytics through integrations with platforms like Facebook Ads, Google Ads, AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch, and Singular. These integrations typically import campaign-level metrics as "Daily Ad Metrics" events with properties including ad_metrics.impressions, ad_metrics.clicks, ad_metrics.cost, campaign_id, and ad_group_id.

Attribution integrations commonly require Advertising ID matching and operate within specific attribution windows. The integrations support UTM parameter mapping and enable calculation of key metrics like Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and Return on Ad Spend (ROAS).

## Customer Engagement and Communication Platforms

A significant portion of the catalog addresses customer engagement through integrations with platforms like Braze, HubSpot, Intercom, OneSignal, SendGrid, and Mailchimp. These integrations capture communication events including email opens, clicks, SMS interactions, push notification engagement, and in-app messaging activities.

The engagement platform integrations typically support bidirectional data flow, enabling both the import of communication events into Amplitude and the export of behavioral cohorts for targeted messaging campaigns. Events are commonly prefixed with platform identifiers (e.g., "[Intercom]", "[Sendgrid]") for clear source attribution.

## Subscription and Revenue Analytics

The catalog includes specialized integrations for subscription and revenue tracking through platforms like RevenueCat, Adapty, Stripe, Apphud, and Nami. These integrations focus on subscription lifecycle events, in-app purchase tracking, revenue attribution, and subscription management analytics.

Revenue integrations typically require careful user ID mapping between platforms and support various revenue event types including payment_intent.succeeded, charge.succeeded, and subscription renewal events. The integrations enable analysis of subscription funnels, churn prediction, and lifetime value calculations.

## Experimentation and Feature Management

The catalog supports experimentation platforms including Optimizely, Split, and Taplytics, enabling the import of experiment exposure data, feature flag impressions, and A/B test results. These integrations typically send experiment data through identify calls or dedicated events like "TL_experiments" with experiment-to-variation mappings.

Feature flag integrations capture traffic impression data and support behavioral analysis of flag treatments, enabling impact measurement of feature releases and controlled rollouts.

## Survey and Feedback Platforms

Qualitative feedback integration is supported through platforms like Qualtrics, Sprig, Survicate, and Blitzllama. These integrations capture survey responses, CSAT scores, NPS ratings, and qualitative feedback data as structured events with properties like survey_name, question_id, and answer values.

Feedback integrations enable correlation analysis between qualitative feedback and quantitative behavioral metrics, supporting the creation of satisfaction-based cohorts and feedback-driven product optimization.

## Authentication and Configuration Patterns

The integrations utilize various authentication mechanisms including API keys, OAuth flows, webhook configurations, and service account authentication. Most integrations require Amplitude project API keys and support region-specific endpoints for US and EU data residency requirements.

Common configuration patterns include user ID mapping between platforms, device ID synchronization, and event property transformation. Many integrations support custom field mapping and provide guided configuration interfaces for non-technical users.

## Data Processing and Transformation

The catalog includes sophisticated data transformation capabilities through converter configurations, JSON mapping rules, and SQL-based transformations. Warehouse integrations support complex data type handling including STRUCT types, VARIANT JSON data, and nested object transformations using functions like JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR and OBJECT_CONSTRUCT.

File-based integrations support multiple formats including JSON, CSV, and Parquet with compression options and specific organizational requirements like date prefix formats (YYYY/MM/DD/HH) and file size constraints (typically 1MB-1GB).

## Integration Management and Monitoring

The source catalog provides comprehensive integration management through Amplitude's Data Sources interface, supporting configuration import/export, sync cadence management (hourly/daily), and integration health monitoring. Many integrations include specific setup requirements like Customer Success Manager enablement, account manager coordination, or enterprise plan prerequisites.

The catalog maintains clear categorization of integrations by type (marketing-automation, subscription-management, customer-engagement, etc.) and indicates whether integrations are partner-maintained or Amplitude-maintained, providing transparency around support and maintenance responsibilities.
