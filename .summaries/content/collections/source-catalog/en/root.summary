Amplitude's Source Catalog represents a comprehensive ecosystem of data integrations that enables organizations to centralize behavioral analytics by ingesting data from diverse platforms and tools. The catalog encompasses over 60 source integrations spanning marketing automation, attribution platforms, customer data platforms, subscription management, survey tools, experimentation platforms, and data warehouses.

## Core Integration Architecture

The source catalog operates on several fundamental integration types that define how data flows into Amplitude:

**Raw-Events Integration** serves as the primary mechanism for ingesting event data directly into Amplitude projects, transforming external platform events into Amplitude's event schema. This integration type supports real-time data streaming and batch processing, with events maintaining their original properties while being mapped to Amplitude's user_id, device_id, and event_properties structure.

**Event-Streaming Integration** enables bidirectional data flow, allowing platforms to both send data to Amplitude and receive behavioral cohorts for targeted campaigns and personalization.

**Cohorts Integration** facilitates the export of Amplitude's behavioral segments to external platforms for marketing automation, personalization, and customer engagement campaigns.

**Attribution Integration** leverages Amplitude's Attribution API to ingest marketing attribution data, typically with 72-hour attribution windows and advertising ID (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) matching requirements.

## Data Warehouse and ETL Ecosystem

The catalog includes sophisticated warehouse integrations supporting multiple import strategies:

**Amazon S3 Import** provides bucket-based ingestion with IAM role authentication, supporting Mirror Sync and Append Only strategies with converter configuration for JSON/CSV/parquet formats and chronological file ordering requirements.

**BigQuery Data Import** utilizes GCS bucket offloading with Service Account permissions (BigQuery Job User, BigQuery Data Viewer, Storage Admin), supporting both time-based and full sync import methods with STRUCT data type handling and JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR transformations.

**Snowflake Integration** implements Change Data Capture (CDC) functionality with four import strategies (Full Sync, Timestamp, Append Only Sync, Mirror Sync), utilizing OBJECT_CONSTRUCT SQL functions and VARIANT JSON data types with key pair authentication.

**Databricks Integration** employs Change Data Feed (CDF) for delta sync capabilities, supporting personal access token authentication and unity catalog permissions with all-purpose compute cluster requirements.

## Marketing and Attribution Platform Integration

The catalog extensively covers marketing attribution and campaign analytics:

**Facebook Ads and Google Ads** integrations import campaign-level metrics as "Daily Ad Metrics" events, including ad_metrics.impressions, ad_metrics.clicks, and ad_metrics.cost properties for CAC and ROAS calculations.

**Attribution Platforms** including AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch, Kochava, and Singular utilize the Attribution API for mobile attribution data with ADID matching and 72-hour attribution windows.

**Marketing Automation Platforms** such as Braze, HubSpot, Iterable, Leanplum, and MoEngage support bidirectional integration for campaign event ingestion and cohort targeting.

## Customer Data Platform and Tag Management

**Segment Integration** provides comprehensive bidirectional data flow through the Amplitude (Actions) destination, supporting client-side bundled integration and server-side sources with SDK function mappings (track, identify, screen, alias, group).

**Google Tag Manager** offers multiple implementation options including client-side Browser SDK 2.0 template, server-side HTTP V2 API template, and legacy maintenance SDK template with breaking changes documentation for migration paths.

**Customer Data Platforms** including mParticle, Tealium, and RudderStack enable raw event streaming from unified customer data infrastructure.

## Subscription and Revenue Analytics

**Subscription Management Platforms** including RevenueCat, Adapty, Apphud, and Nami provide mobile app subscription event tracking with revenue analytics and behavioral cohort analysis capabilities.

**Stripe Integration** imports revenue events via webhooks, supporting payment_intent.succeeded, charge.succeeded, and invoice.payment_succeeded events with user ID mapping priority and currency normalization.

## Survey and Feedback Integration

**Qualitative Feedback Platforms** including Qualtrics, Sprig, Survicate, and Blitzllama enable survey response data ingestion as raw events with automatic email-based User_ID mapping and satisfaction-based cohort creation.

## Experimentation and Feature Flag Integration

**A/B Testing Platforms** including Optimizely, Split, and Taplytics provide experiment data ingestion through custom analytics integrations, traffic impression data import, and experiment variation tracking with behavioral cohort targeting.

## Key Technical Specifications

**Authentication Methods** vary by platform, including OAuth flows, API key authentication, service account permissions, and webhook configurations with specific endpoint requirements for US/EU data residency.

**User ID Mapping** represents a critical integration requirement, with platforms supporting various mapping strategies including email fallback, device ID synchronization, and custom identifier matching (amplitudeDeviceId, customerUserId).

**Data Delivery Intervals** range from real-time streaming to batch processing with specific intervals (30-minute, hourly, daily) depending on platform capabilities and data volume considerations.

**Regional Considerations** include EU data residency support, regional IP allowlisting requirements, and data center selection (US/EU) for compliance with data governance requirements.

The source catalog enables organizations to create comprehensive customer journey analytics by unifying data from acquisition (attribution platforms), engagement (marketing automation), conversion (subscription management), satisfaction (survey platforms), and experimentation (A/B testing tools) into Amplitude's behavioral analytics platform.
