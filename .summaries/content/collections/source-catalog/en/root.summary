Amplitude's Source Catalog represents a comprehensive ecosystem of data integrations that enables organizations to centralize behavioral analytics by ingesting data from diverse platforms and tools. The catalog encompasses over 60 integrations spanning marketing automation, attribution tracking, customer engagement, subscription management, data warehouses, and experimentation platforms.

## Core Integration Architecture

The source catalog operates on four primary integration types that define how data flows into Amplitude:

**Raw-Events Integration** serves as the most common pattern, directly ingesting event data from external platforms into Amplitude's analytics engine. This includes subscription events from RevenueCat and Adapty, survey responses from Sprig and Survicate, and user behavior data from platforms like Convizit and Tribe.

**Event-Streaming Integration** enables real-time bidirectional data flow, allowing platforms like Braze, Iterable, and OneSignal to both send events to Amplitude and receive behavioral cohorts for targeted campaigns.

**Cohorts Integration** facilitates audience segmentation by sharing Amplitude's behavioral cohorts with marketing platforms like Mailchimp, Leanplum, and Insider for personalized customer experiences.

**Attribution Integration** leverages Amplitude's Attribution API to process mobile attribution data from platforms like Adjust, AppsFlyer, Branch, and Kochava, typically with 72-hour attribution windows and advertising ID matching requirements.

## Data Warehouse and ETL Ecosystem

The catalog includes sophisticated warehouse integrations supporting multiple import strategies. **Snowflake integration** offers four sync methods (Full Sync, Timestamp, Append Only, Mirror Sync) with Change Data Capture (CDC) functionality. **BigQuery integration** handles GA4 data imports with specific considerations for 72-hour daily export delays and STRUCT type transformations. **Databricks integration** utilizes Change Data Feed (CDF) for delta sync operations with all-purpose compute clusters.

Cloud storage integrations for **Amazon S3** and **Google Cloud Storage** support both Mirror Sync and Append Only strategies with converter configurations, IAM role setup, and chronological file ordering requirements. These integrations handle JSON, CSV, and Parquet formats with file size requirements between 1MB-1GB.

## Marketing and Attribution Ecosystem

The catalog extensively covers marketing attribution through mobile measurement platforms (MMPs) like AppsFlyer, Adjust, and Kochava, all utilizing Amplitude's Attribution API with ADID/IDFA matching and 72-hour attribution windows. **Facebook Ads** and **Google Ads** integrations import campaign-level metrics as "Daily Ad Metrics" events with properties like ad_metrics.impressions, ad_metrics.clicks, and UTM parameter mapping for CAC/ROAS calculations.

Email marketing platforms including **HubSpot**, **SendGrid**, **Mailchimp**, and **Braze** stream engagement events (opens, clicks, deliveries) while supporting bidirectional cohort sharing for targeted campaigns.

## Customer Engagement and Experience Platforms

User onboarding and product experience tools form a significant category, with integrations from **Chameleon**, **Userflow**, **Userguiding**, and **Bento** streaming product tour events, step completion tracking, and guide engagement metrics. These platforms typically require user_id matching and support both raw-events and cohorts integration types.

Survey and feedback platforms like **Qualtrics**, **Sprig**, and **Survicate** enable qualitative feedback analysis by streaming survey responses with automatic email-based user ID mapping and support for CSAT/NPS survey data.

## Subscription and Revenue Analytics

Subscription management platforms including **RevenueCat**, **Adapty**, **Apphud**, and **Nami** stream in-app purchase events and subscription lifecycle data, enabling behavioral cohort analysis of subscription customers. **Stripe integration** imports revenue events via webhooks with user ID mapping priority and currency normalization.

## Tag Management and CDP Integrations

**Google Tag Manager** offers multiple templates: a client-side template using Browser SDK 2.0 with autocapture capabilities, a server-side template using HTTP V2 API, and a legacy template with migration guidance. **Segment integration** provides bidirectional data flow with both Actions and Classic destinations, supporting client-side bundled integration and server-side sources.

Customer Data Platforms like **Tealium**, **mParticle**, **RudderStack**, and **MetaRouter** enable comprehensive data orchestration with Universal Data Object (UDO) configurations and cross-platform SDK support.

## Key Technical Specifications

**Authentication Methods** vary by platform: OAuth for Intercom and Mailchimp, API key authentication for most integrations, service account permissions for warehouse integrations, and webhook configurations for real-time data streaming.

**User ID Mapping** represents a critical requirement across integrations, with platforms supporting various mapping strategies including email fallback (Intercom), amplitudeDeviceId mapping (Adapty), and unique_arg parameters (SendGrid).

**Data Delivery Intervals** range from real-time streaming (attribution platforms) to 30-minute intervals (Convizit) to hourly syncing (HubSpot), with some platforms offering configurable sync cadences.

**Regional Considerations** include EU data residency support for platforms like Google Tag Manager and SendGrid, with specific endpoint configurations (api.eu.amplitude.com) for European data centers.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

Key API endpoints include:
- **Attribution API**: Used by mobile attribution platforms for real-time attribution data
- **HTTP V2 API**: Standard endpoint for event ingestion and server-side implementations  
- **Lookup Table API**: For CSV data import and property enrichment
- **User Privacy API**: Integrated with warehouse sources for data compliance

The catalog supports various SDK integrations including JavaScript SDK, Browser SDK 2.0, React Native SDK, and platform-specific mobile SDKs, with specific implementation patterns like `amplitude.getInstance()` method calls and `window.amplitude` browser integrations.

This comprehensive source ecosystem enables organizations to create a unified view of customer behavior across all touchpoints while maintaining flexibility in data architecture and supporting both technical and non-technical implementation approaches.
