## Amplitude Source Catalog

Amplitude's Source Catalog represents a comprehensive ecosystem of data integrations that enable businesses to centralize customer behavior analytics from diverse platforms and tools. The catalog encompasses over 70 integrations spanning attribution platforms, marketing automation tools, data warehouses, customer engagement platforms, and specialized analytics services.

## Integration Architecture and Data Flow

The source catalog operates through several distinct integration patterns:

**Raw Events Integration**: The most common integration type, where external platforms stream event data directly into Amplitude's analytics pipeline. These events maintain their original structure while being enriched with Amplitude's standard properties like `user_id`, `device_id`, `event_type`, and `event_properties`.

**Attribution API Integration**: Specialized for mobile attribution platforms (AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch, Kochava), these integrations require Advertising ID matching (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) and typically include a 72-hour attribution window for user matching.

**Cohorts Integration**: Bidirectional integrations that not only import data but also enable exporting Amplitude behavioral cohorts to external platforms for targeted campaigns and personalization.

**Warehouse Integrations**: Enterprise-grade connections to data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks) supporting multiple sync strategies including Full Sync, Mirror Sync, Append Only, and Change Data Capture (CDC) for real-time data synchronization.

## Key Integration Categories

**Marketing and Attribution Platforms**: Facebook Ads, Google Ads, LinkedIn Ads, TikTok Ads, and X Ads import campaign-level metrics as "Daily Ad Metrics" events with properties like `ad_metrics.impressions`, `ad_metrics.clicks`, and `ad_metrics.cost` for CAC/ROAS calculations. Attribution platforms like AppsFlyer, Adjust, and Branch provide mobile attribution data through the Attribution API.

**Customer Engagement and Marketing Automation**: Platforms like Braze, Iterable, SendGrid, OneSignal, and Mailchimp stream messaging events (sent, opened, clicked) while supporting bidirectional cohort sharing for targeted campaigns.

**Subscription and Revenue Management**: RevenueCat, Adapty, Stripe, and Nami provide subscription lifecycle events and revenue data, enabling comprehensive monetization analytics and churn analysis.

**Product Experience and Onboarding**: Tools like Chameleon, Userflow, Userguiding, and Bento track product tour completion, onboarding progress, and feature adoption events for user activation analysis.

**Data Infrastructure**: Segment, mParticle, Tealium, and RudderStack serve as customer data platforms (CDPs) that aggregate data from multiple sources before streaming to Amplitude.

## Technical Implementation Patterns

**Authentication Methods**: Integrations use various authentication patterns including OAuth (HubSpot, LinkedIn Ads), API keys (most integrations), service accounts (Google Cloud services), and webhook configurations (Stripe, SendGrid).

**User Identity Mapping**: Critical for data correlation, integrations support multiple identity resolution methods including `user_id` matching, email-based mapping, `device_id` synchronization, and custom identifier fields like `amplitudeUserId` or `customerUserId`.

**Data Transformation**: Warehouse integrations support SQL transformations for handling complex data types like STRUCT columns in BigQuery, VARIANT types in Snowflake, and JSON property extraction using functions like `JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR`.

**Event Naming Conventions**: Many integrations prefix events with platform identifiers (e.g., "[Intercom]", "[Mailchimp]") to distinguish source systems, while maintaining consistent property naming for cross-platform analysis.

## Enterprise Data Warehouse Integration

The catalog includes sophisticated warehouse integrations supporting:

**Snowflake Integration**: Features Change Data Capture (CDC), Mirror Sync capabilities, key pair authentication, and specific requirements for `DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS` and `ABORT_DETACHED_QUERY` settings.

**BigQuery Integration**: Requires GCS bucket configuration, service account permissions (BigQuery Job User, Storage Admin), and supports both daily and streaming table exports with catch-up importing strategies.

**Databricks Integration**: Utilizes Change Data Feed (CDF) for delta sync operations, requires all-purpose compute clusters, and supports both personal access tokens and service principal authentication.

## API Endpoints and Technical Specifications

Key API endpoints include:
- `api.amplitude.com/sendgrid` for SendGrid webhook integration
- `api.amplitude.com/iterable` for Iterable campaign data
- Attribution API endpoints for mobile attribution platforms
- HTTP V2 API for warehouse and server-side integrations

The catalog supports various data formats including JSON, CSV, and Parquet files, with specific requirements for chronological ordering, insert_id deduplication, and event volume management.

## Ecosystem Integration Strategy

The Source Catalog positions Amplitude as the central analytics hub in modern data stacks, connecting seamlessly with marketing automation platforms, customer engagement tools, attribution providers, and data infrastructure components. This comprehensive integration ecosystem enables businesses to create unified customer journey analytics, combining quantitative behavioral data with qualitative feedback, marketing attribution, and revenue metrics for complete customer lifecycle analysis.
