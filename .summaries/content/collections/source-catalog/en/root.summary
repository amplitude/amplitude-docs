Amplitude's Source Catalog represents a comprehensive ecosystem of data integrations that enables businesses to centralize customer data from diverse platforms into Amplitude's analytics infrastructure. The catalog encompasses over 70 integrations spanning attribution platforms, marketing automation tools, data warehouses, customer engagement platforms, and specialized analytics services.

## Core Integration Architecture

The source catalog operates on multiple integration types that define how data flows into Amplitude:

**Raw Events Integration** forms the foundation, ingesting event data directly into Amplitude's analytics pipeline. This includes behavioral events, transaction data, and user interactions from platforms like Braze, HubSpot, Intercom, and mobile attribution providers.

**Cohorts Integration** enables bidirectional data flow, allowing Amplitude behavioral cohorts to be exported to external platforms for targeted campaigns while importing audience data back into Amplitude for enhanced segmentation.

**Event Streaming** provides real-time data synchronization between platforms, particularly valuable for attribution providers like AppsFlyer, Adjust, and Branch that require immediate user matching and attribution windows.

**Attribution API Integration** specifically handles mobile attribution data with strict requirements for Advertising ID (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) matching and 72-hour attribution windows for user correlation.

## Data Warehouse and ETL Ecosystem

The catalog includes sophisticated warehouse integrations supporting enterprise-scale data operations:

**Cloud Data Warehouses** (BigQuery, Snowflake, Databricks) feature advanced capabilities including Change Data Capture (CDC), Mirror Sync vs Append Only strategies, and complex SQL transformations for handling STRUCT types and JSON properties fields. These integrations support mutation operations (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) and require specific IAM roles and service account configurations.

**Reverse ETL Platforms** (Census, Hightouch, RudderStack) enable operational analytics by syncing warehouse data back into Amplitude as raw events, creating closed-loop data ecosystems.

**Cloud Storage Integrations** (Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage) provide file-based ingestion with converter configurations, supporting JSON/CSV/parquet formats and requiring specific folder structures with YYYY/MM/DD/HH date prefixes.

## Marketing and Attribution Infrastructure

The catalog extensively covers marketing technology with specialized integrations for:

**Advertising Platforms** (Facebook Ads, Google Ads, LinkedIn Ads, TikTok Ads, X Ads) that import campaign-level metrics as "Daily Ad Metrics" events with properties like `ad_metrics.impressions`, `ad_metrics.clicks`, and `ad_metrics.cost`, enabling CAC/ROAS calculations through UTM parameter tracking.

**Mobile Attribution Providers** (AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch, Kochava, Singular) that utilize Amplitude's Attribution API for real-time user attribution with strict Advertising ID matching requirements and attribution event holding periods.

**Email and Messaging Platforms** (SendGrid, Mailchimp, OneSignal) that track engagement metrics across communication channels with event prefixes and user ID mapping via unique parameters.

## Customer Engagement and Experience Platforms

The catalog includes comprehensive coverage of customer experience tools:

**Customer Engagement Platforms** (Braze, Intercom, Cordial, MoEngage) support bidirectional data flow for personalized messaging campaigns based on behavioral cohorts.

**User Onboarding and Product Experience** (Userflow, Userguiding, Chameleon, Bento) track in-app guidance events, product tour completions, and onboarding funnel progression.

**Survey and Feedback Platforms** (Qualtrics, Sprig, Survicate, Blitzllama) import qualitative feedback data for correlation with quantitative behavioral analytics.

## Subscription and Revenue Analytics

Specialized integrations handle subscription economy data:

**Subscription Management Platforms** (RevenueCat, Adapty, Apphud, Nami) stream subscription events, revenue data, and in-app purchase analytics with user ID matching requirements between platforms.

**Payment Processing** (Stripe) imports revenue events via webhooks with support for payment_intent.succeeded, invoice.payment_succeeded, and other financial transaction events.

## Key Technical Nomenclature

**API Key Authentication** serves as the primary authentication method across most integrations, with platform-specific variations including OAuth flows for enterprise platforms.

**User ID Mapping** requires alignment between platform identifiers (customerUserId, amplitudeUserId, Identity ID) to enable cross-platform user journey tracking.

**Event Properties and User Properties** follow Amplitude's HTTP V2 API specification with JSON field mapping for custom attributes and behavioral data.

**Insert ID Deduplication** prevents duplicate event ingestion across multiple data sources and batch imports.

**Partner-Maintained vs Amplitude-Maintained** designations indicate integration ownership and support responsibility.

## Enterprise and Compliance Features

The catalog includes enterprise-grade capabilities:

**EU Data Residency** support across multiple integrations for GDPR compliance with region-specific API endpoints (api.eu.amplitude.com).

**User Privacy API Integration** enables data deletion and privacy compliance across warehouse sources.

**Schema Enforcement** ensures data quality and consistency across imported events and properties.

## Implementation Patterns

Common implementation patterns include:

**Webhook Configuration** for real-time event streaming from platforms like Stripe, SendGrid, and Mailchimp to Amplitude endpoints.

**SDK Integration Requirements** where platforms require both source platform SDKs and Amplitude SDKs for proper user matching and event correlation.

**Batch vs Real-time Processing** with daily batch imports for advertising platforms versus real-time streaming for user behavior tracking.

**Event Volume Quotas** that impact integration selection and data flow management across the analytics infrastructure.

The source catalog represents Amplitude's comprehensive approach to data centralization, enabling businesses to create unified customer data platforms that combine behavioral analytics with marketing attribution, revenue tracking, and customer engagement metrics across the entire customer lifecycle.
