Amplitude's Source Catalog represents a comprehensive ecosystem of data integrations that enables businesses to centralize behavioral analytics, marketing attribution, and customer engagement data from diverse platforms into Amplitude's analytics infrastructure. The catalog encompasses over 70 integrations spanning attribution platforms, marketing automation tools, data warehouses, customer engagement platforms, and specialized analytics services.

## Core Integration Architecture

The source catalog operates on four primary integration types that define how data flows into Amplitude:

**Raw-Events Integration** serves as the most common pattern, ingesting event data directly into Amplitude's analytics pipeline using the HTTP V2 API specification. This approach maintains event granularity and enables comprehensive behavioral analysis across user journeys.

**Cohorts Integration** enables bidirectional data flow, allowing platforms to both send data to Amplitude and receive behavioral cohorts for targeted campaigns and personalization efforts.

**Attribution Integration** utilizes Amplitude's specialized Attribution API to handle mobile attribution data, typically requiring Advertising ID (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) matching with 72-hour attribution windows for user matching.

**Event-Streaming Integration** provides real-time data synchronization between platforms, supporting continuous behavioral tracking and immediate analytics updates.

## Data Warehouse and ETL Ecosystem

The catalog features robust support for major data warehouse platforms including **Snowflake**, **BigQuery**, **Databricks**, and **Amazon S3**, each offering sophisticated data transformation capabilities. These integrations support multiple sync strategies:

- **Mirror Sync** with Change Data Capture (CDC) for real-time delta updates
- **Append Only Sync** for incremental data loading
- **Full Sync** for complete data refreshes
- **Time-based Import** using monotonically increasing timestamps

Data warehouse integrations require specific authentication mechanisms including service accounts, IAM roles, and personal access tokens, with detailed SQL transformation requirements for handling STRUCT types, JSON properties, and VARIANT data formats.

## Marketing Attribution and Advertising Platforms

The catalog extensively covers marketing attribution through integrations with **AppsFlyer**, **Adjust**, **Branch**, **Kochava**, and **Singular**, all utilizing Amplitude's Attribution API for mobile measurement platform (MMP) data. These integrations enable comprehensive customer acquisition cost (CAC) and return on ad spend (ROAS) calculations.

Advertising platform integrations including **Google Ads**, **Facebook Ads**, **LinkedIn Ads**, **TikTok Ads**, and **X Ads** import campaign-level metrics as "Daily Ad Metrics" events with standardized properties like `ad_metrics.impressions`, `ad_metrics.clicks`, and `ad_metrics.cost`, supporting UTM parameter tracking for attribution analysis.

## Customer Engagement and Marketing Automation

Marketing automation platforms such as **Braze**, **Iterable**, **Leanplum**, **MoEngage**, and **OneSignal** support bidirectional data flow, enabling both event ingestion and cohort export for targeted messaging campaigns across email, SMS, push notifications, and in-app channels.

Customer engagement tools like **Intercom**, **HubSpot**, and **Salesforce** provide comprehensive customer relationship management data, with specialized group-level property mapping for account-based analytics and B2B customer journey tracking.

## Subscription and Revenue Analytics

Subscription management platforms including **RevenueCat**, **Adapty**, **Apphud**, and **Nami** focus on mobile app monetization, streaming subscription events, revenue data, and in-app purchase analytics. **Stripe** integration provides comprehensive revenue event tracking through webhook configuration, supporting payment intent, invoice, and charge events.

## Product Experience and User Onboarding

User experience platforms such as **Userflow**, **Userguiding**, **Chameleon**, **Bento**, and **Candu** track product adoption through onboarding guide events, product tour completions, and feature engagement metrics, enabling analysis of user activation funnels and retention patterns.

## Survey and Feedback Analytics

Qualitative feedback platforms including **Sprig**, **Survicate**, **Qualtrics**, and **Blitzllama** integrate survey response data with behavioral analytics, supporting CSAT, NPS, and custom survey analysis for comprehensive user experience measurement.

## Key Technical Nomenclature

**API Key Authentication** serves as the primary authentication method across most integrations, requiring Amplitude project API keys for data ingestion authorization.

**User ID Mapping** ensures proper user identification across platforms, with specific requirements for `user_id`, `device_id`, and platform-specific identifiers like `amplitudeUserId` and `amplitudeDeviceId`.

**Insert ID Deduplication** prevents duplicate event ingestion through unique event identifiers, particularly important for webhook-based integrations.

**Event Properties and User Properties** follow Amplitude's HTTP V2 API specification, supporting JSON formatting and nested object structures for comprehensive event metadata.

**UTM Parameter Tracking** enables marketing attribution across advertising platforms, with automatic population of `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`, `utm_content`, and `utm_term` parameters.

## Integration Management and Monitoring

The source catalog provides comprehensive monitoring through **Ingestion Jobs** tracking, **Data Sources** management interfaces, and **Schema Enforcement** capabilities. Many integrations support **Partner-Maintained** status, indicating external platform responsibility for integration maintenance and updates.

**EU Data Residency** support ensures compliance with regional data requirements, with specific endpoint configurations for European data processing requirements across multiple integrations.

The ecosystem enables sophisticated cross-platform analytics by unifying behavioral data, marketing attribution, customer engagement metrics, and revenue analytics into Amplitude's comprehensive product analytics platform, supporting data-driven decision making across the entire customer lifecycle.
