Amplitude's Source Catalog represents a comprehensive ecosystem of data integrations that enable organizations to centralize customer data from diverse platforms into Amplitude's analytics infrastructure. The catalog encompasses over 80 integrations spanning marketing automation, attribution tracking, customer engagement, subscription management, data warehouses, and experimentation platforms.

## Core Integration Architecture

The source catalog operates through four primary integration types:

**Raw Events Integration** forms the foundation, ingesting event data directly into Amplitude's event stream. This includes behavioral events from platforms like Braze, Intercom, and OneSignal, subscription events from RevenueCat and Adapty, survey responses from Sprig and Qualtrics, and onboarding events from Userflow and Bento.

**Event Streaming Integration** enables bidirectional data flow, allowing platforms like Segment, mParticle, and Tealium to both send data to Amplitude and receive behavioral cohorts for activation campaigns.

**Cohorts Integration** supports exporting Amplitude's behavioral segments to external platforms for targeted marketing, personalization, and customer engagement across tools like HubSpot, Mailchimp, and Split.

**Attribution Integration** leverages Amplitude's Attribution API to ingest marketing attribution data from mobile measurement platforms including AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch, and Kochava, enabling comprehensive marketing performance analysis.

## Data Warehouse and ETL Ecosystem

The catalog features robust data warehouse integrations supporting both ingestion and export workflows. **Snowflake integration** provides the most comprehensive capabilities with Change Data Capture (CDC), Mirror Sync operations supporting INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations, and multiple import strategies (Full Sync, Timestamp-based, Append Only). **BigQuery integration** enables GA4 data imports through BigQuery linking with specialized handling for STRUCT types and JSON property transformations. **Databricks integration** utilizes Change Data Feed (CDF) for delta sync operations with Unity Catalog permissions.

Cloud storage integrations include **Amazon S3 Import** and **Google Cloud Storage** with converter configuration supporting guided UI or JSON rules, date prefix organization requirements (YYYY/MM/DD/HH), and support for JSON/CSV/parquet formats. Reverse ETL platforms like **Census** and **Hightouch** enable operational analytics by syncing warehouse data back to Amplitude.

## Marketing and Attribution Platform Integration

The catalog extensively covers marketing technology with specialized integrations for major advertising platforms. **Facebook Ads**, **Google Ads**, **LinkedIn Ads**, **TikTok Ads**, and **X Ads** integrations import campaign-level metrics as "Daily Ad Metrics" events with standardized properties like `ad_metrics.impressions`, `ad_metrics.clicks`, `ad_metrics.cost`, `campaign_id`, and UTM parameter mapping for CAC/ROAS calculations.

Mobile attribution platforms utilize Amplitude's Attribution API with specific requirements for Advertising ID (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) matching and 72-hour attribution windows. **AppsFlyer**, **Adjust**, **Branch**, and **Kochava** integrations support real-time attribution data with considerations for SRN restrictions and advertising ID privacy stripping.

## Customer Engagement and Communication Platforms

Email and messaging platform integrations focus on campaign performance tracking. **HubSpot** imports 10 specific email event types (EMAIL_SENT, EMAIL_DELIVERED, EMAIL_OPEN, EMAIL_CLICK) with OAuth authentication and hourly syncing. **SendGrid** utilizes Event Webhook configuration with region-specific endpoints and unique_arg parameters for user ID mapping. **Mailchimp** supports subscribe/unsubscribe events with audience ID requirements.

Multi-channel engagement platforms like **Braze**, **Iterable**, **MoEngage**, and **OneSignal** provide comprehensive event streaming across email, SMS, push notifications, and in-app messaging channels with bidirectional cohort sharing capabilities.

## Subscription and Revenue Analytics

Subscription management integrations enable comprehensive revenue analytics. **RevenueCat** tracks mobile app subscription events with cross-platform support and proceeds vs revenue reporting options. **Adapty** streams subscription monetization events requiring `amplitudeDeviceId` mapping and `customerUserId` synchronization. **Stripe** imports revenue events via webhooks supporting `payment_intent.succeeded`, `charge.succeeded`, and `invoice.payment_succeeded` events with currency normalization.

## Experimentation and Product Analytics

Experimentation platform integrations support A/B testing analysis. **Optimizely** integration uses custom JSON analytics configuration with `track_layer_decision` function and `amplitude.getInstance()` method calls for experiment variation bucketing. **Split** imports feature flag traffic impression data as `get_treatment` events with traffic type mapping. **Taplytics** exports mobile A/B testing data as `TL_experiments` events through the Attribution API.

## Key Technical Nomenclature

**Integration Categories** include marketing-automation, attribution, subscription-management, customer-engagement, collaboration, experimentation, privacy, website, qualitative-feedback, and CDP (Customer Data Platform).

**Authentication Methods** span API key configuration, OAuth flows, service account permissions, personal access tokens (PAT), and webhook configurations with region-specific endpoints for US/EU data residency.

**Data Mapping Requirements** include user ID synchronization between platforms, device ID mapping for mobile attribution, insert_id deduplication, and event property transformation with JSON formatting for complex data structures.

**Sync Strategies** encompass real-time streaming, hourly/daily batch imports, Mirror Sync with CDC capabilities, Append Only operations, and timestamp-based incremental updates with configurable data freshness delays.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

The catalog utilizes several core Amplitude APIs:
- **HTTP V2 API** for event ingestion with batch upload capabilities
- **Attribution API** for marketing attribution data with real-time processing
- **Lookup Table API** for CSV data import and property enrichment
- **User Privacy API** for GDPR compliance and data deletion

Common endpoint patterns include region-specific URLs (api.amplitude.com vs api.eu.amplitude.com), webhook configurations with unique identifiers, and SDK-based integrations requiring specific initialization sequences and user identification methods.

The source catalog represents Amplitude's comprehensive approach to data unification, enabling organizations to create complete customer data foundations while maintaining flexibility for diverse technical architectures and business requirements across the modern data stack.
