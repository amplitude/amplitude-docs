Amplitude's Source Catalog represents a comprehensive ecosystem of data integrations that enable organizations to centralize customer behavior analytics by ingesting data from diverse platforms and tools. The catalog encompasses over 80 integrations spanning marketing automation, attribution tracking, customer engagement, subscription management, data warehouses, and analytics platforms.

## Core Integration Architecture

The source catalog operates on several fundamental integration types that define how data flows into Amplitude:

**Raw Events Integration** serves as the primary mechanism for streaming behavioral data directly into Amplitude as structured events. This integration type preserves the original event structure while mapping essential fields like user_id, device_id, and event_properties to Amplitude's schema.

**Event Streaming Integration** enables real-time data synchronization between platforms, often supporting bidirectional data flow where Amplitude can both receive events and export behavioral cohorts back to source platforms.

**Cohorts Integration** facilitates the export of Amplitude's behavioral segments to external platforms for targeted marketing campaigns, personalization, and customer engagement workflows.

**Attribution Integration** leverages Amplitude's Attribution API to process marketing attribution data, typically with specific requirements for advertising ID matching (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) and attribution windows (commonly 72 hours).

## Data Warehouse and ETL Ecosystem

The catalog includes sophisticated warehouse integrations supporting multiple import strategies:

**Snowflake Integration** provides comprehensive data warehouse connectivity with Change Data Capture (CDC) capabilities, supporting Mirror Sync, Append Only Sync, Timestamp, and Full Sync strategies. The integration handles VARIANT JSON data types for event properties and requires specific SQL transformations using functions like OBJECT_CONSTRUCT and EPOCH_MILLISECOND extraction.

**BigQuery Integration** enables direct import from Google's data warehouse through GCS bucket offloading, requiring Service Account permissions including BigQuery Job User, BigQuery Data Viewer, and Storage Admin roles. The integration handles STRUCT type columns and RECORD type REPEATED mode data with JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR transformations.

**Databricks Integration** utilizes Change Data Feed (CDF) for delta sync operations, requiring all-purpose compute clusters and personal access tokens with Unity Catalog permissions for seamless data synchronization.

**Amazon S3 Import** supports flexible file ingestion with converter configuration options, handling JSON, CSV, and Parquet formats with date prefix organization (YYYY/MM/DD/HH) and file size requirements between 1MB-1GB.

## Marketing and Attribution Platform Integration

The catalog extensively covers marketing attribution and advertising platforms:

**Facebook Ads, Google Ads, LinkedIn Ads, TikTok Ads, and X Ads** integrations import campaign-level metrics as "Daily Ad Metrics" events with standardized properties including ad_metrics.impressions, ad_metrics.clicks, ad_metrics.cost, campaign_id, and ad_group_id. These integrations support UTM parameter mapping for Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) calculations.

**Attribution platforms** like AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch, Kochava, and Singular utilize Amplitude's Attribution API for real-time mobile attribution data with specific requirements for advertising ID matching and attribution window handling.

## Customer Engagement and Marketing Automation

The ecosystem includes comprehensive customer engagement platform integrations:

**Email Marketing Platforms** such as Braze, HubSpot, Iterable, Mailchimp, and SendGrid stream email campaign events including EMAIL_SENT, EMAIL_DELIVERED, EMAIL_OPEN, and EMAIL_CLICK events with configurable sync intervals and OAuth authentication.

**Customer Engagement Platforms** like Intercom, OneSignal, and MoEngage support bidirectional data flow, enabling both event ingestion and cohort export for targeted messaging campaigns across push notifications, email, SMS, and in-app channels.

## Subscription and Revenue Analytics

**Subscription Management Platforms** including Adapty, RevenueCat, Apphud, and Nami specialize in mobile app monetization, streaming subscription events, in-app purchase data, and revenue analytics with user ID synchronization requirements.

**Revenue Tracking** through Stripe integration imports payment events like payment_intent.succeeded, charge.succeeded, and invoice.payment_succeeded with webhook configuration and currency normalization capabilities.

## Product Analytics and User Experience

**Product Experience Platforms** such as Chameleon, Userflow, Userguiding, Bento, and Candu track user onboarding, product tours, and feature adoption with events like Flow Started, Checklist Task Completed, and step completion tracking.

**Survey and Feedback Platforms** including Sprig, Survicate, Qualtrics, and Blitzllama capture qualitative feedback data through CSAT, NPS, and custom survey responses, enabling correlation analysis between satisfaction metrics and behavioral data.

## Key Technical Nomenclature

**User ID Mapping** represents the critical process of aligning user identifiers across platforms, often requiring configuration of amplitudeUserId, customerUserId, or email-based matching.

**Device ID Synchronization** ensures consistent device tracking across platforms, particularly important for mobile attribution with advertising IDs (IDFA/IDFV/ADID).

**Event Properties Transformation** involves mapping platform-specific data structures to Amplitude's schema, often requiring JSON transformations and field restructuring.

**Insert ID Deduplication** prevents duplicate event ingestion through unique identifier management across data sources.

**Schema Enforcement** ensures data consistency and validation across integrated platforms, particularly relevant for warehouse integrations.

## API Endpoints and Authentication

The catalog utilizes several key API endpoints:

- **Amplitude Attribution API** for attribution data ingestion
- **HTTP V2 API** for standard event ingestion
- **Batch Upload API** for high-volume data imports
- **User Privacy API** for data compliance and user deletion

Authentication mechanisms include API key configuration, OAuth flows, service account permissions, and webhook authentication tokens, with specific regional considerations for US and EU data centers.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The source catalog integrates seamlessly with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem, supporting Portfolio-level configurations, behavioral cohort creation, funnel analysis, retention tracking, and advanced segmentation. The integrations enable comprehensive customer journey analysis by combining quantitative behavioral data with qualitative feedback, attribution insights, and revenue metrics, creating a unified view of customer experience across all touchpoints.
