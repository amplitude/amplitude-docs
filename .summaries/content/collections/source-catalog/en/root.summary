Amplitude's Source Catalog represents a comprehensive ecosystem of data integrations that enables organizations to centralize behavioral analytics by ingesting data from diverse platforms and tools. The catalog encompasses over 60 integrations spanning marketing automation, attribution tracking, customer engagement, subscription management, data warehouses, and experimentation platforms.

## Core Integration Architecture

The source catalog operates on several fundamental integration types that define how data flows into Amplitude:

**Raw-Events Integration** serves as the primary mechanism for ingesting event data directly into Amplitude projects, transforming external platform events into Amplitude's event schema. This integration type supports real-time data streaming and batch processing, enabling comprehensive behavioral analysis across platforms.

**Event-Streaming Integration** facilitates bidirectional data flow, allowing both data ingestion into Amplitude and data export to external platforms. This creates closed-loop analytics workflows where insights generated in Amplitude can trigger actions in connected systems.

**Cohorts Integration** enables behavioral segment sharing between Amplitude and external platforms, allowing organizations to leverage Amplitude's advanced segmentation capabilities for targeted campaigns and personalized experiences across their technology stack.

**Attribution Integration** utilizes Amplitude's Attribution API to ingest marketing attribution data, typically with specific requirements for advertising ID matching (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) and attribution windows (commonly 72 hours).

## Data Warehouse and ETL Ecosystem

The catalog includes robust support for modern data infrastructure through integrations with major cloud data warehouses including Snowflake, BigQuery, and Databricks. These integrations support multiple import strategies:

**Mirror Sync** enables real-time data synchronization using Change Data Capture (CDC) mechanisms, supporting INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations for maintaining data consistency between warehouses and Amplitude.

**Append Only Sync** provides efficient batch processing for append-only data patterns, optimizing for high-volume event ingestion scenarios.

**Time-based Import** leverages monotonically increasing timestamps for incremental data processing, reducing computational overhead and enabling near real-time analytics.

The warehouse integrations require specific technical configurations including service account permissions (BigQuery Job User, BigQuery Data Viewer, Storage Admin), IAM roles, and SQL transformation capabilities for mapping warehouse schemas to Amplitude's event structure.

## Marketing and Attribution Platform Integration

The catalog extensively covers marketing technology stack integration, supporting major attribution platforms including AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch, Kochava, and Singular. These integrations typically utilize the Attribution API endpoint and require advertising ID matching for mobile attribution tracking.

Email marketing platforms like HubSpot, Mailchimp, SendGrid, and Braze integrate through webhook configurations, streaming email engagement events (opens, clicks, deliveries) with specific event naming conventions (often prefixed with platform identifiers like "[Mailchimp]" or "[Sendgrid]").

Social media advertising platforms including Facebook Ads and Google Ads import campaign-level metrics as "Daily Ad Metrics" events, providing properties like ad_metrics.impressions, ad_metrics.clicks, and ad_metrics.cost for CAC/ROAS calculations without user-level identity mapping.

## Customer Engagement and Experience Platforms

The catalog includes comprehensive support for customer engagement platforms that track user interactions across touchpoints. Platforms like Intercom, OneSignal, and MoEngage provide bidirectional integration supporting both event ingestion and cohort export for targeted messaging campaigns.

User onboarding and product experience platforms including Chameleon, Userflow, Userguiding, and Bento stream product tour events, step completion tracking, and guide engagement metrics, enabling analysis of onboarding funnel performance and user activation patterns.

Survey and feedback platforms like Qualtrics, Sprig, and Survicate integrate qualitative feedback data through survey response events, supporting CSAT, NPS, and custom survey analysis alongside quantitative behavioral metrics.

## Subscription and Revenue Analytics

Revenue-focused integrations include subscription management platforms like RevenueCat, Adapty, Apphud, and Nami, which stream subscription events, in-app purchase data, and monetization metrics. These integrations require careful user ID mapping between platforms to ensure accurate revenue attribution.

The Stripe integration provides comprehensive revenue event tracking through webhook configuration, supporting events like payment_intent.succeeded, charge.succeeded, and invoice.payment_succeeded with currency normalization and user ID mapping through amplitude_id metadata.

## Experimentation and Feature Management

The catalog supports experimentation platforms including Optimizely, Split, and Taplytics, enabling analysis of feature flag performance and A/B test results. These integrations typically send experiment variation data through identify calls or custom events, allowing correlation between feature exposure and behavioral outcomes.

Split's integration specifically imports traffic impression data as get_treatment events, while Optimizely uses custom JSON analytics integration for syncing behavioral cohorts and experiment bucketing information.

## Technical Implementation Patterns

Most integrations follow consistent authentication patterns using Amplitude project API keys, with regional endpoint support for US (api.amplitude.com) and EU (api.eu.amplitude.com) data residency requirements. Many integrations require user ID mapping configuration to ensure proper identity resolution between platforms.

Event naming conventions typically include platform prefixes (e.g., "[Intercom]", "[Mailchimp]") to distinguish source systems, while maintaining Amplitude's standard event property structure for consistent analysis across data sources.

The catalog supports both partner-maintained and Amplitude-maintained integrations, with partner-maintained integrations often requiring coordination with Customer Success Managers or account managers for feature enablement and configuration.

## Data Governance and Privacy

Several integrations address privacy and data governance requirements, including MetaRouter for first-party data streaming and server-side transformation. The catalog supports various data residency requirements with EU-specific endpoints and configurations for GDPR compliance.

Attribution integrations include privacy considerations for advertising ID handling, with automatic data stripping when advertising IDs are unavailable due to privacy restrictions like iOS 14.5+ App Tracking Transparency requirements.

This comprehensive source catalog enables organizations to create unified customer data platforms where Amplitude serves as the central analytics hub, ingesting behavioral data from across the customer journey while maintaining data quality, privacy compliance, and analytical consistency.
