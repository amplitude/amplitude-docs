## Amplitude Source Catalog - HubSpot Integration

The Amplitude Source Catalog provides comprehensive integration capabilities between Amplitude's product analytics platform and HubSpot's customer relationship management (CRM) and marketing automation platform. This integration enables organizations to implement product-led growth (PLG) strategies by bridging the gap between product usage data and customer relationship management.

## Core Integration Features and Relationships

The HubSpot integration operates through multiple interconnected components that create a bidirectional data flow between Amplitude and HubSpot:

**Data Collection and Tracking**: The integration begins with implementing Amplitude's tracking infrastructure within HubSpot environments, including the installation of Amplitude tracking code on HubSpot CMS pages. This enables comprehensive data capture through Autocapture functionality and Session Replay capabilities, providing detailed insights into user behavior across HubSpot-hosted properties.

**Cohort Synchronization**: A critical feature that enables the transfer of behavioral cohorts from Amplitude to HubSpot, allowing marketing and sales teams to leverage product usage patterns for targeted campaigns and personalized outreach. These behavioral cohorts serve as the foundation for automated workflow enrollment triggers within HubSpot's marketing automation system.

**Product-Qualified Lead (PQL) Scoring**: The integration facilitates sophisticated lead scoring mechanisms that incorporate product usage data from Amplitude into HubSpot's lead scoring tools. This creates a more comprehensive view of lead quality based on actual product engagement rather than traditional demographic or firmographic data alone.

**Visualization and Reporting**: Amplitude charts can be embedded directly into HubSpot dashboards, providing sales and marketing teams with real-time access to product analytics without requiring separate platform access.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Product-Qualified Lead (PQL)**: A lead classification system that identifies prospects based on their product usage behavior and engagement patterns, as opposed to traditional marketing-qualified leads (MQLs) that rely primarily on demographic and engagement scoring.

**Behavioral Cohorts**: User segments created in Amplitude based on specific product usage patterns, behaviors, or engagement criteria that can be synchronized to HubSpot for targeted marketing and sales activities.

**Cohort Sync**: The automated process of transferring user segments from Amplitude to HubSpot, enabling cross-platform audience targeting and workflow automation.

**Workflow Enrollment Triggers**: HubSpot automation rules that initiate specific marketing or sales sequences based on cohort membership or behavioral criteria imported from Amplitude.

**Autocapture**: Amplitude's automatic event tracking functionality that captures user interactions without requiring manual event instrumentation.

**Session Replay**: A feature that records user sessions for detailed behavioral analysis and user experience optimization.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Within the broader Amplitude ecosystem, the HubSpot integration represents a critical bridge between product analytics and customer lifecycle management. The integration leverages Amplitude's core analytics capabilities while extending them into the sales and marketing domain through HubSpot's comprehensive CRM and marketing automation features.

The integration is distributed through the HubSpot App Marketplace, indicating its status as a certified and supported integration within HubSpot's partner ecosystem. This positioning enables organizations to implement product-led growth strategies by creating automated workflows that respond to product usage patterns, ultimately aligning product engagement with sales and marketing activities.

The bidirectional nature of this integration allows for a complete customer journey view, where product usage data informs marketing and sales strategies, while CRM data provides context for product analytics and user behavior analysis. This creates a unified approach to customer success that spans the entire customer lifecycle from initial product engagement through ongoing relationship management.
