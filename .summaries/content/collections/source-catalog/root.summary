Amplitude's Source Catalog is a comprehensive data integration platform that enables organizations to import customer data from various external sources into Amplitude's analytics ecosystem. The catalog serves as a centralized hub for connecting marketing automation platforms, enterprise data warehouses, and other business-critical systems to Amplitude's behavioral analytics engine.

## Product Relationships and Features

The Source Catalog functions as a bidirectional integration layer within Amplitude's product suite, supporting both data ingestion and export capabilities. The platform currently features two primary integration pathways:

The HubSpot integration creates a seamless connection between CRM and marketing automation data with Amplitude's behavioral analytics. This integration supports data flow in both directions - importing contact, company, and engagement data from HubSpot while enabling export of Amplitude cohorts and chart visualizations back to HubSpot workflows and dashboards.

The Snowflake integration focuses on enterprise-scale data warehouse connectivity, enabling organizations to import large volumes of structured data into Amplitude's event processing pipeline. This integration supports sophisticated data transformation and mapping capabilities to accommodate complex enterprise data architectures.

Both integrations leverage Amplitude's core analytics features including Session Replay, Autocapture, behavioral cohort analysis, and user journey tracking to enhance downstream marketing and product workflows.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Import Strategies** define four distinct synchronization methodologies for data warehouse integration:
- **Full Sync**: Complete dataset refresh during each import cycle
- **Timestamp Sync**: Incremental imports based on timestamp field comparisons
- **Append Only Sync**: Continuous addition of new records without modification of existing data
- **Mirror Sync**: Real-time synchronization utilizing Change Data Capture (CDC) technology

**Product-Qualified Lead (PQL)** represents a lead scoring methodology that leverages behavioral data from Amplitude to identify prospects based on actual product usage patterns rather than traditional demographic or firmographic criteria.

**Cohort Sync** describes the process of exporting user segments from Amplitude to external platforms for targeted marketing campaigns and automated workflow triggers.

**Change Data Capture (CDC)** refers to real-time data replication technology that captures and propagates incremental data changes from source systems to Amplitude's analytics platform.

**Key Pair Authentication** denotes RSA-based authentication methodology for secure Snowflake connections, replacing password-based authentication methods (deprecated November 2025).

## Ecosystem Integration

The Source Catalog operates as a foundational component within Amplitude's broader product ecosystem, serving as the primary data ingestion layer that feeds Amplitude's event processing pipeline. Data imported through the catalog integrates with Amplitude's user segmentation engine, visualization layer, and behavioral analytics capabilities.

The HubSpot integration enables product-led growth strategies by combining traditional CRM data with behavioral insights, supporting advanced lead scoring and marketing automation workflows. The Snowflake integration accommodates enterprise data architecture requirements, allowing organizations to leverage existing data warehouse investments while accessing Amplitude's advanced analytics capabilities.

Imported data flows through Amplitude's event processing engine, supporting downstream features including user journey analysis, retention tracking, conversion optimization, and cohort-based segmentation for marketing automation.
