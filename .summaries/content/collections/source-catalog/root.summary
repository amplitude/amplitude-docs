Amplitude's Source Catalog is a comprehensive data integration ecosystem that enables organizations to centralize behavioral analytics by connecting over 60 different platforms and services to Amplitude's analytics platform. The catalog serves as the primary gateway for external data ingestion, supporting diverse integration patterns from real-time event streaming to batch data synchronization across marketing, product, revenue, and infrastructure platforms.

## Core Integration Architecture and Data Flow Patterns

The source catalog operates on three fundamental integration paradigms that define data movement into Amplitude:

**Raw Events Integration** streams behavioral event data directly into Amplitude projects as structured events, supporting both real-time and batch ingestion patterns. This architecture enables platforms like HubSpot, Braze, RevenueCat, and Nami to transmit user interaction data that becomes immediately available for behavioral analysis and segmentation.

**Cohorts Integration** facilitates bidirectional data exchange, allowing Amplitude-generated behavioral cohorts to be exported to external platforms for targeted campaigns while simultaneously importing external segmentation data back into Amplitude. This pattern is extensively implemented across marketing automation platforms including Mailchimp, Leanplum, and OneSignal, creating closed-loop marketing optimization workflows.

**Event Streaming Integration** provides real-time data synchronization specifically designed for attribution and experimentation platforms. Mobile Measurement Platforms (MMPs) like AppsFlyer, Adjust, and Branch utilize Amplitude's Attribution API with specialized user matching algorithms that maintain 72-hour attribution windows for cross-platform user identification through Advertising IDs (IDFA/IDFV/ADID).

## Enterprise Data Warehouse and Cloud Storage Infrastructure

The catalog includes sophisticated enterprise-grade data warehouse integrations supporting massive-scale data ingestion through cloud platforms:

**Snowflake Integration** implements four distinct import strategies: Full Sync, Timestamp-based incremental sync, Append Only Sync, and Mirror Sync. The integration supports Change Data Capture (CDC) through Snowflake streams, enabling delta synchronization for efficient processing of large datasets. Authentication utilizes key pair mechanisms with S3 storage integration for staging data, supporting up to 1 billion events per sync with 12-hour query timeout limits.

**BigQuery Integration** leverages Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket offloading with specific IAM requirements including BigQuery Job User, BigQuery Data Viewer, and Storage Admin permissions. The integration handles STRUCT type columns for complex property mapping and supports both time-based and full sync methods with requirements for monotonically increasing timestamp columns.

**Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage** integrations provide flexible file-based ingestion supporting JSON, CSV, and Parquet formats. These implementations include converter configurations that map external data schemas to Amplitude's HTTP V2 API specification, with continuous file discovery capabilities and optional event notifications for near-real-time processing.

**Databricks Integration** utilizes Change Data Feed functionality for incremental data synchronization, supporting both Unity Catalog and legacy Hive metastore configurations with JDBC connectivity and service principal authentication.

## Marketing Attribution and Advertising Ecosystem

The catalog extensively covers marketing attribution platforms, creating unified customer acquisition analytics:

**Advertising Platform Integrations** with Google Ads, Facebook Ads, LinkedIn Ads, TikTok Ads, and X Ads import campaign-level metrics as standardized "Daily Ad Metrics" events. These events include normalized properties like `ad_metrics.impressions`, `ad_metrics.clicks`, `ad_metrics.cost`, and `ad_metrics.conversions`, enabling Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) calculations through Amplitude's Ad Performance dashboard.

**Mobile Attribution Platforms** including AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch, and Kochava implement specialized Attribution API integrations with user matching algorithms that correlate advertising identifiers across platforms. These integrations maintain attribution event holding windows and support postback configurations for bidirectional attribution data sharing.

**Tag Management Systems** provide both client-side and server-side implementation options through Google Tag Manager templates. These templates support both the legacy Maintenance JavaScript SDK and the modern Browser SDK 2.0, with comprehensive configuration options for autocapture, session tracking, cross-domain attribution, and custom event mapping.

## Customer Engagement and Experience Platform Integration

The catalog encompasses comprehensive customer engagement tools that capture interaction and feedback data:

**Product Onboarding Platforms** including Chameleon, Userguiding, Userflow, and Bento stream product adoption events such as tour completions, step progress, guide engagement metrics, and feature discovery events. These integrations require client-side SDK implementation with user ID matching for behavioral flow analysis.

**Survey and Feedback Platforms** like Qualtrics, Sprig, Survicate, and Blitzllama import qualitative feedback data as structured events with properties for survey responses, satisfaction scores, NPS ratings, and sentiment analysis. The Qualtrics integration supports automatic email-based User_ID mapping and bidirectional cohort sharing for targeted survey distribution.

**Communication and Support Platforms** including Intercom, SendGrid, Mailchimp, and Zendesk provide conversational and email engagement data through OAuth authentication flows and webhook-based event streaming, enabling comprehensive customer communication journey analysis.

## Subscription and Revenue Analytics Integration

Revenue-focused integrations enable comprehensive monetization analytics:

**Subscription Management Platforms** including RevenueCat, Adapty, Apphud, and Nami stream subscription lifecycle events, revenue data, trial conversions, and in-app purchase analytics. These integrations require specific user ID matching between platforms and support revenue recognition events with currency normalization.

**Payment Processing Integration** through Stripe imports revenue events via webhooks, supporting events like `payment_intent.succeeded`, `invoice.payment_succeeded`, and subscription lifecycle changes. User ID mapping occurs through metadata fields with support for both one-time and recurring revenue tracking.

## Key Technical Specifications and Implementation Details

**Authentication Mechanisms** vary by platform but commonly include OAuth 2.0 flows, API key authentication, service account configurations, and webhook verification. Enterprise platforms like Salesforce support both daily and hourly sync schedules with comprehensive schema mapping between external objects and Amplitude group types.

**Data Processing Capabilities** include event deduplication through `insert_id` fields, user property and group property synchronization, complex data transformations through converter configurations, and SQL-based field mapping for schema normalization.

**Regional Data Residency** compliance is supported across integrations with specific endpoints for US and EU regions, ensuring adherence to data governance requirements including GDPR and other regional privacy regulations.

**Rate Limiting and Performance Optimization** implement platform-specific quotas including batch size limits (up to 1 billion events for Snowflake), query timeout limits (12 hours for complex warehouse queries), and event volume quotas for marketing automation platforms to ensure system stability and performance.

**API Endpoints and Technical Integration Points** include Amplitude's HTTP V2 API for event ingestion, Attribution API for mobile attribution matching, Cohort API for audience synchronization, and specialized webhook endpoints for real-time event streaming from platforms like Stripe, Intercom, and various marketing automation tools.

The Source Catalog represents Amplitude's comprehensive approach to creating a unified customer data platform, enabling organizations to consolidate disparate data sources through standardized integration patterns while maintaining flexibility for custom implementation requirements and enterprise-scale data processing capabilities across the entire customer lifecycle from acquisition through retention and monetization.
