## Amplitude Source Catalog: Comprehensive Data Integration Ecosystem

Amplitude's Source Catalog is a comprehensive data integration platform featuring over 60 connectors that enable organizations to centralize behavioral analytics by ingesting data from diverse marketing, engagement, revenue, and infrastructure platforms. The catalog serves as the primary mechanism for unifying customer data across the entire technology stack into Amplitude's behavioral analytics platform.

## Core Integration Architecture and Data Flow Models

The source catalog operates on four fundamental integration patterns that define data ingestion and synchronization:

**Raw-Events Integration** functions as the primary behavioral data ingestion mechanism, capturing user actions, system events, and behavioral data through real-time streaming or batch processing. This integration type maintains complete event fidelity and supports comprehensive behavioral analysis across the customer journey.

**Event-Streaming Integration** enables real-time bidirectional data synchronization, ensuring immediate availability of user actions and system events for cross-platform analysis and activation workflows.

**Cohorts Integration** facilitates bidirectional audience data flow, allowing Amplitude's behavioral segments to be exported for targeted campaigns while importing external segmentation data for enriched behavioral analysis.

**Attribution Integration** leverages Amplitude's Attribution API to capture marketing attribution data with specific requirements for advertising ID matching (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) and configurable attribution windows (typically 72 hours).

## Data Warehouse and Modern Data Stack Integration

The catalog provides extensive support for cloud data infrastructure through native integrations with Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, and Amazon S3. These warehouse integrations support multiple synchronization strategies:

**Mirror Sync** maintains exact data replicas with full CRUD operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) through Change Data Capture (CDC) functionality. **Append Only Sync** focuses on incremental data ingestion without historical record modification. **Full Sync** performs complete data refreshes, while **Timestamp-based Import** enables incremental updates using temporal markers.

Warehouse integrations utilize enterprise-grade authentication including service accounts, Personal Access Tokens (PAT), and JWT authentication. Required permissions include BigQuery Job User, BigQuery Data Viewer, and Storage Admin roles, with support for cross-cloud data residency requirements.

Data transformation capabilities include sophisticated JSON mapping using functions like JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR and OBJECT_CONSTRUCT, support for complex data types including STRUCT and VARIANT JSON, and SQL-based transformation pipelines for data normalization and enrichment.

## Marketing Attribution and Campaign Analytics Platform

The catalog extensively covers marketing attribution through integrations with Facebook Ads, Google Ads, AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch, and Singular. These platforms import campaign performance data as "Daily Ad Metrics" events with standardized properties:

- `ad_metrics.impressions`
- `ad_metrics.clicks` 
- `ad_metrics.cost`
- `campaign_id`
- `ad_group_id`

Attribution integrations require Advertising ID matching and support UTM parameter mapping for comprehensive attribution analysis. The integrations enable calculation of Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), Return on Ad Spend (ROAS), and multi-touch attribution modeling across the marketing funnel.

## Customer Engagement and Communication Platform Ecosystem

A significant portion of the catalog addresses customer engagement through integrations with Braze, HubSpot, Intercom, OneSignal, SendGrid, and Mailchimp. These platforms capture comprehensive communication events including email opens, clicks, SMS interactions, push notification engagement, and in-app messaging activities.

Engagement integrations support bidirectional data flow, enabling both communication event import and behavioral cohort export for targeted messaging campaigns. Events are prefixed with platform identifiers (e.g., "[Intercom]", "[Sendgrid]") for clear source attribution and cross-platform journey analysis.

## Subscription and Revenue Analytics Integration

Specialized revenue tracking integrations include RevenueCat, Adapty, Stripe, Apphud, and Nami, focusing on subscription lifecycle events, in-app purchase tracking, and revenue attribution. These integrations capture critical revenue events:

- `payment_intent.succeeded`
- `charge.succeeded`
- Subscription renewal events
- In-app purchase completions

Revenue integrations require precise user ID mapping between platforms and support subscription funnel analysis, churn prediction modeling, and customer lifetime value calculations.

## Experimentation and Feature Management Platform Integration

The catalog supports experimentation platforms including Optimizely, Split, and Taplytics, importing experiment exposure data, feature flag impressions, and A/B test results. Experiment data is transmitted through identify calls or dedicated events like "TL_experiments" with experiment-to-variation mappings.

Feature flag integrations capture traffic impression data and support behavioral impact analysis of flag treatments, enabling measurement of feature release impact and controlled rollout effectiveness.

## Survey and Qualitative Feedback Platform Integration

Qualitative feedback integration through Qualtrics, Sprig, Survicate, and Blitzllama captures survey responses, CSAT scores, NPS ratings, and structured feedback data with properties including:

- `survey_name`
- `question_id`
- `answer` values
- Response timestamps

These integrations enable correlation analysis between qualitative feedback and quantitative behavioral metrics, supporting satisfaction-based cohort creation and feedback-driven product optimization.

## Authentication and Configuration Architecture

The catalog utilizes diverse authentication mechanisms including API keys, OAuth 2.0 flows, webhook configurations, and service account authentication. Most integrations require Amplitude project API keys and support region-specific endpoints for US and EU data residency compliance.

Configuration patterns include user ID mapping between platforms, device ID synchronization, event property transformation, and custom field mapping through guided configuration interfaces designed for non-technical users.

## Data Processing and Transformation Capabilities

The catalog includes sophisticated data transformation through converter configurations, JSON mapping rules, and SQL-based transformations. File-based integrations support multiple formats including JSON, CSV, and Parquet with compression options and organizational requirements like date prefix formats (YYYY/MM/DD/HH) and file size constraints (1MB-1GB range).

Warehouse integrations handle complex nested data structures and provide real-time data validation and transformation during the ingestion process.

## Integration Management and Operational Monitoring

The source catalog provides comprehensive integration management through Amplitude's Data Sources interface, supporting configuration import/export, sync cadence management (hourly/daily intervals), and integration health monitoring with alerting capabilities.

Integrations are categorized by type (marketing-automation, subscription-management, customer-engagement) and clearly indicate whether they are partner-maintained or Amplitude-maintained, providing transparency around support responsibilities and SLA commitments.

Many enterprise integrations require Customer Success Manager enablement, account manager coordination, or specific plan prerequisites, ensuring proper implementation and ongoing optimization of data integration workflows.

The catalog represents a comprehensive data unification platform that enables organizations to create a complete view of customer behavior across their entire technology stack, supporting advanced behavioral analytics, predictive modeling, and data-driven decision making at enterprise scale.
