## Product Overview

Amplitude's Source Catalog is a comprehensive data integration ecosystem comprising over 80 connectors that enable organizations to centralize customer data from diverse platforms into Amplitude's analytics infrastructure. The catalog spans marketing automation, attribution tracking, customer engagement, subscription management, data warehouses, and experimentation platforms, serving as the foundational layer for unified customer analytics.

## Integration Architecture and Product Relationships

The Source Catalog operates through four distinct integration paradigms that form a cohesive data unification strategy:

**Raw Events Integration** serves as the primary data ingestion mechanism, capturing behavioral events directly into Amplitude's event stream. This includes customer touchpoints from engagement platforms (Braze, Intercom, OneSignal), subscription lifecycle events (RevenueCat, Adapty), qualitative feedback (Sprig, Qualtrics), and user onboarding flows (Userflow, Bento).

**Event Streaming Integration** enables bidirectional data orchestration with Customer Data Platforms (CDPs) like Segment, mParticle, and Tealium. These integrations not only ingest event data but also facilitate cohort activation by exporting behavioral segments back to activation platforms.

**Cohorts Integration** focuses on operationalizing Amplitude's behavioral segmentation by exporting audience segments to marketing automation platforms (HubSpot, Mailchimp), personalization engines, and experimentation tools (Split) for targeted campaign execution.

**Attribution Integration** leverages Amplitude's specialized Attribution API to process marketing attribution data from Mobile Measurement Partners (MMPs) including AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch, and Kochava, enabling comprehensive marketing performance attribution analysis.

## Data Infrastructure and Warehouse Ecosystem

The catalog's data warehouse integrations represent sophisticated ETL/ELT capabilities supporting both ingestion and export workflows:

**Snowflake Integration** provides the most advanced capabilities with Change Data Capture (CDC), Mirror Sync operations supporting INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations, and multiple import strategies including Full Sync, Timestamp-based incremental updates, and Append Only modes.

**BigQuery Integration** specializes in Google Analytics 4 (GA4) data imports through BigQuery linking, with specialized handling for STRUCT data types and JSON property transformations for complex nested data structures.

**Databricks Integration** utilizes Change Data Feed (CDF) for delta sync operations with Unity Catalog permissions, enabling lakehouse architecture integration.

Cloud storage integrations (Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage) support converter configurations through guided UI or JSON rules, requiring date prefix organization (YYYY/MM/DD/HH format) and supporting JSON/CSV/parquet file formats.

Reverse ETL platforms (Census, Hightouch) complete the data activation loop by syncing warehouse data back to Amplitude for operational analytics use cases.

## Marketing Technology and Attribution Platform Integration

The catalog extensively covers marketing technology with standardized integrations for major advertising platforms. Facebook Ads, Google Ads, LinkedIn Ads, TikTok Ads, and X Ads integrations import campaign-level metrics as "Daily Ad Metrics" events with standardized properties including `ad_metrics.impressions`, `ad_metrics.clicks`, `ad_metrics.cost`, `campaign_id`, and UTM parameter mapping for Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) calculations.

Mobile attribution platforms utilize Amplitude's Attribution API with specific requirements for Advertising ID matching (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) and 72-hour attribution windows. These integrations support real-time attribution data processing with considerations for Self-Reporting Network (SRN) restrictions and advertising ID privacy stripping.

## Customer Engagement and Communication Platform Integration

Email and messaging platform integrations focus on campaign performance tracking and customer journey analysis. HubSpot imports 10 specific email event types (EMAIL_SENT, EMAIL_DELIVERED, EMAIL_OPEN, EMAIL_CLICK) with OAuth authentication and hourly synchronization. SendGrid utilizes Event Webhook configuration with region-specific endpoints and unique_arg parameters for user ID mapping.

Multi-channel engagement platforms (Braze, Iterable, MoEngage, OneSignal) provide comprehensive event streaming across email, SMS, push notifications, and in-app messaging channels with bidirectional cohort sharing capabilities for closed-loop marketing optimization.

## Subscription and Revenue Analytics Integration

Subscription management integrations enable comprehensive revenue analytics and monetization tracking. RevenueCat tracks mobile app subscription events with cross-platform support and configurable proceeds versus revenue reporting. Adapty streams subscription monetization events requiring `amplitudeDeviceId` mapping and `customerUserId` synchronization for accurate user attribution.

Stripe integration imports revenue events via webhooks supporting `payment_intent.succeeded`, `charge.succeeded`, and `invoice.payment_succeeded` events with currency normalization for global revenue analysis.

## Experimentation and Feature Flag Integration

Experimentation platform integrations support A/B testing and feature flag analysis. Optimizely integration uses custom JSON analytics configuration with `track_layer_decision` function and `amplitude.getInstance()` method calls for experiment variation bucketing. Split imports feature flag traffic impression data as `get_treatment` events with traffic type mapping for feature adoption analysis.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Integration Categories**: marketing-automation, attribution, subscription-management, customer-engagement, collaboration, experimentation, privacy, website, qualitative-feedback, and CDP (Customer Data Platform)

**Authentication Methods**: API key configuration, OAuth flows, service account permissions, Personal Access Tokens (PAT), and webhook configurations with region-specific endpoints for US/EU data residency compliance

**Data Mapping Requirements**: User ID synchronization between platforms, device ID mapping for mobile attribution, insert_id deduplication for event uniqueness, and event property transformation with JSON formatting for complex data structures

**Sync Strategies**: Real-time streaming, hourly/daily batch imports, Mirror Sync with Change Data Capture (CDC) capabilities, Append Only operations, and timestamp-based incremental updates with configurable data freshness delays

**Mirror Sync**: Advanced synchronization capability supporting INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations for maintaining data consistency between source systems and Amplitude

**Change Data Capture (CDC)**: Technology enabling real-time data synchronization by capturing and processing data changes as they occur in source systems

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

The Source Catalog utilizes several core Amplitude APIs:

- **HTTP V2 API** (`api.amplitude.com/2/httpapi` or `api.eu.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`) for event ingestion with batch upload capabilities
- **Attribution API** for marketing attribution data with real-time processing requirements
- **Lookup Table API** for CSV data import and property enrichment functionality
- **User Privacy API** for GDPR compliance and data deletion requests

Common implementation patterns include region-specific URLs for data residency compliance, webhook configurations with unique identifiers for event routing, and SDK-based integrations requiring specific initialization sequences with proper user identification methods.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The Source Catalog serves as the foundational data ingestion layer within Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem, feeding data into Amplitude Analytics for behavioral analysis, Amplitude Experiment for A/B testing, and Amplitude Audiences for segmentation and activation. The catalog's bidirectional integration capabilities enable closed-loop marketing optimization by allowing behavioral insights to flow back to activation platforms for campaign personalization and optimization.

The catalog represents Amplitude's comprehensive approach to solving the customer data unification challenge, enabling organizations to create complete customer data foundations while maintaining flexibility for diverse technical architectures and business requirements across the modern data stack.
