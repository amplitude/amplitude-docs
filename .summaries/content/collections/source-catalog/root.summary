## Product Overview

Amplitude's Source Catalog is a comprehensive data integration ecosystem that centralizes behavioral analytics by ingesting data from over 60 diverse platforms and tools. The catalog spans marketing automation, attribution tracking, customer engagement, subscription management, data warehouses, and experimentation platforms, positioning Amplitude as the central hub for unified customer journey analytics and behavioral insights.

## Integration Architecture and Product Relationships

The Source Catalog operates on four primary integration patterns that define data flow relationships:

**Raw-Events Integration** serves as the foundational ingestion method, streaming behavioral event data directly into Amplitude's analytics platform from sources like Braze, Intercom, HubSpot, and mobile attribution providers for real-time tracking.

**Event-Streaming Integration** enables bidirectional data flow, supporting both ingestion and export capabilities through platforms like Segment, AppsFlyer, and Branch for comprehensive cross-platform analytics orchestration.

**Cohorts Integration** facilitates audience segmentation workflows by importing user segments and exporting Amplitude behavioral cohorts to external platforms for targeted campaigns and personalization engines.

**Attribution Integration** leverages Amplitude's Attribution API to process mobile attribution data from providers like Adjust, AppsFlyer, and Singular, supporting advertising ID matching (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) with 72-hour attribution windows.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Change Data Capture (CDC)** - Real-time data synchronization method that captures and processes database changes as they occur, primarily used in Snowflake integrations.

**Mirror Sync** - Comprehensive synchronization strategy supporting insert, update, and delete operations to maintain exact data replicas between source and destination systems.

**Append Only Sync** - Data ingestion pattern that only adds new records without modifying existing data, optimized for event-stream architectures.

**Self-Reporting Networks (SRN)** - Attribution networks that report their own conversion data directly to measurement platforms, requiring specific privacy and validation considerations.

**Advertising ID Matching** - Identity resolution process using device identifiers (IDFA for iOS, ADID for Android, IDFV for iOS vendor-specific) to connect attribution events with user behavioral data.

**Event Prefixes** - Standardized naming conventions like "[HubSpot]", "[Sendgrid]", or "[Braze]" that categorize events by source platform for easy identification and filtering.

**User Identity Mapping** - Configuration process that aligns various identifier types (user_id, device_id, email, amplitudeDeviceId, customerUserId) across platforms for unified user journey tracking.

## Data Warehouse and ETL Ecosystem

The catalog's warehouse integrations represent sophisticated ETL capabilities:

**Snowflake Integration** provides the most comprehensive connectivity with Change Data Capture, Mirror Sync operations, Timestamp-based imports, and Full Sync strategies. It supports key pair authentication, S3 Storage Integration, and handles VARIANT JSON data types with OBJECT_CONSTRUCT functions.

**BigQuery Integration** enables GA4 data imports through BigQuery linking, requiring GCS bucket configuration and Service Account permissions (BigQuery Job User, BigQuery Data Viewer, Storage Admin). It processes STRUCT type columns and supports JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR transformations.

**Databricks Integration** utilizes Change Data Feed (CDF) for delta sync operations with Unity Catalog permissions and all-purpose compute clusters.

**Cloud Storage Integrations** (Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage) provide file-based ingestion supporting JSON/CSV/parquet formats with converter configuration and IAM role setup.

## Marketing Attribution and Campaign Analytics

The catalog extensively covers marketing attribution workflows:

**Mobile Attribution Providers** (AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch, Kochava, Singular) integrate via the Attribution API for real-time attribution tracking with advertising ID matching capabilities.

**Advertising Platforms** (Facebook Ads, Google Ads) import campaign-level metrics as "Daily Ad Metrics" events, including properties like ad_metrics.impressions, ad_metrics.clicks, ad_group_id, and UTM parameter mapping for CAC/ROAS calculations.

**Email and Marketing Automation** platforms (HubSpot, Mailchimp, SendGrid, Braze) stream engagement events (opens, clicks, deliveries) with platform-specific event prefixes.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Source Catalog integrates with Amplitude's broader product ecosystem through several key touchpoints:

**Attribution API** serves as the primary endpoint for mobile attribution data processing, handling advertising ID matching and attribution window calculations.

**Cohorts Export** functionality enables behavioral segments created in Amplitude to activate audiences across external marketing and personalization platforms.

**Impact-Driven Development** workflows connect experimentation platforms (Optimizely, Split, Taplytics) with A/B testing data, experiment variation tracking, and feature flag impression data.

**Revenue Analytics** integrations (RevenueCat, Adapty, Stripe) focus on mobile app monetization and subscription event streaming for comprehensive revenue attribution analysis.

## Technical Implementation Specifications

**Authentication Methods** vary by integration type: OAuth flows (Intercom, HubSpot, Mailchimp), API key authentication, Service Account configurations (warehouse sources), and webhook-based authentication (SendGrid, Stripe).

**Data Delivery Patterns** range from real-time streaming to batch processing: 30-minute delivery intervals, hourly syncing, daily imports for advertising platforms, and real-time webhooks for engagement platforms.

**Regional Compliance** includes EU data residency support for GDPR compliance with specific endpoint configurations (api.eu.amplitude.com) and data center selection options.

**API Endpoints** include the Attribution API for mobile attribution data, various webhook endpoints for real-time event streaming, and platform-specific APIs for OAuth authentication flows and data synchronization operations.

The Source Catalog represents Amplitude's strategy to unify disparate customer data sources into comprehensive behavioral analytics, enabling organizations to build complete customer journey understanding across their entire technology stack.
