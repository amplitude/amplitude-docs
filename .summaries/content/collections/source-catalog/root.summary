# Amplitude Source Catalog Product Overview

## High-Level Overview

The Amplitude Source Catalog is a comprehensive collection of integrations that connects diverse data sources, marketing tools, and product analytics platforms with Amplitude's analytics ecosystem. This solution enables organizations to centralize data collection, enrich user profiles, analyze cross-platform behavior, and activate insights through targeted marketing campaigns.

Key features include data ingestion from multiple sources, bidirectional data flow between platforms, attribution tracking for marketing campaigns, user identification mapping across systems, real-time event streaming, and cohort synchronization for targeted marketing.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Source Catalog integrations are organized into functional categories that form a cohesive data ecosystem:

1. **Data Warehouses & Infrastructure** (Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage)
   - Enables importing structured data directly from data storage systems
   - Supports both raw event data and aggregated metrics

2. **Marketing & Engagement Platforms** (HubSpot, Braze, Intercom, OneSignal, SendGrid, Mailchimp, Iterable)
   - Facilitates bidirectional data flow for campaign analysis
   - Enables audience targeting based on product usage patterns
   - Connects marketing activities with product engagement metrics

3. **Attribution & Advertising** (AppsFlyer, Branch, Adjust, Singular, Facebook Ads, Google Ads)
   - Tracks marketing attribution and advertising performance
   - Links acquisition channels to downstream user behaviors
   - Measures ROI across marketing initiatives

4. **Product Experience & Feedback** (Sprig, Survicate, Userflow, Userguiding, Chameleon, Candu)
   - Collects and analyzes user feedback within the product context
   - Correlates experience data with behavioral analytics

5. **Subscription & Revenue** (RevenueCat, Stripe, Adapty, Nami, Apphud)
   - Tracks monetization metrics and subscription analytics
   - Connects revenue data with user engagement patterns

6. **Implementation Tools** (Google Tag Manager, Segment, Tealium, RudderStack, MetaRouter)
   - Provides flexible data collection implementation options
   - Enables tag management and event standardization

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Raw Events**: The primary data format for importing behavioral data into Amplitude, representing discrete user actions.

2. **Cohorts**: User segments created in Amplitude based on behavior patterns that can be exported to other platforms for targeted actions.

3. **Attribution API**: Amplitude's API specifically designed for receiving attribution data from marketing platforms to connect acquisition with engagement.

4. **User Properties**: Attributes associated with individual users that can be imported or exported between systems (e.g., demographic information, subscription status).

5. **Group Properties**: Attributes associated with account-level or organization-level entities, enabling B2B analytics use cases.

6. **Mirror Sync**: An import strategy that maintains perfect synchronization between Amplitude and the source system, including updates and deletions of records.

7. **Append Only Sync**: An import strategy that exclusively adds new data without modifying existing records, optimized for event-based systems.

8. **API Key**: The authentication credential required for most integrations to securely connect with Amplitude's APIs.

9. **User ID Mapping**: The process of matching user identifiers between Amplitude and integrated platforms to maintain consistent user profiles.

10. **Event Prefixing**: The practice of adding a platform-specific prefix to event names for easy identification of data sources (e.g., "Braze_" for events from Braze).

## Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude Source Catalog serves as a central hub in a company's data infrastructure by:

1. **Unifying the Customer Data Stack**: Connecting disparate tools and platforms to create a single view of the customer journey.

2. **Bridging Marketing and Product Teams**: Enabling marketing teams to leverage product usage data and product teams to understand marketing impact.

3. **Supporting the Full Customer Lifecycle**: Tracking from acquisition through engagement, retention, and monetization across all connected platforms.

4. **Enabling Cross-Platform Analytics**: Analyzing user behavior across web, mobile, and other digital touchpoints through integrated data sources.

5. **Facilitating Closed-Loop Marketing**: Measuring campaign effectiveness by connecting attribution data with downstream product engagement and conversion metrics.

## Integration Setup Patterns and API Endpoints

Most integrations follow standardized setup patterns:

1. **API Key Authentication**: Using Amplitude API keys for secure connections
   - Primary endpoint: `https://api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi` for event ingestion
   - EU data residency endpoint: `https://api.eu.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`

2. **OAuth Flow**: Authorizing connections through secure OAuth processes for platforms supporting this authentication method

3. **Webhook Configuration**: Setting up webhooks to push data from integrated platforms to Amplitude
   - Attribution API endpoint: `https://api.amplitude.com/api/2/attribution`

4. **Data Warehouse Connection**: Configuring SQL queries and authentication credentials for importing data from warehouses

5. **SDK Implementation**: Adding code snippets to applications for client-side integrations with implementation tools

The Source Catalog creates a robust ecosystem that enables businesses to build a unified analytics infrastructure, connecting customer data across marketing, product, and revenue platforms to drive data-informed decision making throughout the organization.
