## Amplitude Source Catalog Product Overview

Amplitude's Source Catalog is a comprehensive data integration ecosystem that enables businesses to centralize customer behavior analytics from over 60 diverse platforms and tools. The catalog serves as the primary data ingestion layer for Amplitude's analytics platform, supporting attribution platforms, marketing automation tools, data warehouses, customer engagement platforms, and specialized analytics services through standardized integration patterns.

## Product Architecture and Integration Relationships

The Source Catalog operates through four distinct integration patterns that define how data flows into Amplitude:

**Raw Events Integration** forms the foundation of the catalog, streaming granular user interaction data directly into Amplitude projects. This pattern preserves behavioral data integrity from platforms like Adapty, Airbridge, Braze, and Google Analytics 4, enabling detailed user journey analysis.

**Cohorts Integration** establishes bidirectional data flow, allowing Amplitude behavioral cohorts to be exported for targeted campaigns while importing external segmentation data. This creates a feedback loop between Amplitude insights and execution platforms like Braze, OneSignal, and Segment.

**Attribution API Integration** specializes in mobile attribution data processing, requiring Advertising ID matching within 72-hour attribution windows. This pattern connects mobile attribution platforms including Adjust, AppsFlyer, and Branch to Amplitude's user identification system.

**Event Streaming** provides real-time data transmission for immediate analytics processing, primarily used by customer engagement platforms and marketing automation tools requiring low-latency data flow.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Daily Ad Metrics Events**: Standardized event format for advertising platform data containing properties like `ad_metrics.impressions`, `ad_metrics.clicks`, and `ad_metrics.cost` for CAC/ROAS calculations across Facebook Ads, Google Ads, LinkedIn Ads, TikTok Ads, and X Ads.

**Full Sync, Mirror Sync, Append Only, CDC**: Data warehouse import strategies where Full Sync replaces entire datasets, Mirror Sync maintains exact replicas, Append Only adds new records chronologically, and Change Data Capture (CDC) tracks incremental changes.

**Attribution Window**: 72-hour period during which mobile attribution platforms hold events for user matching via Advertising IDs (IDFA/IDFV/ADID).

**User Identity Mapping**: Cross-platform user correlation system supporting multiple identifier types including `user_id`, `device_id`, email addresses, `amplitudeUserId`, and `customerUserId`.

**Ingestion Jobs**: Monitoring and tracking system for data import processes across all integration types.

**Converter Configurations**: Data transformation settings for file-based integrations (S3, GCS) that handle format conversion and field mapping.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Source Catalog functions as the primary data ingestion layer within Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem. It connects upstream data sources to downstream Amplitude features including:

**Analytics Processing Engine**: Raw events from the catalog feed into Amplitude's behavioral analytics, funnel analysis, and retention calculations.

**Cohort Management System**: Bidirectional integrations enable cohort-based targeting and campaign optimization through external platforms.

**Revenue Analytics**: Specialized subscription and payment integrations (Stripe, RevenueCat, Adapty) support Amplitude's revenue analytics capabilities.

**Lookup Tables**: CSV data import functionality enriches event properties through the Lookup Table API.

**Data Export Systems**: Integration with warehouse platforms (BigQuery, Snowflake, Databricks) supports both data import and export workflows.
