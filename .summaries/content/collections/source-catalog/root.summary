# Amplitude Source Catalog

## Product Overview

Amplitude Source Catalog is a comprehensive integration hub that connects Amplitude's analytics platform with various third-party tools, services, and data sources. It enables businesses to consolidate user behavior data from multiple touchpoints into a unified analytics platform. The catalog supports importing data into Amplitude, exporting cohorts and analytics to other platforms, and establishing bidirectional data flows between Amplitude and partner services.

The primary value proposition is creating a holistic view of the customer journey across different channels and platforms, allowing product, marketing, and data teams to gain comprehensive insights into user behavior.

## Product Relationships and Features

The Source Catalog organizes integrations into several key categories:

1. **Data Import Integrations**: These connect Amplitude with data warehouses and storage solutions like Snowflake, BigQuery, Google Cloud Storage, Amazon S3, and Databricks. They allow importing historical and batch data into Amplitude for analysis.

2. **Event Streaming Integrations**: These enable real-time data flow from Customer Data Platforms (CDPs) such as Segment, RudderStack, mParticle, and MetaRouter. They ensure that user interactions are immediately available in Amplitude for analysis.

3. **Marketing & Messaging Integrations**: These connect marketing automation and customer messaging platforms like Braze, HubSpot, SendGrid, Mailchimp, OneSignal, and Intercom with Amplitude. They allow for behavioral data to inform marketing campaigns and for campaign performance data to be analyzed in Amplitude.

4. **Attribution & Ad Platform Integrations**: These import attribution and advertising data from platforms such as AppsFlyer, Branch, Adjust, Singular, Facebook Ads, and Google Ads. They help track the effectiveness of marketing campaigns and ad spend.

5. **Subscription & Revenue Integrations**: These track monetization and subscription data from services like RevenueCat, Stripe, Adapty, Apphud, and Nami. They enable revenue analysis alongside behavioral data.

6. **Survey & Feedback Integrations**: These import qualitative feedback data from tools like Sprig, Survicate, Qualtrics, and Blitzllama. They help correlate user sentiment with behavioral patterns.

7. **Product Experience Integrations**: These connect product tour and onboarding tools such as Userflow, Userguiding, Chameleon, Bento, and Candu. They help analyze the effectiveness of in-product guidance.

8. **Data Warehouse & ETL Integrations**: These establish connections with data warehouses and ETL tools like Census, Hightouch, Snowflake, and BigQuery. They support advanced data transformation and movement.

Many integrations support bidirectional data flow, allowing not only data import into Amplitude but also the export of cohorts and insights from Amplitude to other platforms for activation.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Event**: A discrete user action or system occurrence tracked in Amplitude (e.g., page view, button click, purchase)
2. **User Properties**: Attributes associated with individual users (e.g., name, email, subscription plan)
3. **Group Properties**: Attributes associated with organizational units of users (e.g., company, account)
4. **Cohort**: A defined segment of users who share common characteristics or behaviors
5. **API Key**: Authentication credential required to establish secure connections between platforms
6. **Attribution**: The process of identifying which marketing channels and campaigns drive user acquisition
7. **Raw Events**: Unprocessed event data sent to Amplitude before any transformations
8. **User ID**: Primary identifier for users in Amplitude's system
9. **Device ID**: Identifier for specific devices in Amplitude
10. **Advertising ID**: Mobile device identifiers (IDFA for iOS, ADID for Android)
11. **Change Data Capture (CDC)**: Technique for tracking and capturing changes in data sources
12. **Converter Configuration**: Settings that define how data is transformed when imported into Amplitude

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Source Catalog positions Amplitude as a central analytics hub within a broader product ecosystem:

1. **Customer Data Platforms**: Integrations with Segment, mParticle, RudderStack, and Tealium allow Amplitude to receive pre-processed data from multiple sources.

2. **Marketing Technology Stack**: Connections with marketing automation tools (Braze, HubSpot), messaging platforms (Intercom, SendGrid), and ad platforms (Facebook Ads, Google Ads) enable closed-loop marketing analytics.

3. **Data Infrastructure**: Integrations with data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery) and ETL tools position Amplitude as both a data source and destination within the modern data stack.

4. **Product Experience Tools**: Connections with product tour platforms (Userflow, Chameleon) and feedback tools (Sprig, Qualtrics) link qualitative and quantitative user insights.

5. **Revenue Systems**: Integrations with payment processors (Stripe) and subscription management tools (RevenueCat) connect financial metrics with behavioral data.

The ecosystem approach allows businesses to maintain their existing tech stack while centralizing analytics in Amplitude, creating a single source of truth for user behavior across the customer journey.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

The Source Catalog integrations typically interact with Amplitude through several key API endpoints:

1. **HTTP API V2**: Used for sending events to Amplitude
   - Endpoint: `https://api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`
   - EU Endpoint: `https://api.eu.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`

2. **Attribution API**: Used for attribution integrations
   - Endpoint: `https://api.amplitude.com/api/2/attribution`

3. **Identify API**: Used for updating user properties
   - Endpoint: `https://api2.amplitude.com/identify`

4. **Cohort API**: Used for exporting cohorts to third-party platforms

5. **Lookup Table API**: Used for managing lookup tables

Implementation typically involves authentication via API keys, mapping user identities between systems, configuring data field mappings, and establishing sync schedules. For data warehouse integrations, SQL queries are often used to extract and transform data before import into Amplitude.

Import strategies include Mirror Sync (reflecting current state), Append Only Sync (adding new data without modifications), Full Sync (complete replacement), and Time-based Import (importing data within specific timestamp ranges).
