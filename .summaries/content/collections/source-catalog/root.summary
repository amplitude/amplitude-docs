# Amplitude Source Catalog

Amplitude Source Catalog is a comprehensive integration platform that connects Amplitude's product analytics capabilities with external customer relationship management and marketing automation systems. The catalog serves as a bridge between product usage data and customer lifecycle management, enabling organizations to implement sophisticated product-led growth strategies through seamless data synchronization and workflow automation.

## Core Integration Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Source Catalog operates through a multi-layered integration framework that establishes bidirectional data flows between Amplitude and partner platforms. The architecture centers around several interconnected components:

**Data Collection Infrastructure** forms the foundation layer, implementing Amplitude's tracking capabilities within partner environments. This includes deployment of Amplitude tracking code on external platforms and activation of Autocapture functionality for comprehensive behavioral data collection. Session Replay capabilities provide granular user interaction recording for detailed behavioral analysis.

**Cohort Synchronization Engine** enables the transfer of behavioral segments from Amplitude to partner platforms, creating the foundation for cross-platform audience targeting. These behavioral cohorts serve as dynamic user segments that automatically update based on product usage patterns and engagement criteria defined within Amplitude's analytics framework.

**Lead Scoring Integration** incorporates product usage data into partner platform scoring mechanisms, creating Product-Qualified Lead (PQL) classifications that complement traditional demographic and firmographic scoring models. This integration enables more sophisticated lead qualification based on actual product engagement rather than inferred intent signals.

**Visualization and Reporting Layer** embeds Amplitude analytics directly into partner platform dashboards, providing real-time access to product insights without requiring separate platform authentication or navigation.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Product-Qualified Lead (PQL)**: Lead classification methodology that prioritizes prospects based on demonstrated product usage behavior and engagement patterns, representing a shift from traditional marketing-qualified lead (MQL) approaches that rely primarily on demographic and content engagement scoring.

**Behavioral Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments created within Amplitude based on specific product usage patterns, feature adoption rates, or engagement thresholds. These cohorts automatically update as user behavior changes and can be synchronized across integrated platforms for consistent targeting.

**Cohort Sync**: Automated synchronization process that maintains real-time alignment between Amplitude user segments and corresponding audience lists in partner platforms, enabling immediate workflow triggers based on behavioral changes.

**Workflow Enrollment Triggers**: Automated rules within partner platforms that initiate specific marketing sequences, sales outreach, or customer success interventions based on cohort membership or behavioral criteria imported from Amplitude.

**Autocapture**: Amplitude's automatic event tracking system that captures user interactions without requiring manual event instrumentation, providing comprehensive behavioral data collection with minimal implementation overhead.

**Session Replay**: Recording functionality that captures complete user sessions for detailed behavioral analysis, user experience optimization, and customer journey mapping.

## Product Ecosystem Positioning

Within Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem, the Source Catalog represents the primary mechanism for extending product analytics insights into operational business systems. The catalog integrations are distributed through partner marketplaces, indicating certified and supported status within partner ecosystems.

The HubSpot integration specifically demonstrates the catalog's capability to bridge product analytics with comprehensive CRM and marketing automation platforms. This integration enables organizations to create unified customer journey views where product engagement data directly informs sales and marketing strategies, while CRM relationship data provides contextual framework for product analytics interpretation.

The bidirectional data flow architecture ensures that product usage patterns can trigger automated marketing workflows, sales alerts, and customer success interventions, while customer relationship data enhances product analytics with account context, deal stage information, and customer lifecycle positioning.

## Integration Implementation

The Source Catalog integrations typically involve installation through partner platform marketplaces, followed by configuration of data synchronization parameters and workflow automation rules. The HubSpot integration specifically requires Amplitude tracking code deployment on HubSpot CMS pages and configuration of cohort synchronization schedules to maintain real-time audience alignment between platforms.

This architecture enables organizations to implement sophisticated product-led growth strategies by automatically responding to product usage patterns with appropriate sales and marketing interventions, creating a unified approach to customer acquisition, expansion, and retention based on demonstrated product engagement rather than traditional demographic or firmographic criteria.
