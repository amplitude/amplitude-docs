Amplitude's Source Catalog is a comprehensive data integration ecosystem comprising over 70 connectors that enable businesses to centralize customer data from diverse platforms into Amplitude's behavioral analytics infrastructure. The catalog serves as the foundational data ingestion layer for creating unified customer data platforms that combine behavioral analytics, marketing attribution, revenue tracking, and customer engagement data.

## Integration Architecture and Data Flow Patterns

The source catalog operates on four primary integration types that define data flow mechanisms into Amplitude:

**Raw-Events Integration** functions as the core behavioral data streaming mechanism, capturing user actions, system events, and custom tracking data in real-time while maintaining complete event fidelity for comprehensive behavioral analysis.

**Cohorts Integration** enables bidirectional data synchronization, allowing Amplitude to both ingest data and export behavioral cohorts back to source platforms, creating closed-loop marketing optimization and personalized customer experience workflows.

**Attribution Integration** leverages Amplitude's Attribution API to process marketing attribution data, requiring Advertising ID matching (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) and supporting configurable attribution windows (typically 72 hours) for cross-platform user identification.

**Event-Streaming Integration** provides real-time data synchronization capabilities supporting both inbound data ingestion and outbound event streaming for comprehensive customer data pipeline creation.

## Data Warehouse and Enterprise ETL Ecosystem

The catalog includes sophisticated enterprise-grade data warehouse integrations:

**Amazon S3 Import** provides bidirectional synchronization with configurable strategies including Mirror Sync and Append Only modes, utilizing IAM role authentication, converter configuration for property mapping, and supporting multiple file formats (JSON/CSV/parquet) with chronological processing requirements.

**BigQuery Data Import** utilizes Google Cloud Storage bucket offloading with Service Account permissions requiring BigQuery Job User, Data Viewer, and Storage Admin roles. It supports Full Sync and Time-based import strategies with SQL transformation capabilities for handling STRUCT types and JSON properties fields.

**Snowflake Integration** offers four distinct import strategies: Full Sync, Timestamp, Append Only Sync, and Mirror Sync with Change Data Capture (CDC) capabilities. It supports key pair authentication and requires SQL query transformations using functions like OBJECT_CONSTRUCT and EPOCH_MILLISECOND extraction.

**Databricks Integration** leverages Change Data Feed (CDF) for delta sync operations, requiring all-purpose compute clusters, personal access tokens (PAT), and Unity Catalog permissions for comprehensive data warehouse connectivity.

## Marketing Attribution and Advertising Platform Integration

The catalog extensively covers marketing attribution platforms following standardized integration patterns:

**Advertising Platforms** including Facebook Ads, Google Ads, LinkedIn Ads, TikTok Ads, and X Ads import campaign-level metrics as "Daily Ad Metrics" events with standardized properties: `ad_metrics.impressions`, `ad_metrics.clicks`, `ad_metrics.cost`, and `ad_metrics.conversions`. These integrations require UTM parameter configuration for Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) calculations.

**Mobile Attribution Platforms** including AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch, Kochava, and Singular utilize Amplitude's Attribution API for real-time mobile attribution data processing, requiring Advertising ID matching and supporting configurable attribution windows for cross-platform user matching.

## Customer Engagement and Marketing Automation

The catalog encompasses comprehensive customer engagement platform integrations:

**Email Marketing Platforms** such as Mailchimp, SendGrid, and HubSpot import standardized email campaign events (SENT, DELIVERED, OPEN, CLICK, BOUNCE) with user mapping based on email addresses and webhook-based real-time event streaming capabilities.

**Marketing Automation Platforms** including Braze, Iterable, Leanplum, and MoEngage support bidirectional data flow, enabling campaign event ingestion and behavioral cohort export for personalized multi-channel marketing campaigns across email, SMS, push notifications, and in-app messaging.

**Customer Support Platforms** like Intercom synchronize conversational data and customer interaction events using OAuth authentication, supporting multiple event topics including conversation, contact, user, and visitor events.

## Subscription and Revenue Analytics Integration

The catalog provides specialized integrations for subscription and revenue tracking:

**Subscription Management Platforms** including RevenueCat, Adapty, Apphud, and Nami stream subscription monetization events, in-app purchase data, and revenue analytics, requiring user ID matching for comprehensive subscription lifecycle analysis.

**Payment Processing** through Stripe integration imports revenue events via webhooks, supporting events like `payment_intent.succeeded`, `invoice.payment_succeeded`, and `checkout.session.completed` with user ID mapping priority and currency normalization capabilities.

## Product Analytics and User Experience Integration

The catalog encompasses product experience and user onboarding platforms:

**User Onboarding Tools** including Userflow, Userguiding, Bento, and Candu stream product tour events, onboarding guide completion data, and user activation metrics for analyzing onboarding funnel performance and user adoption patterns.

**Survey and Feedback Platforms** including Qualtrics, Sprig, Survicate, and Blitzllama import survey response data, CSAT/NPS scores, and qualitative feedback for correlation analysis between user satisfaction and product behavior.

**Experimentation Platforms** like Optimizely, Split, and Taplytics export A/B testing data, feature flag impressions, and experiment variation assignments for comprehensive experimentation analysis.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Change Data Capture (CDC)**: Real-time data synchronization mechanism that captures and streams database changes for incremental data updates.

**Converter Configuration**: Data transformation layer that maps source platform properties to Amplitude event properties, enabling field mapping and property enrichment.

**Attribution Windows**: Time-based matching periods (commonly 72 hours) used for correlating marketing touchpoints with user conversion events across platforms.

**User Identity Mapping**: Multi-identifier matching system supporting user_id, device_id, email addresses, amplitudeUserId, and customerUserId with priority-based matching logic.

**Cohort Export**: Behavioral audience segmentation capability that exports user groups from Amplitude to external platforms for targeted marketing campaigns.

## Technical Implementation Patterns

**Authentication Methods** include API key configuration, OAuth flows, Service Account setup, and webhook authentication, with many integrations supporting both US and EU data residency requirements.

**Data Processing Modes** vary between real-time streaming for attribution and engagement platforms, and daily batch imports for advertising platforms with specific data latency characteristics.

**API Endpoints and Technical Specifications** include:
- `api.amplitude.com/sendgrid` for SendGrid webhook integration
- `api.amplitude.com/iterable` for Iterable campaign data
- Attribution API endpoints for mobile attribution platforms
- HTTP V2 API for server-side integrations and data warehouse imports

The catalog supports various SDK integrations including JavaScript, iOS, Android, React Native, and Unity SDKs with specific configuration requirements for cross-platform user tracking and session management.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Within Amplitude's broader product ecosystem, the Source Catalog serves as the foundational data ingestion layer that feeds into Amplitude's core analytics platform, enabling comprehensive customer journey analysis, behavioral segmentation, and data-driven decision making. The bidirectional nature of many integrations creates closed-loop optimization workflows where behavioral insights from Amplitude can be operationalized across marketing, product, and customer engagement platforms, establishing a unified customer data platform architecture for enterprise-scale analytics operations.
