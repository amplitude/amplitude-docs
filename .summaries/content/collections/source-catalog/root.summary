## Product Overview

Amplitude's Source Catalog is a comprehensive data integration ecosystem comprising over 70 connectors that centralize customer data from diverse platforms into Amplitude's analytics infrastructure. The catalog enables businesses to unify behavioral data, marketing attribution, revenue metrics, and customer engagement signals across their entire technology stack, creating a foundation for advanced analytics, experimentation, and growth optimization.

## Integration Architecture and Product Relationships

The Source Catalog operates on four core integration types that define data flow patterns:

**Raw-Events Integration** serves as the primary data ingestion mechanism, streaming behavioral events directly into Amplitude's analytics pipeline for real-time user journey analysis and product analytics across mobile, web, and backend systems.

**Cohorts Integration** enables bidirectional data exchange, allowing Amplitude to both ingest user segments and export behavioral cohorts to external platforms for targeted marketing campaigns and personalized user experiences.

**Event-Streaming Integration** provides real-time data synchronization capabilities, particularly valuable for attribution tracking and immediate behavioral response systems across marketing and engagement platforms.

**Attribution Integration** handles specialized marketing attribution data through Amplitude's Attribution API, requiring Advertising ID matching (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) and supporting 72-hour attribution windows for cross-platform user identification.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Mirror Sync vs. Append Only Strategies**: Mirror Sync maintains exact data replication with updates and deletions, while Append Only continuously adds new records without modification of existing data.

**Change Data Capture (CDC)**: Advanced data warehouse functionality that tracks and processes only modified records, optimizing sync performance and reducing computational overhead.

**Attribution API**: Amplitude's specialized endpoint for mobile attribution tracking that requires Advertising ID matching protocols and supports attribution event holding for delayed user matching.

**Daily Ad Metrics Events**: Standardized event format for advertising platform data with consistent properties including `ad_metrics.impressions`, `ad_metrics.clicks`, and `ad_metrics.cost` for unified marketing performance analysis.

**Universal Data Object (UDO)**: Tealium's standardized data layer format that enables consistent data mapping across tag management implementations.

**Traffic Type Mapping**: Split.io's method for aligning feature flag traffic segments with Amplitude user identities for experimentation tracking.

## Data Warehouse and Enterprise Integrations

Enterprise-grade data warehouse connectors form the catalog's backbone, supporting sophisticated data transformation and bulk ingestion:

**Amazon S3 Import** provides bidirectional sync with IAM role authentication, supporting JSON/CSV/parquet formats with configurable converter settings for complex data mapping scenarios.

**BigQuery Data Import** leverages Google Cloud Platform through GCS bucket offloading, requiring specific service account permissions (BigQuery Job User, Data Viewer, Storage Admin) and supporting STRUCT type handling for nested data structures.

**Snowflake Integration** offers the most advanced data warehouse connectivity with four import strategies (Full Sync, Timestamp, Append Only Sync, Mirror Sync), VARIANT JSON data type support, and advanced SQL query transformations.

**Databricks Integration** utilizes Change Data Feed (CDF) for delta sync operations, requiring all-purpose compute clusters and supporting both personal access tokens and service principal authentication methods.

## Marketing Attribution Ecosystem

The catalog extensively covers marketing attribution and advertising platforms:

**Advertising Platform Integrations** (Facebook Ads, Google Ads, LinkedIn Ads, TikTok Ads, X Ads) import campaign-level metrics as standardized "Daily Ad Metrics" events, enabling Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) calculations.

**Mobile Attribution Platforms** (AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch, Kochava, Singular) utilize the Attribution API for real-time mobile attribution tracking with specific Advertising ID matching protocols.

**Marketing Automation Platforms** (Braze, HubSpot, Iterable, Leanplum, SendGrid) provide comprehensive customer engagement tracking through email, SMS, push notification, and in-app messaging events, often supporting bidirectional cohort sharing.

## Customer Data Platform Integrations

Major CDP integrations serve as data aggregation and distribution hubs:

**Segment Integration** provides bidirectional data flow through both Amplitude (Actions) and Classic destinations, supporting client-side bundled integration and complete SDK function mappings (track, identify, screen, alias, group).

**mParticle Integration** enables raw event data ingestion across multiple platforms (Android, iOS, Unity, JavaScript) for consolidated analytics.

**Tealium Integration** offers dual methods through iQ Tag Management (TIQ) and AudienceStream Universal Data Hub with UDO configuration.

## Revenue and Subscription Analytics

Specialized integrations focus on monetization tracking:

**RevenueCat Integration** connects mobile app subscription infrastructure with behavioral analytics for cross-platform subscription lifecycle analysis.

**Stripe Integration** imports revenue events through webhooks, supporting payment_intent.succeeded, invoice.payment_succeeded, and other financial transaction events with user ID mapping.

**Mobile Subscription Platforms** (Adapty, Apphud, Nami) provide specialized in-app purchase and subscription lifecycle tracking for mobile app economy optimization.

## Experimentation and User Experience

**Optimizely Integration** syncs behavioral cohorts and experiment data through custom JSON analytics integration, supporting both Web Experimentation and Feature Experimentation.

**Split Integration** imports feature flag traffic impression data with traffic type mapping for experimentation tracking.

**User Onboarding Platforms** (Userflow, Userguiding, Bento, Chameleon) track product tour completion and user activation events for product-led growth optimization.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Attribution API**: Primary endpoint for mobile attribution data ingestion requiring Advertising ID matching and supporting 72-hour attribution windows.

**Webhook Endpoints**: Various integrations utilize webhook authentication for real-time data streaming, particularly for revenue platforms like Stripe and engagement platforms.

**OAuth Flows**: Complex integrations like Intercom, HubSpot, and advertising platforms require OAuth authentication with specific scope configurations.

**Service Account Authentication**: Enterprise data warehouse integrations utilize service account credentials with granular permission requirements for secure data access.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The Source Catalog integrates seamlessly with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem, feeding data into Amplitude Analytics for behavioral analysis, Amplitude Experiment for feature flagging and experimentation, and Amplitude Audiences for cohort creation and activation. The unified data foundation enables cross-product functionality including behavioral cohort export, experiment result analysis, and comprehensive customer journey mapping across the entire Amplitude Digital Optimization System.

The catalog's comprehensive coverage spans the complete customer data lifecycle from acquisition attribution through engagement tracking to revenue optimization, creating a unified analytics foundation that supports data-driven decision making across marketing, product, and growth teams.
