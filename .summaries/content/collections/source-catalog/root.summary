Amplitude's Source Catalog is a comprehensive data integration ecosystem that enables businesses to centralize customer data from over 70 diverse platforms into Amplitude's behavioral analytics infrastructure. The catalog serves as the primary data ingestion layer, connecting marketing tools, data warehouses, customer engagement platforms, and specialized analytics services to create unified customer data platforms.

## Integration Architecture and Data Flow Patterns

The source catalog operates on four primary integration types that define data flow mechanisms:

**Raw-Events Integration** functions as the core ingestion method, streaming event data directly into Amplitude's analytics pipeline in real-time. This integration type supports platforms like Braze, Segment, and mobile attribution networks, utilizing the HTTP V2 API (`api.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`) for standard event ingestion.

**Cohorts Integration** enables bidirectional data exchange, allowing Amplitude behavioral cohorts to be exported to external platforms while simultaneously importing audience data for enhanced segmentation capabilities. This creates closed-loop marketing workflows between Amplitude and customer engagement platforms.

**Event-Streaming Integration** provides continuous data synchronization, particularly valuable for marketing automation and customer engagement tools that require real-time behavioral data for triggered campaigns and personalization.

**Attribution Integration** leverages Amplitude's specialized Attribution API to handle mobile attribution data from networks like AppsFlyer, Adjust, and Branch. This integration type requires specific Advertising ID (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) matching and operates within 72-hour attribution windows for accurate mobile app attribution.

## Data Warehouse and ETL Infrastructure

The catalog features extensive support for enterprise data warehouse platforms including Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, and Amazon S3, with sophisticated data transformation capabilities:

**Change Data Capture (CDC)** functionality enables real-time synchronization through multiple strategies: Mirror Sync, Append Only Sync, and Timestamp-based import. The Databricks integration specifically leverages Change Data Feed (CDF) for delta sync operations, while Snowflake integration supports four distinct import strategies with custom SQL query requirements.

**Reverse ETL** capabilities through platforms like Hightouch and Census create comprehensive data loops by flowing data warehouse information back into Amplitude as raw events, enabling operational analytics workflows.

Data transformation features include field mapping for event properties, user properties, and group properties, with support for JSON extraction, STRUCT type handling, and custom property enrichment across warehouse platforms.

## Marketing Technology Stack Integration

The catalog extensively covers marketing and advertising platforms with standardized data models:

**Advertising Networks** including Google Ads, Facebook Ads, LinkedIn Ads, TikTok Ads, and X Ads import campaign-level metrics as "Daily Ad Metrics" events. These integrations utilize standardized properties like `ad_metrics.impressions`, `ad_metrics.clicks`, and `ad_metrics.cost` to support Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) calculations through UTM parameter tracking.

**Mobile Attribution Platforms** such as AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch, and Kochava stream real-time attribution data through Amplitude's Attribution API, requiring advertising ID matching and supporting attribution event holding periods for accurate mobile app user acquisition tracking.

**Email Marketing Platforms** like Mailchimp, SendGrid, and HubSpot import email engagement events (opens, clicks, conversions) with specific user ID mapping requirements and webhook configurations for real-time engagement tracking.

## Customer Engagement and Communication Platforms

The catalog includes comprehensive coverage of customer touchpoint platforms:

**Marketing Automation Platforms** including Braze, Iterable, Leanplum, and MoEngage support bidirectional data flow, enabling both event ingestion and cohort export for targeted campaign execution. These integrations create closed-loop marketing workflows where behavioral data informs campaign targeting.

**Customer Communication Platforms** such as OneSignal and Intercom stream messaging events across multiple channels including push notifications, email, SMS, and in-app messaging for comprehensive engagement analytics.

**User Onboarding Platforms** including Userflow, Userguiding, Bento, and Chameleon stream product tour events and onboarding completion data for analyzing user activation funnels and product adoption patterns.

## Revenue and Subscription Analytics

Specialized integrations support monetization and revenue tracking:

**Subscription Platforms** like RevenueCat, Adapty, Apphud, and Nami stream subscription monetization events and in-app purchase data, requiring user ID matching between platforms for accurate revenue attribution and lifetime value calculations.

**Payment Processing** through Stripe integration imports revenue events via webhooks, supporting various payment-related events like `payment_intent.succeeded` and `invoice.payment_succeeded` with currency normalization capabilities for global revenue tracking.

## User Research and Experience Platforms

The catalog covers qualitative and quantitative user research tools:

**Survey and Feedback Platforms** such as Qualtrics, Sprig, Survicate, and Blitzllama import survey response data and qualitative feedback, enabling correlation analysis between user satisfaction metrics and behavioral patterns within Amplitude's analytics framework.

## Key Technical Nomenclature and Definitions

**User Identity Mapping** represents the critical process of connecting user identifiers across platforms, supporting various identifier types including user_id, device_id, email addresses, and platform-specific identifiers like Amplitude's amplitudeDeviceId.

**Attribution Windows** define the time periods (typically 72 hours for mobile attribution) during which attribution events are held and matched to user actions for accurate conversion tracking.

**Change Data Feed (CDF)** refers to Databricks' delta sync capability that tracks data changes for incremental synchronization with Amplitude.

**Mirror Sync, Append Only Sync, and Timestamp-based Import** represent different data synchronization strategies for warehouse integrations, each optimized for specific data update patterns and volume requirements.

## Authentication and Regional Architecture

**Authentication Methods** vary by platform, including OAuth flows (HubSpot, LinkedIn Ads), API key authentication (majority of platforms), and service account configurations (Google Cloud platforms).

**Regional Data Residency** support spans US and EU regions with platform-specific endpoint configurations. EU data residency utilizes corresponding `.eu.amplitude.com` domains for compliance with regional data protection requirements.

## Core API Infrastructure

The catalog utilizes several specialized Amplitude APIs:

- **HTTP V2 API** for standard event ingestion
- **Attribution API** for mobile attribution data streaming
- **Batch Upload API** for high-volume data imports
- **User Privacy API** for data compliance operations

The Source Catalog represents Amplitude's comprehensive approach to creating unified customer data platforms that combine behavioral analytics with marketing attribution, revenue tracking, and customer engagement metrics across the entire customer lifecycle, enabling businesses to build complete pictures of customer journeys from acquisition through retention and monetization.
