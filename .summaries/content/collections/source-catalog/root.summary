## Amplitude Source Catalog: Comprehensive Data Integration Ecosystem

Amplitude's Source Catalog is a comprehensive data integration platform featuring over 70 connectors that enable businesses to centralize customer data from diverse platforms into Amplitude's analytics infrastructure. The catalog serves as the foundational layer for unified customer data analysis, supporting marketing attribution, product analytics, revenue tracking, and customer engagement optimization across the entire technology stack.

## Core Integration Architecture and Data Flow Models

The source catalog operates on four distinct integration paradigms that define data ingestion patterns:

**Raw-Events Integration** forms the primary data ingestion mechanism, streaming behavioral event data directly into Amplitude's analytics pipeline. This integration type supports real-time user journey tracking, product interaction analysis, and comprehensive behavioral analytics across web, mobile, and backend systems.

**Cohorts Integration** enables bidirectional data synchronization, allowing Amplitude to both ingest user segments from external platforms and export behavioral cohorts for targeted campaign execution and personalized user experiences.

**Event-Streaming Integration** provides real-time data synchronization capabilities for platforms requiring immediate data availability, particularly critical for marketing automation workflows and customer engagement orchestration.

**Attribution Integration** leverages Amplitude's Attribution API to process marketing attribution data, implementing Advertising ID (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) matching with 72-hour attribution windows for cross-platform user identity resolution.

## Enterprise Data Warehouse Integration Framework

The catalog features sophisticated enterprise-grade data warehouse connectors supporting **Amazon S3**, **BigQuery**, **Snowflake**, **Databricks**, and **Google Cloud Storage**. These integrations implement advanced data synchronization strategies:

**Mirror Sync** maintains real-time data consistency between warehouse and Amplitude through Change Data Capture (CDC) mechanisms, supporting INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations for comprehensive data state management.

**Append Only Sync** optimizes high-volume event stream ingestion through incremental data loading patterns, minimizing processing overhead for continuous data flows.

**Time-based Import** enables scheduled data synchronization using monotonically increasing timestamp columns for efficient delta processing and historical data backfill operations.

Technical implementation requires specific IAM roles, service account permissions, and converter configurations that transform warehouse schemas into Amplitude's HTTP V2 API specification. Complex data types including STRUCT and RECORD formats are handled through SQL transformations and field mapping configurations.

## Marketing Attribution and Advertising Platform Ecosystem

The catalog extensively covers mobile marketing attribution platforms including **AppsFlyer**, **Adjust**, **Branch**, **Kochava**, and **Singular**, all utilizing Amplitude's Attribution API for mobile marketing measurement. These integrations implement precise Advertising ID matching algorithms and support attribution event holding for delayed user matching scenarios.

Advertising platform integrations for **Facebook Ads**, **Google Ads**, **LinkedIn Ads**, **TikTok Ads**, and **X Ads** import campaign-level performance metrics as "Daily Ad Metrics" events. These events feature standardized properties including `ad_metrics.impressions`, `ad_metrics.clicks`, and `ad_metrics.cost` for Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) calculations. Implementation requires UTM parameter configuration and supports synthetic user identifiers for campaign-level performance analysis.

## Customer Engagement and Marketing Automation Integration

Marketing automation platforms including **Braze**, **Iterable**, **Leanplum**, **MoEngage**, and **OneSignal** support bidirectional data flow architectures, enabling both event ingestion and cohort export for personalized messaging campaigns across email, SMS, push notifications, and in-app communication channels.

Email marketing integrations with **SendGrid**, **Mailchimp**, and **HubSpot** track engagement metrics through webhook configurations, mapping email interaction events to user behavioral profiles for comprehensive customer journey analysis and lifecycle marketing optimization.

## Subscription Revenue and Monetization Analytics

Subscription management platforms **RevenueCat**, **Adapty**, **Apphud**, and **Nami** specialize in mobile app monetization analytics, streaming subscription lifecycle events, revenue data, and in-app purchase analytics. These integrations require user ID matching between platforms and support real-time revenue tracking for subscription optimization and churn prevention.

**Stripe** integration imports financial transaction events through webhook configuration, supporting payment_intent.succeeded, invoice.payment_succeeded, and other revenue events with currency normalization and user ID mapping priority systems for accurate revenue attribution.

## Product Experience and User Onboarding Analytics

User onboarding and product experience platforms including **Userflow**, **Userguiding**, **Chameleon**, **Bento**, and **Candu** track in-app guidance events, product tour completions, and onboarding funnel progression. These integrations enable analysis of feature adoption patterns, user activation metrics, and onboarding effectiveness through event streaming of step completions and interactive guide engagement.

## Survey and Qualitative Feedback Integration

Qualitative feedback platforms **Qualtrics**, **Sprig**, **Survicate**, and **Blitzllama** integrate survey response data with behavioral analytics, enabling correlation analysis between user satisfaction metrics (CSAT, NPS) and product usage patterns. These integrations support automatic email-based user ID mapping and bidirectional cohort sharing for targeted survey distribution and feedback collection optimization.

## Customer Data Platform and Reverse ETL Architecture

Customer Data Platform integrations with **Segment**, **mParticle**, **Tealium**, **RudderStack**, **Hightouch**, and **Census** enable comprehensive data orchestration across the marketing technology stack. **Segment** provides bidirectional integration through the Amplitude (Actions) destination, supporting both client-side bundled integration and server-side implementation with SDK function mappings for track, identify, screen, alias, and group operations.

Reverse ETL platforms **Hightouch** and **Census** synchronize data warehouse data into Amplitude as raw events, enabling real-time customer experience personalization through warehouse-to-Amplitude data pipelines and operational analytics workflows.

## Experimentation and Feature Management Integration

Experimentation platforms **Optimizely**, **Split**, and **Taplytics** integrate A/B testing and feature flag data, streaming experiment variations, traffic impressions, and feature flag events for comprehensive experimentation analysis. **Split** implements traffic type mapping to Amplitude identities (user_id/device_id) while **Optimizely** utilizes custom JSON analytics integration for behavioral cohort synchronization and experiment audience management.

## Key Technical Implementation Patterns and Standards

**API Key Authentication** serves as the primary authentication mechanism across integrations, requiring Amplitude project API keys configured within source platforms for secure data transmission.

**User ID Mapping** ensures cross-platform data correlation through various identifier types including email addresses, custom user IDs, device IDs, and platform-specific identifiers such as `amplitudeUserId` and `amplitudeDeviceId`.

**Event Property Mapping** transforms source platform data structures into Amplitude's standardized event schema through JSON extraction, field mapping configurations, and property transformation rules.

**Regional Data Residency** support enables EU data compliance through region-specific API endpoints (api.eu.amplitude.com) for platforms requiring data localization and privacy regulation compliance.

## Product Ecosystem Integration and Data Unification

The Source Catalog represents Amplitude's comprehensive approach to customer data unification, enabling businesses to create integrated analytics foundations that support advanced behavioral analysis, predictive modeling, and growth optimization. The catalog's extensive integration coverage spans the entire customer lifecycle from acquisition through retention, providing unified visibility into customer behavior, campaign performance, product engagement, and revenue generation across all touchpoints and platforms.
