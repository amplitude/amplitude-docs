Amplitude's Source Catalog is a comprehensive data integration ecosystem that enables businesses to centralize customer behavior analytics from over 70 diverse platforms and tools. The catalog serves as the primary data ingestion layer for Amplitude's analytics platform, supporting attribution platforms, marketing automation tools, data warehouses, customer engagement platforms, and specialized analytics services.

## Integration Architecture and Data Flow Patterns

The source catalog operates through four distinct integration patterns optimized for different data types and use cases:

**Raw Events Integration** forms the backbone of the system, streaming granular event data directly into Amplitude projects while preserving detailed user interactions and behavioral data. This pattern supports platforms like Adapty, Airbridge, Braze, and Google Analytics 4, maintaining event-level fidelity for comprehensive user journey analysis.

**Cohorts Integration** enables bidirectional data flow where Amplitude behavioral cohorts export to external platforms for targeted campaigns while simultaneously importing segmentation data. This creates closed-loop marketing workflows through platforms like Braze, OneSignal, and Segment.

**Attribution API Integration** specializes in mobile attribution data processing, requiring Advertising ID (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) matching within 72-hour attribution windows. This pattern serves mobile measurement platforms including Adjust, AppsFlyer, Branch, and Kochava for marketing channel performance analysis.

**Server-Side vs Client-Side Integration** accommodates various connection methods, from server-side API connections (HubSpot, Salesforce) to client-side SDK implementations (Google Tag Manager, Chameleon), providing flexibility for different technical architectures.

## Data Warehouse and ETL Ecosystem

The catalog features sophisticated support for major cloud data platforms through multiple synchronization strategies:

**Cloud Data Warehouses** including BigQuery, Snowflake, and Databricks support Change Data Capture (CDC), Mirror Sync, Append Only Sync, and Full Sync strategies. These integrations require specific permissions such as BigQuery Job User roles, Storage Admin permissions, and service account configurations for secure data access.

**Cloud Storage** integrations with Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage enable file-based imports through converter configurations, supporting JSON/CSV/parquet formats with structured folder hierarchies (YYYY/MM/DD/HH) and 48-hour search windows for automated data discovery.

**Reverse ETL** capabilities through platforms like Census, Hightouch, and RudderStack enable syncing processed warehouse data back to Amplitude, creating comprehensive closed-loop analytics workflows that leverage both raw behavioral data and processed business intelligence.

## Marketing and Attribution Ecosystem

The catalog extensively supports marketing analytics through specialized ad platform integrations that import campaign-level metrics as "Daily Ad Metrics" events. These integrations include Facebook Ads, Google Ads, LinkedIn Ads, TikTok Ads, and X Ads, providing properties like `ad_metrics.impressions`, `ad_metrics.clicks`, `ad_metrics.cost`, and UTM parameters essential for CAC/ROAS calculations.

Mobile measurement platforms (MMPs) including Adjust, AppsFlyer, Kochava, and Singular provide attribution data through the Attribution API, enabling comprehensive marketing channel performance analysis with cross-platform user tracking capabilities.

Email marketing integrations with SendGrid, Mailchimp, and HubSpot track email engagement metrics including opens, clicks, and conversions, utilizing user ID mapping through unique parameters for comprehensive customer journey tracking.

## Customer Engagement and Experience Platforms

**Messaging Platforms** including Braze, OneSignal, Intercom, and Insider provide bidirectional integration for campaign event tracking and cohort-based targeting across push notifications, email, SMS, and in-app messaging channels.

**Survey and Feedback** platforms like Qualtrics, Sprig, Survicate, and Blitzllama enable qualitative feedback analysis by importing survey responses as raw events with satisfaction scoring and sentiment analysis capabilities.

**Onboarding and Product Experience** tools including Userflow, Userguiding, Bento, and Chameleon track user onboarding journeys, product tour completions, and feature adoption metrics for comprehensive product experience optimization.

## Subscription and Revenue Analytics

Specialized integrations support subscription business models through platforms like RevenueCat, Adapty, Apphud, and Nami, providing subscription event tracking, revenue analytics, and paywall performance metrics specifically designed for mobile app monetization strategies.

Stripe integration imports revenue events through webhook configurations, including `payment_intent.succeeded`, `invoice.payment_succeeded`, and other financial transaction events for comprehensive revenue attribution analysis.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Insert_ID**: Unique identifier for event deduplication across data ingestion processes
**User Properties**: Persistent attributes associated with individual users across sessions
**Group Properties**: Account-level attributes for B2B analytics and organizational reporting
**Event Properties**: Contextual data associated with specific user actions or behaviors
**Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments based on behavioral criteria that can be exported to external platforms
**Attribution Window**: Time period (typically 72 hours) for attributing user actions to marketing touchpoints
**Change Data Capture (CDC)**: Real-time data synchronization method that captures only changed records
**Mirror Sync**: Complete data replication maintaining identical structure between source and destination

## Technical Implementation and API Endpoints

The catalog utilizes multiple authentication methods including OAuth (HubSpot, LinkedIn Ads), API keys (majority of integrations), service accounts (cloud platforms), and webhook configurations (Stripe, SendGrid) for secure data access.

Key API endpoints include:
- `api.amplitude.com/sendgrid` for SendGrid webhook integration
- `api.amplitude.com/iterable` for Iterable campaign metrics
- Attribution API for mobile attribution data processing
- HTTP V2 API for server-side Google Tag Manager integration
- `api.eu.amplitude.com` for EU data residency compliance

The system supports various SDK implementations including JavaScript, iOS, Android, React Native, and Unity, with specific configuration requirements for cross-domain tracking, session management, and user identification across platforms.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The Source Catalog functions as the foundational data ingestion layer within Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem, feeding data into Amplitude's core analytics platform for user behavior analysis, funnel optimization, cohort analysis, and predictive analytics. The bidirectional nature of many integrations enables Amplitude to serve not only as a data destination but as a source of behavioral insights that can activate marketing campaigns, personalization engines, and customer engagement platforms.

Regional compliance features including EU data residency support across multiple integrations with region-specific endpoints ensure global scalability while maintaining GDPR compliance. This comprehensive integration ecosystem positions Amplitude as a central hub for customer behavior analytics, enabling businesses to unify data from their entire technology stack for holistic user journey analysis and data-driven decision making.
