Amplitude's Source Catalog is a comprehensive data integration ecosystem comprising over 70 connectors that enable organizations to centralize behavioral analytics by ingesting data from diverse platforms including marketing automation tools, attribution platforms, customer data platforms, data warehouses, survey tools, and specialized analytics services.

## Integration Architecture and Data Flow Patterns

The source catalog operates through four primary integration patterns that define data ingestion mechanisms:

**Raw Events Integration** streams behavioral events directly into Amplitude's analytics platform, preserving event-level granularity for detailed funnel analysis, cohort creation, and behavioral segmentation. This pattern forms the foundation for most source connections.

**Attribution API Integration** handles marketing attribution data from mobile measurement platforms like AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch, and Singular. These integrations require Advertising ID (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) matching and maintain 72-hour attribution windows for mobile attribution analysis.

**Cohorts Integration** enables bidirectional data flow, allowing Amplitude to export behavioral cohorts to marketing platforms like Braze, Iterable, and OneSignal while simultaneously importing campaign performance data for closed-loop marketing optimization.

**Event-Streaming Integration** provides real-time data synchronization for platforms requiring immediate data availability, commonly used by customer engagement platforms and real-time personalization tools.

**Warehouse Integration** supports enterprise-scale data ingestion from cloud platforms including Snowflake, BigQuery, and Databricks, featuring advanced capabilities like Change Data Capture (CDC), Mirror Sync, and Append Only strategies.

## Core Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Integration Types** classify technical data transfer mechanisms:
- `raw-events`: Direct event ingestion maintaining full event properties
- `event-streaming`: Real-time bidirectional data flow
- `cohorts`: Behavioral segment sharing capabilities  
- `attribution`: Marketing attribution data via Attribution API

**Integration Categories** organize sources by business function:
- `marketing-automation`: Email, SMS, and campaign platforms
- `attribution`: Mobile marketing measurement platforms
- `subscription-management`: Revenue and subscription analytics
- `customer-engagement`: User experience and messaging platforms
- `data-warehouse`: Enterprise data storage and ETL platforms
- `qualitative-feedback`: Survey and feedback collection tools

**User Identity Mapping** enables cross-platform analytics through:
- `user_id`: Primary user identifier for cross-platform tracking
- `device_id`: Device-specific identifier for attribution
- `amplitudeUserId`/`amplitudeDeviceId`: Platform-specific ID mapping
- `customerUserId`: External platform user identification

**Data Synchronization Patterns**:
- **Mirror Sync**: Maintains exact replica with INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations
- **Append Only**: Adds new data without modifying existing records
- **Time-based Import**: Incremental updates based on timestamp fields
- **Full Sync**: Complete data refresh on each import cycle

## Ecosystem Integration and Product Relationships

The source catalog integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics platform through several key components:

**Amplitude Data** serves as the central ingestion layer, providing enterprise-grade data governance, schema enforcement, and data quality monitoring across all source integrations.

**Attribution API** functions as a specialized endpoint (`/attribution`) for marketing attribution data, enabling real-time attribution analysis and campaign performance measurement across mobile advertising platforms.

**Behavioral Cohorts** created from source data can be exported to marketing platforms, creating closed-loop workflows where campaign performance data flows back into Amplitude for analysis.

**Session Replay and Autocapture** complement source integrations by providing additional behavioral context, particularly valuable when combined with survey data from platforms like Sprig, Survicate, and Qualtrics.

**Portfolio and Governance** features enable enterprise organizations to manage source integrations across multiple projects while maintaining data governance standards and access controls.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Primary API Endpoints**:
- Attribution API: `/attribution` for marketing attribution data
- HTTP V2 API: `/2/httpapi` for batch event ingestion
- Lookup Table API: For CSV-based property enrichment
- User Privacy API: For GDPR compliance and data deletion

**Authentication Methods**:
- OAuth flows for platforms like HubSpot, LinkedIn Ads, and Google Ads
- API key authentication for direct integrations
- Service account authentication for warehouse integrations
- Webhook-based authentication for real-time platforms

**Data Transformation Capabilities**:
- JSON property extraction using `JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR` functions
- STRUCT type handling for complex data structures
- UTM parameter mapping for marketing attribution
- Custom field mapping through converter configurations

**Platform-Specific Commands and Configurations**:
- BigQuery: `SELECT JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR(event_properties, '$.property_name')`
- Snowflake: `OBJECT_CONSTRUCT('key', value)` for JSON property construction
- S3/GCS: Date prefix format `YYYY/MM/DD/HH` for file organization
- Databricks: Change Data Feed (CDF) configuration for delta sync

The source catalog represents Amplitude's comprehensive approach to data integration, enabling organizations to create unified customer data platforms while maintaining flexibility to leverage specialized tools across their technology stack. The system supports both real-time streaming and batch processing workflows, accommodating diverse enterprise data architecture requirements.
