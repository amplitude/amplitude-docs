Amplitude's Source Catalog is a comprehensive data integration ecosystem comprising over 80 connectors that enable organizations to centralize behavioral analytics by importing data from diverse external platforms. The catalog serves as the foundation for creating unified customer data platforms that combine behavioral, marketing, subscription, and operational data for holistic analytics.

## Integration Architecture and Data Flow Patterns

The Source Catalog operates through four primary integration patterns, each optimized for specific data flow requirements:

**Raw Events Integration** forms the core pattern, importing external platform events directly into Amplitude as structured behavioral data while preserving original event properties and user context. This pattern supports marketing automation platforms (Braze, HubSpot, Intercom), subscription services (RevenueCat, Adapty), and customer engagement tools.

**Event Streaming Integration** enables real-time bidirectional data synchronization, primarily used for mobile attribution partners (AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch) that require immediate data exchange for marketing attribution and campaign optimization workflows.

**Cohorts Integration** facilitates behavioral audience sharing by exporting Amplitude-created cohorts to external marketing platforms (Mailchimp, OneSignal, Leanplum) for targeted campaign execution and closed-loop marketing optimization.

**Attribution API Integration** provides specialized handling for mobile attribution platforms through dedicated API endpoints that process attribution data with Advertising ID matching (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) and configurable attribution windows.

## Enterprise Data Warehouse Ecosystem

The catalog includes sophisticated enterprise-grade data warehouse integrations supporting large-scale data operations:

**Cloud Data Warehouses** feature native integrations with Snowflake, BigQuery, and Databricks, incorporating Change Data Capture (CDC) capabilities and multiple synchronization strategies including Full Sync, Mirror Sync, Append Only, and Timestamp-based syncing. These integrations support advanced SQL transformations for complex data modeling requirements.

**Cloud Storage Platforms** provide direct import capabilities from Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage with configurable file format support (JSON, CSV, Parquet), automated date-based partitioning, and IAM role-based security configurations for enterprise compliance.

**Reverse ETL Platforms** integrate with modern data stack tools like Census and Hightouch, enabling operational analytics by syncing warehouse data back into Amplitude for real-time customer experience personalization.

## Marketing Technology Stack Coverage

The catalog provides comprehensive marketing attribution and advertising intelligence through specialized integrations:

**Advertising Platforms** include dedicated connectors for Facebook Ads, Google Ads, LinkedIn Ads, TikTok Ads, and X Ads that import campaign-level metrics as standardized "Daily Ad Metrics" events. These events include normalized properties (ad_metrics.impressions, ad_metrics.clicks, ad_metrics.cost) with UTM parameter mapping for Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) analysis.

**Mobile Attribution Partners** support sophisticated attribution workflows with Advertising ID matching, configurable attribution windows (typically 72 hours), and real-time attribution data streaming for performance measurement and optimization.

**Customer Engagement Platforms** provide bidirectional integrations with platforms like Braze, Iterable, and MoEngage, supporting both campaign event ingestion and behavioral cohort export for comprehensive marketing automation.

## Technical Architecture and Nomenclature

**Integration Classifications** include raw-events (direct event import), event-streaming (bidirectional real-time), cohorts (audience export), server-side (backend integration), and client-side (frontend SDK integration) patterns.

**Authentication Mechanisms** span OAuth flows for platforms like HubSpot and Intercom, API key authentication for most standard integrations, service account configurations for cloud platforms, and webhook-based authentication for real-time event streaming.

**User Identity Resolution** employs sophisticated mapping supporting multiple identifier types including email addresses, custom user IDs, device IDs, and platform-specific identifiers with hierarchical fallback mechanisms for cross-platform identity resolution.

**Data Transformation Capabilities** include built-in converter configurations for warehouse integrations, JSON property extraction for complex nested data structures, and automated field mapping between external platform schemas and Amplitude's standardized event specification.

## Specialized Vertical Integration Categories

**Subscription and Revenue Analytics** encompasses dedicated integrations for subscription platforms (RevenueCat, Adapty, Nami, Apphud) that track complete subscription lifecycle events, revenue attribution, and customer lifetime value metrics with cross-platform subscription tracking capabilities.

**Product Experience and Onboarding** includes integrations with product tour platforms (Userflow, Userguiding, Chameleon, Bento) that capture user onboarding progression, feature adoption metrics, and product engagement data for activation funnel analysis.

**Experimentation and Feature Management** connects to A/B testing platforms (Optimizely, Split, Taplytics) for importing experiment exposure data and feature flag interactions, enabling statistical analysis of product experiments within Amplitude's analytics framework.

**Customer Feedback and Surveys** incorporates qualitative feedback integrations (Sprig, Survicate, Qualtrics, Blitzllama) that correlate survey responses with behavioral data for comprehensive user experience analysis and voice-of-customer insights.

## Enterprise Governance and Compliance Framework

**Regional Data Residency** supports EU data residency requirements across multiple integrations with region-specific API endpoints and localized data processing configurations for GDPR compliance.

**Privacy and Compliance Integration** connects with Amplitude's User Privacy API for automated data deletion and privacy compliance workflows, including coordinated user data removal across integrated platforms.

**Schema Enforcement Compatibility** ensures integration with Amplitude's Schema enforcement features to maintain data quality and consistency across all imported data sources with validation and error handling.

**Monitoring and Observability** provides built-in ingestion job monitoring, comprehensive error handling, and data quality validation with detailed logging and alerting for troubleshooting integration issues and ensuring data pipeline reliability.

The Source Catalog represents Amplitude's unified approach to data integration, enabling organizations to construct comprehensive behavioral analytics platforms that synthesize data from their entire technology stack for unified customer understanding, advanced segmentation, and data-driven product and marketing optimization.
