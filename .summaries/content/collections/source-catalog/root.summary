## Amplitude Source Catalog: Comprehensive Data Integration Ecosystem

Amplitude's Source Catalog is a comprehensive data integration platform featuring over 70 connectors that centralize behavioral analytics, marketing attribution, and customer engagement data into Amplitude's analytics infrastructure. The catalog enables businesses to unify data from diverse platforms including data warehouses, marketing automation tools, attribution platforms, and customer engagement systems.

## Integration Architecture and Data Flow Patterns

The source catalog operates on four distinct integration types that define data ingestion patterns:

**Raw-Events Integration** represents the primary data flow mechanism, ingesting granular event data directly through Amplitude's HTTP V2 API specification. This pattern maintains complete event fidelity and supports comprehensive behavioral analysis across user journeys.

**Cohorts Integration** enables bidirectional data exchange, allowing platforms to both send behavioral data to Amplitude and receive user cohorts for targeted campaigns and personalization initiatives.

**Attribution Integration** leverages Amplitude's specialized Attribution API for mobile measurement platform (MMP) data, requiring Advertising ID matching (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) with 72-hour attribution windows for accurate user identification.

**Event-Streaming Integration** provides real-time data synchronization capabilities, supporting continuous behavioral tracking and immediate analytics updates across connected platforms.

## Data Warehouse and ETL Infrastructure

The catalog provides extensive support for enterprise data warehouse platforms including **Snowflake**, **BigQuery**, **Databricks**, and **Amazon S3**, each offering sophisticated data transformation capabilities through multiple synchronization strategies:

- **Mirror Sync** with Change Data Capture (CDC) for real-time delta updates
- **Append Only Sync** for incremental data loading patterns
- **Full Sync** for complete data refresh operations
- **Time-based Import** using monotonically increasing timestamp fields

Data warehouse integrations require platform-specific authentication including service accounts, IAM roles, and personal access tokens, with detailed SQL transformation requirements for handling STRUCT types, JSON properties, and VARIANT data formats.

## Marketing Attribution and Advertising Platform Ecosystem

The catalog extensively covers mobile attribution through integrations with leading MMPs including **AppsFlyer**, **Adjust**, **Branch**, **Kochava**, and **Singular**, all utilizing Amplitude's Attribution API for comprehensive customer acquisition cost (CAC) and return on ad spend (ROAS) analysis.

Advertising platform integrations spanning **Google Ads**, **Facebook Ads**, **LinkedIn Ads**, **TikTok Ads**, and **X Ads** import campaign-level metrics as standardized "Daily Ad Metrics" events with properties including `ad_metrics.impressions`, `ad_metrics.clicks`, and `ad_metrics.cost`, supporting UTM parameter tracking for multi-touch attribution analysis.

## Customer Engagement and Marketing Automation

Marketing automation platforms including **Braze**, **Iterable**, **Leanplum**, **MoEngage**, and **OneSignal** support bidirectional data flow, enabling both event ingestion and cohort export for targeted messaging across email, SMS, push notifications, and in-app communication channels.

Customer relationship management tools such as **Intercom**, **HubSpot**, and **Salesforce** provide comprehensive customer lifecycle data with specialized group-level property mapping for account-based analytics and B2B customer journey tracking.

## Subscription and Revenue Analytics

Subscription management platforms including **RevenueCat**, **Adapty**, **Apphud**, and **Nami** focus on mobile app monetization, streaming subscription events, revenue data, and in-app purchase analytics. **Stripe** integration provides comprehensive revenue event tracking through webhook configuration, supporting payment intent, invoice, and charge event analysis.

## Product Experience and User Onboarding

User experience platforms such as **Userflow**, **Userguiding**, **Chameleon**, **Bento**, and **Candu** track product adoption through onboarding guide events, product tour completions, and feature engagement metrics, enabling analysis of user activation funnels and retention optimization.

## Survey and Feedback Analytics

Qualitative feedback platforms including **Sprig**, **Survicate**, **Qualtrics**, and **Blitzllama** integrate survey response data with behavioral analytics, supporting CSAT, NPS, and custom survey analysis for comprehensive user experience measurement and product feedback correlation.

## Key Technical Nomenclature and Definitions

**API Key Authentication** serves as the primary authorization mechanism across integrations, requiring Amplitude project API keys for secure data ingestion access.

**User ID Mapping** ensures consistent user identification across platforms through standardized identifiers including `user_id`, `device_id`, and platform-specific identifiers like `amplitudeUserId` and `amplitudeDeviceId`.

**Insert ID Deduplication** prevents duplicate event ingestion through unique event identifiers, particularly critical for webhook-based integrations and high-volume data streams.

**Event Properties and User Properties** follow Amplitude's HTTP V2 API specification, supporting JSON formatting and nested object structures for comprehensive event metadata and user attribute tracking.

**UTM Parameter Tracking** enables cross-platform marketing attribution through automatic population of `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`, `utm_content`, and `utm_term` parameters across advertising integrations.

## Integration Management and Monitoring

The source catalog provides comprehensive operational oversight through **Ingestion Jobs** tracking, **Data Sources** management interfaces, and **Schema Enforcement** capabilities. Many integrations maintain **Partner-Maintained** status, indicating external platform responsibility for integration maintenance and feature updates.

**EU Data Residency** support ensures compliance with regional data processing requirements through specific endpoint configurations for European data governance across multiple integrations.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The Source Catalog functions as the primary data ingestion layer within Amplitude's comprehensive product analytics ecosystem, enabling sophisticated cross-platform analytics by unifying behavioral data, marketing attribution, customer engagement metrics, and revenue analytics. This unified data foundation supports advanced analytics capabilities including cohort analysis, funnel optimization, retention measurement, and predictive analytics across the complete customer lifecycle.

The catalog's extensive integration coverage enables businesses to implement comprehensive data-driven decision making by connecting disparate data sources into Amplitude's centralized analytics platform, supporting everything from acquisition attribution to product engagement optimization and revenue analysis.
