## Amplitude Source Catalog

Amplitude's Source Catalog is a comprehensive data integration ecosystem comprising over 70 connectors that enable organizations to centralize behavioral analytics, marketing attribution, and customer engagement data from diverse platforms into Amplitude's analytics infrastructure. The catalog spans marketing automation platforms, attribution providers, customer data platforms, data warehouses, and specialized analytics tools, creating a unified foundation for customer behavior analysis.

## Integration Architecture and Product Relationships

The source catalog operates through four primary integration patterns that define data flow into Amplitude:

**Raw Events Integration** forms the core architecture, ingesting event data directly into Amplitude's event stream with minimal transformation. This pattern supports behavioral analytics platforms like Braze, Intercom, HubSpot, and subscription management tools including RevenueCat and Adapty, enabling comprehensive cross-platform behavioral analysis.

**Attribution API Integration** handles marketing attribution data from mobile measurement platforms like AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch, and Kochava. These integrations utilize Amplitude's Attribution API to correlate user acquisition events with downstream behavioral patterns, supporting 72-hour attribution windows and advertising ID matching through IDFA/IDFV/ADID.

**Cohorts Integration** enables bidirectional data flow, allowing Amplitude to export behavioral cohorts to marketing platforms like Braze, Leanplum, and OneSignal for targeted campaign execution while simultaneously importing campaign performance data back into Amplitude for closed-loop marketing optimization.

**Event-Streaming Integration** provides real-time data synchronization for platforms requiring immediate data availability, supporting real-time personalization and dynamic user segmentation use cases.

**Warehouse Integration** connects enterprise data infrastructure through Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, and Amazon S3, supporting multiple sync strategies including Full Sync, Mirror Sync, Append Only Sync, and Change Data Capture (CDC) for comprehensive data warehouse analytics.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Integration Types** classify data flow patterns:
- `raw-events`: Direct event ingestion into Amplitude's event stream
- `cohorts`: Bidirectional user segment sharing between platforms
- `event-streaming`: Real-time data synchronization
- `attribution`: Marketing attribution data via Attribution API

**Integration Categories** organize source platforms:
- `marketing-automation`: Email, SMS, push notification platforms
- `attribution`: Mobile marketing measurement platforms
- `subscription-management`: In-app purchase and subscription analytics
- `customer-engagement`: User onboarding and product adoption tools
- `data-warehouse`: Enterprise data infrastructure
- `cdp`: Customer Data Platforms
- `experimentation`: A/B testing and feature flag platforms

**Data Mapping Concepts**:
- `user_id` mapping: Cross-platform user identifier synchronization
- `device_id` mapping: Device-level tracking coordination
- `insert_id`: Event deduplication mechanism
- `amplitudeDeviceId`/`amplitudeUserId`: Platform-specific identifier mapping

**Sync Strategies** for warehouse integrations:
- **Full Sync**: Complete data refresh on each import cycle
- **Mirror Sync**: Maintains exact replica with CDC support
- **Append Only Sync**: Incremental data addition without updates
- **Time-based Import**: Timestamp-driven incremental updates

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The source catalog integrates with Amplitude's analytics ecosystem through multiple touchpoints:

**Amplitude Analytics Platform** serves as the central data repository, with sources feeding core analytics capabilities including behavioral cohorts, funnel analysis, retention tracking, and user journey mapping.

**Amplitude Data** provides enterprise data management, supporting warehouse integrations, lookup tables for data enrichment, and data governance through the User Privacy API.

**Marketing Analytics Suite** leverages advertising platform integrations (Google Ads, Facebook Ads, LinkedIn Ads, TikTok Ads) to provide unified campaign performance analysis through the Ad Performance dashboard, supporting CAC/ROAS calculations and UTM parameter tracking.

**Attribution Analytics** combines mobile measurement platform data with behavioral analytics for comprehensive user acquisition analysis, supporting multi-touch attribution and incrementality measurement.

**Customer Engagement Optimization** utilizes bidirectional integrations with platforms like Braze, Iterable, and OneSignal to create closed-loop marketing systems where behavioral insights drive campaign targeting and results inform behavioral analysis.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Attribution API** (`/attribution`) handles marketing attribution data from mobile measurement platforms, supporting real-time attribution event ingestion with advertising ID matching capabilities.

**HTTP V2 API** (`/2/httpapi`) serves as the primary endpoint for raw event ingestion, supporting both batch uploads and real-time streaming from various source platforms.

**Batch Upload API** processes high-volume data imports from warehouse sources, supporting compressed data formats and bulk event processing.

**Regional Endpoints** support data residency requirements:
- US: `api.amplitude.com`
- EU: `api.eu.amplitude.com`

**Platform-Specific Webhook Endpoints**:
- SendGrid: `/sendgrid`
- Stripe: `/stripe` with webhook configuration
- Custom endpoints for real-time event streaming

**Authentication Methods**:
- API Key authentication for standard integrations
- OAuth flows for platforms like HubSpot, Intercom, and Google services
- Service Account authentication for warehouse integrations
- JWT tokens for enterprise data warehouse connections

The source catalog represents Amplitude's unified approach to data integration, enabling organizations to create a comprehensive customer behavior analysis foundation while maintaining flexibility to leverage specialized tools across their technology stack.
