## Amplitude Source Catalog

Amplitude's Source Catalog is a comprehensive data integration ecosystem comprising over 60 integrations that enable organizations to centralize behavioral analytics by importing data from diverse platforms including marketing automation tools, attribution platforms, customer data platforms, data warehouses, survey tools, and specialized analytics services. The catalog serves as the primary data ingestion layer for Amplitude's analytics platform, supporting multiple integration patterns to accommodate various technical architectures and business use cases.

## Product and Feature Relationships

The source catalog operates through four primary integration patterns that define data flow architectures:

**Raw Events Integration** serves as the foundational pattern where external platforms transmit event data directly to Amplitude's HTTP V2 API. This pattern supports platforms like Braze, HubSpot, Intercom, RevenueCat, and Adapty for streaming user behavioral events, campaign interactions, and monetization data.

**Event Streaming Integration** enables bidirectional real-time data synchronization, primarily implemented by customer engagement platforms including OneSignal, MoEngage, and Iterable. These integrations both send messaging events to Amplitude and consume Amplitude's behavioral cohorts for targeted campaign execution.

**Cohorts Integration** facilitates the export of Amplitude's behavioral segments to external platforms for user activation, enabling tools like Optimizely, Split, and various marketing automation platforms to leverage product usage patterns for targeting and personalization.

**Attribution Integration** utilizes Amplitude's specialized Attribution API to ingest mobile attribution data from Mobile Measurement Partners (MMPs) including AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch, and Kochava, supporting advertising ID matching (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) with configurable attribution windows.

**Warehouse Integration** provides enterprise-grade data import capabilities through cloud data platforms like Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks, and Amazon S3, supporting multiple synchronization strategies including Full Sync, Mirror Sync, Append Only, and Change Data Capture (CDC) for real-time data processing.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Integration Types** classify technical implementation patterns:
- `raw-events`: Direct event ingestion via HTTP V2 API
- `event-streaming`: Bidirectional real-time data flow with webhook support
- `cohorts`: Behavioral segment export capability for user activation
- `attribution`: Mobile attribution data ingestion via Attribution API

**Integration Categories** organize integrations by business function:
- `marketing-automation`: Campaign management and messaging platforms
- `subscription-management`: Monetization and revenue tracking systems
- `customer-engagement`: User experience and onboarding tools
- `experimentation`: A/B testing and feature flag platforms
- `qualitative-feedback`: Survey and user feedback collection tools
- `warehouse`: Enterprise data infrastructure and storage platforms

**User Identity Mapping** ensures cross-platform data consistency through identifier strategies:
- `user_id`: Primary user identifier for cross-platform correlation
- `device_id`: Device-level tracking alignment
- `amplitudeUserId`/`amplitudeDeviceId`: Platform-specific identifier mapping
- `customerUserId`: External platform user correlation

**Data Delivery Patterns** define ingestion frequency and methods:
- Real-time streaming via webhooks and API calls
- Batch processing with configurable intervals (hourly/daily)
- API-based synchronization with rate limiting
- File-based imports supporting CSV, JSON, and Parquet formats

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The source catalog integrates with Amplitude's analytics ecosystem through several interconnected components:

**Amplitude Data** functions as the central ingestion and processing layer, applying data governance, schema validation, user privacy controls, and routing processed events to analytics workspaces. All source integrations flow through this layer for standardization and quality assurance.

**Behavioral Cohorts** created from aggregated source data can be exported back to marketing and engagement platforms, establishing closed-loop optimization workflows where product usage insights directly influence campaign targeting and user personalization strategies.

**Attribution Analysis** combines mobile attribution data from MMPs with first-party behavioral events to provide comprehensive user acquisition analysis, marketing ROI measurement, and campaign performance optimization across the entire user journey.

**Revenue Analytics** integrates subscription and transaction data from platforms like Stripe, RevenueCat, and Adapty with behavioral patterns to enable advanced monetization analysis, customer lifetime value optimization, and revenue attribution modeling.

**Cross-Platform Identity Resolution** unifies user journeys across web, mobile, and server-side touchpoints by correlating identifiers from various source platforms, enabling comprehensive user behavior analysis across all digital touchpoints.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Primary API Endpoints**:
- `api.amplitude.com/httpapi/v2` - Raw events ingestion endpoint
- `api.amplitude.com/attribution` - Mobile attribution data endpoint
- `api.amplitude.com/sendgrid` - SendGrid-specific webhook endpoint
- Regional endpoints supporting EU data residency requirements

**Authentication Methods** vary by integration type:
- API key authentication for raw events integrations
- OAuth 2.0 flows for platforms like HubSpot, Intercom, and social advertising platforms
- Service account authentication for warehouse integrations
- Webhook signature verification for real-time event streaming

**Data Transformation Capabilities**:
- Converter configurations for warehouse imports using JSON mapping rules
- Field mapping for CRM and marketing automation platforms
- Event property standardization across different source schemas
- User property enrichment through lookup tables and cross-platform correlation

**Command Line and Configuration Examples**:
- BigQuery SQL transformations using `JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR` functions for property extraction
- Snowflake CDC queries with `OBJECT_CONSTRUCT` for JSON property handling
- Google Tag Manager template configurations for both client-side and server-side implementations
- Webhook URL configurations for platforms like Stripe, SendGrid, and subscription management tools

The source catalog represents Amplitude's strategic approach to becoming the central analytics hub for product teams by providing comprehensive data ingestion capabilities that support the complete spectrum of modern digital product development, marketing automation, and user engagement workflows.
