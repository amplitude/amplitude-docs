## Amplitude Source Catalog: Comprehensive Data Integration Ecosystem

Amplitude's Source Catalog is a comprehensive data integration platform featuring over 70 connectors that centralize customer data from diverse platforms into Amplitude's analytics infrastructure. The catalog serves as the primary data ingestion layer for businesses seeking to unify behavioral analytics, marketing attribution, revenue tracking, and customer engagement data across their entire technology stack.

## Integration Architecture and Data Flow Models

The source catalog operates on four distinct integration paradigms that define data movement patterns:

**Raw-Events Integration** streams behavioral event data directly into Amplitude's analytics pipeline, capturing user interactions, transaction events, and engagement metrics from platforms like Braze, Segment, and mParticle. This integration type forms the foundation for behavioral analytics and user journey mapping.

**Event-Streaming Integration** provides real-time data synchronization primarily for attribution and marketing platforms including AppsFlyer, Branch, and Kochava. These integrations utilize Amplitude's Attribution API with 72-hour attribution matching windows and require Advertising ID alignment (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) for accurate user attribution tracking.

**Cohorts Integration** enables bidirectional data flow, allowing behavioral segments created within Amplitude to be exported back to marketing platforms like HubSpot, Braze, and OneSignal for targeted campaign execution and audience activation.

**Server-Side Integration** handles enterprise-grade data imports requiring OAuth authentication or complex data transformations, supporting platforms like Salesforce, Intercom, and various advertising networks with sophisticated authentication workflows.

## Cloud Data Platform Ecosystem

The catalog provides extensive support for major cloud data warehouses through specialized import mechanisms:

**Amazon S3 Import** offers bidirectional synchronization with IAM role configuration, converter mapping, and strategic data handling through Mirror Sync versus Append Only methodologies. The integration supports mutation operations (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) and requires specific S3 bucket permissions and cross-account role assumptions.

**BigQuery Integration** leverages Google Cloud's data warehouse through BigQuery linking, supporting GA4 imports and direct table ingestion with Change Data Feed capabilities. The integration requires SQL transformations for STRUCT data types and utilizes service account authentication with specific BigQuery permissions.

**Snowflake Integration** implements four distinct import strategies: Full Sync, Timestamp-based incremental, Append Only, and Mirror Sync. The integration supports Change Data Capture (CDC) and requires specialized SQL queries using OBJECT_CONSTRUCT functions for complex data type handling.

**Databricks Integration** utilizes Change Data Feed (CDF) for delta sync operations, requiring all-purpose compute clusters and personal access token authentication for secure data access.

## Attribution and Marketing Analytics Framework

The source catalog emphasizes marketing attribution through specialized platform integrations:

**Mobile Attribution Platforms** including AppsFlyer, Adjust, Kochava, and Singular integrate via Amplitude's Attribution API, implementing 72-hour attribution windows and requiring precise Advertising ID matching for user identity resolution across marketing touchpoints.

**Ad Network Integrations** for Facebook Ads, Google Ads, LinkedIn Ads, TikTok Ads, and X Ads import campaign-level performance metrics as "Daily Ad Metrics" events. These integrations capture properties like `ad_metrics.impressions`, `ad_metrics.clicks`, and UTM parameters essential for CAC/ROAS calculations and marketing performance analysis.

**Marketing Automation Platforms** such as Braze, HubSpot, Iterable, and Mailchimp provide comprehensive bidirectional data flow, ingesting campaign events while enabling behavioral cohort targeting for personalized marketing campaigns.

## Customer Experience and Engagement Platforms

The catalog encompasses comprehensive customer experience tooling:

**Survey and Feedback Platforms** including Qualtrics, Sprig, Survicate, and Blitzllama stream qualitative feedback data with automatic email-based user mapping and survey response categorization, enabling correlation between user behavior and satisfaction metrics.

**Customer Support Integration** through Intercom provides conversation, contact, and user event streaming with OAuth authentication and automatic "[Intercom]" event prefixing for clear data source identification.

**Onboarding and Product Tour Platforms** such as Userflow, Userguiding, Bento, and Chameleon track user activation through step completion events and guide engagement metrics, providing insights into product adoption patterns.

## Subscription and Revenue Analytics

Specialized integrations focus on subscription business model analytics:

**Subscription Management Platforms** including RevenueCat, Adapty, Apphud, and Nami stream subscription lifecycle events, revenue data, and in-app purchase analytics with precise user ID matching requirements for accurate revenue attribution.

**Payment Processing Integration** through Stripe imports revenue events via webhooks, supporting events like `payment_intent.succeeded`, `invoice.payment_succeeded`, and other financial transaction events critical for revenue analytics and customer lifetime value calculations.

## Technical Implementation Patterns and Requirements

**Authentication Mechanisms** vary by platform complexity, ranging from API key configuration (most integrations) to OAuth flows (HubSpot, Intercom, LinkedIn Ads) and service account setup for Google Cloud services, each requiring specific permission scopes and security configurations.

**User Identity Resolution** requires precise alignment between platform-specific user identifiers and Amplitude's user_id/device_id system, with custom mapping configurations ensuring accurate cross-platform user journey tracking.

**Data Processing and Quotas** are managed through batch processing systems, real-time streaming limits, and partner-specific rate limiting based on integration type and data volume, ensuring reliable data ingestion without overwhelming downstream systems.

**Data Transformation Capabilities** include converter configurations for data format standardization, SQL query requirements for warehouse integrations, and automatic field mapping for standardized event schemas that maintain data consistency across diverse source systems.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Source Catalog functions as the primary data ingestion layer within Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem, feeding data into Amplitude Analytics for behavioral analysis, Amplitude Experiment for feature flagging, and Amplitude Audiences for customer segmentation. The catalog's bidirectional capabilities enable closed-loop marketing workflows where insights generated in Amplitude can be activated across the entire marketing and customer engagement stack.

The source catalog represents Amplitude's strategic positioning as the central analytics hub for modern data stacks, providing comprehensive coverage across the complete customer journey from acquisition through retention, with particular strength in mobile attribution, marketing automation, and subscription analytics use cases.
