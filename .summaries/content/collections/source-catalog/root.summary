Amplitude's Source Catalog is a comprehensive data integration ecosystem comprising over 80 connectors that enable organizations to centralize behavioral analytics by importing data from diverse external platforms. The catalog serves as the foundational layer for creating unified customer journey analytics by connecting marketing automation, attribution tracking, customer engagement, subscription management, data warehouses, and experimentation platforms into a single behavioral analytics foundation.

## Integration Architecture and Product Relationships

The source catalog operates through four primary integration patterns that form the core product architecture:

**Raw Events Integration** represents the primary integration type, importing external platform events directly into Amplitude as structured events with standardized properties. These integrations require API key authentication and user ID mapping between platforms, forming the backbone of behavioral data collection.

**Event Streaming Integration** enables real-time bidirectional data flow, supporting both data import from external sources and export of Amplitude behavioral cohorts to partner platforms for targeting and personalization. This creates closed-loop marketing and engagement workflows.

**Cohorts Integration** facilitates sharing of Amplitude's behavioral segments with external platforms while optionally importing engagement data back to Amplitude, enabling audience activation across the marketing technology stack.

**Attribution Integration** utilizes specialized Amplitude Attribution API endpoints to import mobile attribution data with specific requirements for advertising ID matching (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) and attribution windows, connecting paid acquisition to behavioral outcomes.

## Data Infrastructure and Warehouse Ecosystem

The catalog's enterprise data infrastructure centers on sophisticated warehouse integrations supporting large-scale data operations:

**Cloud Data Warehouses** including Snowflake, BigQuery, and Databricks feature Change Data Capture (CDC), multiple sync strategies (Full Sync, Mirror Sync, Append Only, Timestamp-based), and SQL transformation capabilities for complex data mapping and schema management.

**Cloud Storage** integrations with Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage support converter configuration, file pattern matching, and automated ingestion with date-prefix organization requirements for structured data lakes.

**Reverse ETL Platforms** including Census, Hightouch, and RudderStack enable operational analytics by syncing warehouse data back to Amplitude, creating feedback loops between data warehouses and real-time customer experience optimization.

## Marketing Technology Stack Integration

The catalog provides comprehensive coverage of the marketing ecosystem through specialized integration patterns:

**Advertising Platforms** including Facebook Ads, Google Ads, LinkedIn Ads, TikTok Ads, and X Ads import campaign-level metrics as "Daily Ad Metrics" events with standardized properties like `ad_metrics.impressions`, `ad_metrics.clicks`, `ad_metrics.cost`, and UTM parameter mapping for CAC/ROAS calculations.

**Attribution Platforms** including AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch, Kochava, and Singular utilize the Attribution API with 72-hour attribution windows and advertising ID matching requirements, connecting paid acquisition to downstream behavioral analytics.

**Marketing Automation** platforms including HubSpot, Braze, Iterable, Leanplum, MoEngage, and OneSignal support bidirectional data flow for campaign event tracking and behavioral cohort targeting, enabling closed-loop campaign optimization.

## Customer Experience and Engagement Platform Ecosystem

**Messaging and Communication** integrations including Intercom, SendGrid, and Mailchimp track conversational events and email engagement metrics with platform-specific event prefixes and webhook-based data delivery for omnichannel customer journey mapping.

**User Onboarding and Product Tours** through Chameleon, Userflow, Userguiding, and Bento integrations capture step completion, guide engagement, and onboarding funnel events for activation analysis and product adoption optimization.

**Survey and Feedback** platforms including Qualtrics, Sprig, Survicate, and Blitzllama import qualitative feedback data as structured events for satisfaction-based cohort creation and sentiment analysis integration with behavioral data.

## Revenue and Subscription Analytics Integration

**Subscription Management** through RevenueCat, Adapty, Apphud, and Nami integrations track mobile app subscription events, revenue data, and in-app purchase analytics with user ID synchronization requirements for comprehensive revenue attribution.

**Payment Processing** via Stripe integration imports revenue events through webhooks supporting `payment_intent.succeeded`, `charge.succeeded`, and `invoice.payment_succeeded` events for transaction-level behavioral analysis.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Integration Types**:
- `raw-events`: Direct event import with property mapping and schema transformation
- `event-streaming`: Bidirectional real-time data flow with cohort export capabilities
- `cohorts`: Behavioral segment sharing with optional engagement data import
- `attribution`: Mobile attribution data via specialized Attribution API endpoints

**Authentication Methods**: API key authentication, OAuth flows, service account permissions, webhook configurations with regional endpoint support

**User Identity Mapping**: User ID synchronization, device ID mapping, email-based identification, advertising ID matching (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) for cross-platform user journey tracking

**Data Processing**: Insert ID deduplication, JSON property transformation, STRUCT type handling, converter configuration, schema enforcement for data quality assurance

**Sync Strategies**: Full Sync, Mirror Sync, Append Only, Timestamp-based imports, Change Data Capture (CDC) for different data freshness and volume requirements

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

The integrations utilize several core Amplitude API endpoints:

**HTTP V2 API**: Primary ingestion endpoint for batch event uploads at `api.amplitude.com/2/httpapi` (US) and `api.eu.amplitude.com/2/httpapi` (EU)

**Attribution API**: Specialized endpoint for attribution data with advertising ID matching at dedicated attribution endpoints

**Batch Event Upload API**: High-volume event processing for enterprise-scale data ingestion

**User Privacy API**: GDPR/privacy compliance integration for automated data governance workflows

Common webhook endpoints follow regional patterns:
- US Region: `api.amplitude.com/[partner]`
- EU Region: `api.eu.amplitude.com/[partner]`

## Enterprise Features and Broader Product Ecosystem

Enterprise integrations support advanced capabilities including regional data residency with US/EU data center selection, schema enforcement for structured data validation, User Privacy API integration for automated compliance workflows, account-level reporting with group-level property mapping for B2B analytics, and custom SQL transformations for advanced data manipulation from warehouse sources.

The source catalog integrates with Amplitude's broader product ecosystem by feeding behavioral data into Amplitude Analytics for funnel and retention analysis, powering Amplitude Experiment for feature flagging and experimentation, enabling Amplitude Audiences for behavioral segmentation, and supporting Amplitude CDP for customer data platform capabilities. This creates a unified behavioral analytics foundation that connects data ingestion, analysis, experimentation, and activation across the entire customer lifecycle.
