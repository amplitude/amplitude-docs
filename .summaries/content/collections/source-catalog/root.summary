## Amplitude Source Catalog: Comprehensive Data Integration Ecosystem

Amplitude's Source Catalog represents a unified data integration platform that enables organizations to centralize behavioral analytics by ingesting data from over 60 diverse platforms and tools. The catalog spans marketing automation, attribution platforms, customer data platforms (CDPs), data warehouses, subscription management, experimentation tools, and customer engagement platforms, creating a comprehensive behavioral analytics hub.

## Integration Architecture and Data Flow Patterns

The source catalog operates on four foundational integration types that define data ingestion patterns:

**Raw-Events Integration** forms the primary data ingestion pattern, directly streaming event data from external platforms into Amplitude's analytics engine. This encompasses subscription events from RevenueCat and Adapty, survey responses from Sprig and Survicate, email engagement metrics from SendGrid and HubSpot, and user behavior data from platforms like Convizit and Tribe.

**Event-Streaming Integration** enables real-time bidirectional data flow, supporting both continuous data ingestion and cohort export capabilities. Key implementations include Braze Currents, Iterable, and OneSignal integrations that synchronize messaging campaign data while enabling behavioral cohort targeting for personalized customer experiences.

**Cohorts Integration** facilitates advanced audience segmentation by importing user groups from external platforms and exporting Amplitude-generated behavioral cohorts for targeted campaigns. This bidirectional capability is demonstrated in integrations with Mailchimp, Qualtrics, and Split, enabling closed-loop marketing optimization.

**Attribution Integration** leverages Amplitude's Attribution API to process mobile attribution data from platforms like Adjust, AppsFlyer, Branch, and Kochava. These integrations support advertising ID matching (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) with 72-hour attribution windows for comprehensive mobile marketing attribution analysis.

## Enterprise Data Warehouse Integration Framework

Enterprise-grade data warehouse integrations form the backbone of sophisticated ETL/reverse ETL workflows:

**Amazon S3 Import** provides comprehensive file-based ingestion supporting JSON, CSV, and Parquet formats with IAM role authentication. The integration implements converter configuration with both Mirror Sync and Append Only strategies, requiring specific bucket organization with date prefix formats (YYYY/MM/DD/HH) and supporting file sizes from 1MB to 1GB for scalable data processing.

**BigQuery Data Import** utilizes Google Cloud Storage bucket offloading with service account permissions including BigQuery Job User, BigQuery Data Viewer, and Storage Admin roles. The integration supports both time-based and full sync import methods with STRUCT data type handling and JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR transformations for complex data structure processing.

**Snowflake Integration** offers the most sophisticated data warehouse connectivity with four distinct import strategies: Full Sync, Timestamp-based, Append Only Sync, and Mirror Sync. It includes Change Data Capture (CDC) functionality, comprehensive SQL query configuration, and supports OBJECT_CONSTRUCT JSON transformation with JWT token authentication for enterprise security requirements.

**Databricks Integration** implements Change Data Feed (CDF) for delta sync capabilities, supporting both personal access token and service principal authentication with all-purpose compute cluster requirements for distributed data processing.

## Marketing Technology Stack Integration

The catalog extensively covers marketing technology integrations for comprehensive campaign analytics:

**Facebook Ads and Google Ads** integrations import campaign-level metrics as "Daily Ad Metrics" events, including properties like ad_metrics.impressions, ad_metrics.clicks, and campaign_id for customer acquisition cost (CAC) and return on ad spend (ROAS) calculations. Both platforms support UTM parameter handling and multi-account configurations for enterprise marketing operations.

**Google Analytics 4 (GA4)** integration operates through BigQuery linking with specific handling for GA4's export delays (72-hour daily, 24-hour streaming) and includes catch-up importing strategies for comprehensive web analytics data migration and cross-platform behavior analysis.

**Adobe Analytics** integration provides direct data import as raw events with specific field mappings including postvisidhigh/postvisidlow for user_id and custvisid for device_id, supporting cross-platform customer behavior tracking and analytics migration.

## Customer Engagement and Messaging Platform Ecosystem

Messaging and customer engagement integrations enable comprehensive communication analytics:

**Braze Integration** supports bidirectional data flow through Braze Currents, enabling both event import from Braze's messaging channels and cohort export for targeted campaigns. This creates a closed-loop system for comprehensive customer engagement analytics and behavioral targeting.

**Intercom Integration** synchronizes conversational data including conversation topics, contact topics, user topics, visitor topics, and event topics, all prefixed with "[Intercom]" for easy identification and analysis of customer support interactions alongside behavioral data.

**OneSignal Integration** captures messaging events (sent, clicked, viewed, confirmed delivery) across push notifications, email, SMS, and in-app channels while supporting cohort-based targeting for personalized messaging campaigns.

## Subscription and Revenue Analytics Framework

Subscription management integrations provide comprehensive monetization analytics:

**RevenueCat Integration** enables mobile app subscription tracking with behavioral cohort analysis and cross-platform subscription management, supporting both proceeds and revenue reporting methodologies for comprehensive subscription business analytics.

**Stripe Integration** imports revenue events via webhooks including payment_intent.succeeded, charge.succeeded, and invoice.payment_succeeded with user ID mapping priority and currency normalization for global revenue tracking and analysis.

**Adapty Integration** streams subscription monetization and in-app purchase events with specific user ID mapping requirements using amplitudeDeviceId and amplitudeUserId configuration for precise revenue attribution.

## Experimentation and Feature Management Integration

Feature flagging and experimentation platforms integrate for comprehensive product analytics:

**Split Integration** imports feature flag traffic impression data as get_treatment events, supporting experimentation tracking and cohort targeting with behavioral analysis of flag treatments for data-driven product development.

**Optimizely Integration** utilizes custom JSON analytics integration for syncing behavioral cohorts and experiment data, including campaign, experiment, and variation information through identify calls for comprehensive experimentation analysis.

**Taplytics Integration** exports mobile A/B testing data via the Attribution API, sending experiment variations as TL_experiments events for cross-platform testing analysis and optimization.

## User Experience and Feedback Analytics

User experience and feedback integrations enable qualitative data analysis:

**Sprig and Survicate Integrations** capture in-product survey responses including CSAT and NPS metrics as raw events, enabling correlation analysis between user satisfaction scores and behavioral metrics for comprehensive user experience optimization.

**Userflow and Userguiding Integrations** track onboarding analytics including Flow Started events and Checklist Task Completed events for analyzing user activation and retention funnels with detailed onboarding performance metrics.

**Chameleon Integration** sends product tour and guidance events for analyzing product adoption performance alongside behavioral data, enabling comprehensive user onboarding optimization.

## Tag Management and Implementation Framework

Tag management integrations provide flexible implementation options:

**Google Tag Manager** offers three distinct templates: current Browser SDK 2.0 template with autocapture capabilities, legacy template for backwards compatibility, and server-side template using HTTP V2 API for server-side data collection and privacy-compliant implementations.

**Tealium Integration** supports both iQ Tag Management (TIQ) and AudienceStream Universal Data Hub implementations for comprehensive customer data platform connectivity and real-time data orchestration.
