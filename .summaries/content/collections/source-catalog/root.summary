## Amplitude Source Catalog

Amplitude's Source Catalog is a comprehensive data integration ecosystem comprising over 70 connectors that enable organizations to centralize behavioral analytics by importing data from diverse platforms across their technology stack. The catalog serves as the primary data ingestion layer for Amplitude's analytics platform, supporting marketing automation, attribution platforms, customer data platforms, data warehouses, survey tools, and specialized analytics services.

## Product Architecture and Integration Relationships

The Source Catalog operates through four distinct integration patterns, each optimized for specific data types and use cases:

**Raw Events Integration** forms the foundation of the catalog, importing event data directly into Amplitude while preserving original event structures. This pattern enables cross-platform behavioral analysis through sources like Adobe Analytics, Google Analytics 4, HubSpot, and Braze, which stream user interactions, campaign events, and engagement metrics.

**Attribution API Integration** provides specialized handling for mobile attribution platforms including AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch, and Kochava. This integration type manages attribution data with specific requirements for Advertising ID (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) matching and enforces 72-hour attribution windows for accurate marketing performance measurement.

**Cohorts Integration** enables bidirectional data flow where behavioral cohorts created in Amplitude can be exported to marketing platforms like Braze, Iterable, and OneSignal for targeted campaign execution, while simultaneously supporting cohort-based data imports for closed-loop marketing optimization.

**Event Streaming Integration** facilitates real-time data synchronization between platforms, commonly utilized by customer engagement platforms and marketing automation tools to maintain synchronized user profiles and behavioral triggers across the technology stack.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Integration Types**: The catalog categorizes connectors into four primary types - `raw-events`, `event-streaming`, `cohorts`, and `attribution API` - which define data flow patterns and processing methods for different use cases.

**Authentication Methods**: Secure platform connections utilize multiple authentication patterns including OAuth, API key, Service Account, personal access tokens, and JWT authentication, each tailored to specific platform security requirements.

**Identity Resolution**: Cross-platform user tracking employs standardized identifiers including `user_id`, `device_id`, `amplitudeUserId`, `amplitudeDeviceId`, and `customerUserId` to enable unified customer journey analysis across fragmented touchpoints.

**Event Structure**: Behavioral data organization follows a consistent schema with `event_properties`, `user_properties`, and `group_properties` that structure data for analysis and segmentation across all integrated platforms.

**Sync Strategies**: Data synchronization accommodates different freshness and volume requirements through Full Sync, Mirror Sync, Append Only, and Timestamp-based import strategies, with Change Data Capture (CDC) capabilities for enterprise-scale operations.

**Regional Endpoints**: Data residency compliance utilizes region-specific endpoints with US (`api.amplitude.com`) and EU (`api.eu.amplitude.com`) options for GDPR and data sovereignty requirements.

## Data Warehouse and Enterprise Integration Ecosystem

The catalog includes sophisticated warehouse integrations supporting enterprise-scale data operations through three primary cloud platforms:

**BigQuery Integration** leverages Google Cloud's BigQuery with specialized handling for STRUCT type columns, JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR functions, and RECORD type REPEATED mode data structures. Implementation requires Service Account permissions including BigQuery Job User, BigQuery Data Viewer, and Storage Admin roles for comprehensive data lake access.

**Snowflake Integration** supports four distinct import strategies with Change Data Capture capabilities, OBJECT_CONSTRUCT functions for JSON handling, and key pair authentication for secure enterprise data transfer across different data freshness requirements.

**Databricks Integration** utilizes Databricks Change Data Feed (CDF) for delta sync operations with all-purpose compute clusters, personal access tokens, and Unity Catalog permissions for comprehensive data lake integration within the modern data stack.

File-based integrations through **Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage** enable batch data ingestion with converter configuration, IAM role setup, and support for JSON/CSV/parquet formats with date prefix organization requirements for structured data warehouse operations.

## Marketing Technology and Attribution Ecosystem

The catalog extensively covers marketing technology integrations across multiple categories:

**Advertising Platforms** including Facebook Ads, Google Ads, LinkedIn Ads, TikTok Ads, and X Ads import campaign-level metrics as "Daily Ad Metrics" events with standardized properties like `ad_metrics.impressions`, `ad_metrics.clicks`, `ad_metrics.cost`, `campaign_id`, and UTM parameters for Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) calculations.

**Mobile Attribution Platforms** including AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch, Kochava, and Singular provide real-time attribution data through the specialized Attribution API, supporting multi-touch attribution analysis and marketing channel performance optimization with strict 72-hour attribution windows.

**Email and Marketing Automation** platforms including HubSpot, Mailchimp, SendGrid, Braze, Iterable, and MoEngage capture email campaign events (sent, delivered, opened, clicked) and marketing automation workflows for comprehensive customer journey analysis across touchpoints.

**Customer Data Platforms** including Segment, mParticle, Tealium, and RudderStack enable centralized data collection and distribution, supporting both client-side bundled integration and server-side sources with SDK function mappings for track, identify, screen, alias, and group operations.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

The Source Catalog utilizes several core API endpoints for data ingestion and management:

- **HTTP V2 API**: Primary endpoint for event ingestion with batch upload capabilities and real-time processing
- **Attribution API**: Specialized endpoint for attribution data with real-time processing and mobile-specific requirements
- **Lookup Table API**: Enables CSV data import for property enrichment and cross-platform data mapping
- **User Privacy API**: Handles data privacy compliance, user data management, and GDPR requirements

Technical implementation supports both client-side (Browser SDK 2.0) and server-side (HTTP V2 API) integration patterns with autocapture events, UTM parameter tracking, and regional data residency options for compliance requirements.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The Source Catalog demonstrates Amplitude's position as a central analytics hub in the modern data stack through several key ecosystem patterns:

**Bidirectional Data Flow**: Many integrations support both data import to Amplitude and cohort export back to source platforms, creating closed-loop marketing and product optimization workflows that enable real-time personalization and campaign optimization.

**Reverse ETL Integration**: Hightouch and Census integrations enable operational analytics by syncing data warehouse data back to Amplitude, supporting real-time customer experience personalization and data activation across the technology stack.

**Specialized Analytics Tools**: The catalog includes survey platforms (Qualtrics, Sprig, Survicate), product experience tools (Chameleon, Userflow, Bento), and subscription platforms (RevenueCat, Stripe, Adapty) that capture qualitative feedback, product adoption metrics, and revenue analytics for comprehensive customer understanding.

**Cross-Platform Identity Resolution**: Standardized user ID mapping capabilities across all integrations enable unified customer journey analysis despite fragmented touchpoints, supporting comprehensive behavioral analytics across web, mobile, and offline channels.

The Source Catalog represents the foundational data ingestion layer that enables organizations to unify behavioral data from across their entire technology ecosystem, positioning Amplitude as the central nervous system for customer analytics and data-driven decision making in modern digital organizations.
