# Amplitude Source Catalog: Comprehensive Product Overview

## Product Overview

The Amplitude Source Catalog is a comprehensive collection of integrations that connect Amplitude's analytics platform with various third-party tools and data sources. Amplitude is a product analytics platform that helps businesses understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The Source Catalog enables organizations to import data from external sources into Amplitude for unified analytics and to export Amplitude data to other platforms for activation.

## Key Features and Concepts

1. **Data Import Capabilities**: Import events, user properties, and group properties from various sources including:
   - Data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks)
   - Cloud storage (Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage)
   - Customer Data Platforms (mParticle, Segment, RudderStack, Tealium)
   - Marketing platforms (Facebook Ads, Google Ads, Braze, HubSpot)
   - Subscription/payment services (Stripe, RevenueCat, Adapty)

2. **Bidirectional Data Flow**: Many integrations support two-way data sharing:
   - Ingest events from third-party platforms into Amplitude
   - Export Amplitude cohorts to other platforms for targeted actions
   - Stream Amplitude events to other platforms in real-time

3. **Attribution Tracking**: Dedicated integrations with mobile measurement platforms (AppsFlyer, Branch, Kochava, Singular) to connect marketing attribution data with product analytics.

4. **User Feedback Collection**: Integrations with survey and feedback tools (Sprig, Survicate, Qualtrics) to combine qualitative feedback with quantitative analytics.

5. **Subscription Analytics**: Specialized integrations for tracking in-app purchases and subscriptions (RevenueCat, Adapty, Nami) to analyze monetization metrics.

6. **User Engagement Tools**: Connections with onboarding, messaging, and engagement platforms (Userflow, Userguiding, OneSignal, Intercom) to analyze the effectiveness of user communications.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Source Catalog fits into Amplitude's broader product ecosystem as follows:

1. **Data Collection Layer**: Source integrations serve as data collection mechanisms, complementing Amplitude's native SDKs by bringing in data from third-party platforms.

2. **Data Processing Pipeline**: Imported data flows through Amplitude's processing pipeline, where it's transformed, deduplicated, and prepared for analysis.

3. **Analytics Core**: Once data is processed, it becomes available in Amplitude's analytics tools (Amplitude Analytics) for creating charts, dashboards, and insights.

4. **Activation Layer**: Processed data and derived insights can be exported to other platforms through cohort integrations for targeted marketing, personalization, and engagement.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Raw Events**: Unprocessed event data sent to Amplitude from integrated platforms.

2. **Cohorts**: Groups of users who share common behaviors or attributes, which can be exported to other platforms for targeted actions.

3. **User Properties**: Attributes associated with individual users that persist across sessions (e.g., demographics, subscription status).

4. **Group Properties**: Attributes associated with organizations or accounts for account-level analytics.

5. **Attribution API**: Amplitude's API for receiving attribution data from mobile measurement platforms.

6. **Mirror Sync**: An import strategy that maintains data consistency between the source and Amplitude by reflecting all changes (inserts, updates, deletes).

7. **Append Only Sync**: An import strategy that only adds new data without updating or deleting existing records.

8. **Change Data Feed (CDF)**: A mechanism used in data warehouse integrations to capture and import only changed data.

9. **User ID Mapping**: The process of matching user identifiers between Amplitude and third-party platforms.

10. **API Key**: Authentication credential required to establish connections between Amplitude and third-party platforms.

## Integration Types and Patterns

The Source Catalog includes several distinct integration patterns:

1. **Event Streaming Integrations**: Real-time sending of events from third-party platforms to Amplitude (e.g., Braze, OneSignal, Intercom).

2. **Data Warehouse Imports**: Scheduled imports from data warehouses with SQL query configuration (Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks).

3. **Cloud Storage Imports**: File-based imports from cloud storage platforms with converter configurations (S3, GCS).

4. **Cohort Export Integrations**: Sending Amplitude user segments to other platforms for targeting (e.g., Braze, HubSpot, OneSignal).

5. **Attribution Integrations**: Specialized connections with mobile measurement platforms using the Attribution API.

6. **Tag Manager Integrations**: Client-side data collection through tag management systems (Google Tag Manager).

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

Many integrations utilize specific API endpoints and implementation patterns:

1. **HTTP V2 API**: Used by server-side integrations to send events to Amplitude.
   - Endpoint: `https://api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`
   - EU Data Residency: `https://api.eu.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`

2. **Attribution API**: Used by attribution partners to send attribution data.
   - Endpoint: `https://api.amplitude.com/attribution`

3. **Cohort API**: Used to export cohorts to third-party platforms.
   - Endpoint: `https://amplitude.com/api/2/cohorts`

4. **Lookup Table API**: Used to create and manage lookup tables for data enrichment.
   - Endpoint: `https://amplitude.com/api/2/lookuptables`

5. **Common Implementation Patterns**:
   - OAuth authentication for user-friendly connections
   - API key authentication for server-side integrations
   - Webhook configurations for event streaming
   - SQL query configurations for data warehouse imports
   - Service account permissions for cloud storage access
