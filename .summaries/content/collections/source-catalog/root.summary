## Product Overview

Amplitude's Source Catalog is a comprehensive data integration ecosystem comprising over 60 connectors that enable organizations to centralize behavioral analytics by ingesting data from diverse platforms across their technology stack. The catalog transforms external platform data into Amplitude's unified event schema, creating a centralized hub for cross-platform behavioral analysis spanning marketing automation, attribution tracking, customer engagement, subscription management, data warehouses, and experimentation platforms.

## Integration Architecture and Product Relationships

The Source Catalog operates on four fundamental integration patterns that define data flow relationships:

**Raw-Events Integration** forms the backbone of the catalog, directly ingesting event data from external platforms into Amplitude projects through real-time streaming and batch processing. This integration type transforms platform-specific events into Amplitude's standardized event schema.

**Event-Streaming Integration** enables bidirectional data flow, supporting both data ingestion and export capabilities. This creates closed-loop analytics workflows where Amplitude-generated insights can trigger actions in connected external systems.

**Cohorts Integration** facilitates behavioral segment sharing, allowing organizations to export Amplitude's advanced user segmentation to external platforms for targeted campaigns and personalized experiences.

**Attribution Integration** leverages Amplitude's Attribution API to ingest marketing attribution data, requiring specific advertising ID matching (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) and attribution window configurations.

The catalog's integrations are categorized into distinct product families: data warehouse connectors (Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks), marketing attribution platforms (AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch), customer engagement tools (Intercom, Braze, OneSignal), subscription management systems (RevenueCat, Stripe), and experimentation platforms (Optimizely, Split).

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Mirror Sync**: Real-time data synchronization using Change Data Capture (CDC) mechanisms supporting INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations for maintaining data consistency between warehouses and Amplitude.

**Append Only Sync**: Batch processing strategy optimized for append-only data patterns, designed for high-volume event ingestion scenarios.

**Time-based Import**: Incremental data processing leveraging monotonically increasing timestamps to reduce computational overhead and enable near real-time analytics.

**Attribution API**: Specialized endpoint for ingesting marketing attribution data with advertising ID matching requirements and configurable attribution windows (commonly 72 hours).

**Daily Ad Metrics Events**: Campaign-level metric imports from advertising platforms providing properties like ad_metrics.impressions, ad_metrics.clicks, and ad_metrics.cost for CAC/ROAS calculations.

**Partner-maintained vs Amplitude-maintained**: Integration classification distinguishing between connectors managed by external partners (requiring coordination with Customer Success Managers) and those maintained directly by Amplitude.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The Source Catalog positions Amplitude as the central analytics hub within organizations' customer data platforms. Data warehouse integrations create upstream data pipelines from enterprise data infrastructure, while marketing platform integrations provide downstream activation capabilities through cohort export functionality.

The catalog supports comprehensive customer journey analytics by connecting touchpoints across acquisition (attribution platforms), engagement (email marketing, push notifications), product experience (onboarding tools, feature flags), monetization (subscription platforms), and feedback collection (survey tools).

Regional data residency requirements are addressed through dual endpoint support for US (api.amplitude.com) and EU (api.eu.amplitude.com) deployments, ensuring GDPR compliance and data governance requirements are met across the integration ecosystem.

## Technical Implementation Specifications

**Authentication**: Consistent authentication patterns using Amplitude project API keys with regional endpoint configuration for data residency compliance.

**Event Naming Conventions**: Platform-specific prefixes (e.g., "[Intercom]", "[Mailchimp]", "[Sendgrid]") distinguish source systems while maintaining Amplitude's standard event property structure.

**User ID Mapping**: Critical configuration requirement across integrations ensuring proper identity resolution between platforms, particularly important for revenue attribution and cross-platform user journey analysis.

**Webhook Configurations**: Email marketing platforms and payment processors utilize webhook endpoints for real-time event streaming, with specific event types like payment_intent.succeeded, charge.succeeded, and email engagement events.

**Service Account Permissions**: Data warehouse integrations require specific IAM configurations including BigQuery Job User, BigQuery Data Viewer, and Storage Admin roles for proper data access and transformation capabilities.

**Attribution API Endpoint**: Specialized endpoint for marketing attribution data ingestion with advertising ID matching requirements and privacy considerations for iOS 14.5+ App Tracking Transparency compliance.

The Source Catalog enables organizations to create unified customer data platforms where behavioral data from across the customer journey flows into Amplitude's analytics engine, maintaining data quality, privacy compliance, and analytical consistency while supporting both real-time and batch processing patterns across diverse integration types.
