Amplitude's Source Catalog is a comprehensive data integration ecosystem that enables businesses to centralize customer data from over 70 platforms into Amplitude's behavioral analytics infrastructure. The catalog serves as the primary data ingestion layer, transforming disparate customer touchpoints across marketing, product, and revenue systems into unified behavioral insights.

## Integration Architecture and Data Flow Models

The source catalog operates on four primary integration patterns that define data movement into Amplitude:

**Raw Events Integration** forms the core ingestion mechanism, streaming behavioral events, transactions, and user interactions directly into Amplitude's analytics pipeline. This pattern handles high-volume event data from platforms like Braze, HubSpot, Intercom, and mobile attribution providers, maintaining event-level granularity for behavioral analysis.

**Cohorts Integration** enables bidirectional data synchronization, allowing Amplitude-generated behavioral cohorts to be exported for targeted campaigns while importing external audience segments back into Amplitude for enhanced user segmentation and cross-platform journey analysis.

**Event Streaming** provides real-time data synchronization critical for attribution providers (AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch) that require immediate user matching within attribution windows and real-time campaign optimization.

**Attribution API Integration** specifically handles mobile attribution data with strict requirements for Advertising ID matching (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) and 72-hour attribution windows for accurate user correlation across acquisition channels.

## Enterprise Data Warehouse Ecosystem

The catalog's warehouse integrations support enterprise-scale data operations through sophisticated ETL/ELT patterns:

**Cloud Data Warehouses** (BigQuery, Snowflake, Databricks) feature advanced capabilities including Change Data Capture (CDC), Mirror Sync versus Append Only strategies, and complex SQL transformations for handling STRUCT types and JSON properties fields. These integrations support full mutation operations (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) and require specific IAM roles, service account configurations, and schema management protocols.

**Reverse ETL Platforms** (Census, Hightouch, RudderStack) create closed-loop data ecosystems by syncing warehouse-processed data back into Amplitude as raw events, enabling operational analytics and data activation workflows.

**Cloud Storage Integrations** (Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage) provide file-based ingestion with converter configurations supporting JSON/CSV/parquet formats, requiring specific folder structures with YYYY/MM/DD/HH date prefixes for automated batch processing.

## Marketing Technology and Attribution Infrastructure

The catalog extensively covers marketing attribution and advertising platforms through specialized integration patterns:

**Advertising Platforms** (Facebook Ads, Google Ads, LinkedIn Ads, TikTok Ads, X Ads) import campaign-level metrics as "Daily Ad Metrics" events with standardized properties including `ad_metrics.impressions`, `ad_metrics.clicks`, and `ad_metrics.cost`. These integrations enable Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) calculations through UTM parameter tracking and campaign attribution modeling.

**Mobile Attribution Providers** utilize Amplitude's Attribution API for real-time user attribution with strict Advertising ID matching requirements and attribution event holding periods, enabling accurate mobile app install attribution and post-install event correlation.

**Email and Messaging Platforms** (SendGrid, Mailchimp, OneSignal) track engagement metrics across communication channels with standardized event prefixes and user ID mapping via platform-specific unique parameters.

## Customer Experience and Product Analytics Integration

The catalog includes comprehensive coverage of customer experience and product analytics tools:

**Customer Engagement Platforms** (Braze, Intercom, Cordial, MoEngage) support bidirectional data flow, enabling personalized messaging campaigns based on Amplitude behavioral cohorts while importing engagement events for comprehensive customer journey analysis.

**User Onboarding and Product Experience** platforms (Userflow, Userguiding, Chameleon, Bento) track in-app guidance events, product tour completions, and onboarding funnel progression, providing product teams with detailed user adoption analytics.

**Survey and Feedback Platforms** (Qualtrics, Sprig, Survicate, Blitzllama) import qualitative feedback data for correlation with quantitative behavioral analytics, enabling Voice of Customer analysis within the behavioral analytics framework.

## Subscription Economy and Revenue Analytics

Specialized integrations handle subscription and revenue data through dedicated patterns:

**Subscription Management Platforms** (RevenueCat, Adapty, Apphud, Nami) stream subscription lifecycle events, revenue data, and in-app purchase analytics with user ID matching requirements between platforms, enabling comprehensive subscription funnel analysis and churn prediction.

**Payment Processing** integrations like Stripe import revenue events via webhook configurations supporting `payment_intent.succeeded`, `invoice.payment_succeeded`, and other financial transaction events for revenue attribution and customer lifetime value calculations.

## Technical Implementation Framework

### Authentication and Security
**API Key Authentication** serves as the primary authentication method across most integrations, with platform-specific variations including OAuth 2.0 flows for enterprise platforms requiring enhanced security protocols.

### Data Mapping and Correlation
**User ID Mapping** requires precise alignment between platform identifiers (customerUserId, amplitudeUserId, Identity ID) to enable accurate cross-platform user journey tracking and behavioral correlation.

**Event Properties and User Properties** follow Amplitude's HTTP V2 API specification with JSON field mapping for custom attributes, ensuring consistent data structure across all integrated platforms.

**Insert ID Deduplication** prevents duplicate event ingestion across multiple data sources and batch imports, maintaining data integrity in high-volume environments.

### Integration Ownership Model
**Partner-Maintained vs Amplitude-Maintained** designations indicate integration ownership, support responsibility, and update cadence, affecting implementation planning and ongoing maintenance requirements.

## Enterprise Compliance and Data Governance

The catalog includes enterprise-grade capabilities for regulatory compliance:

**EU Data Residency** support across multiple integrations ensures GDPR compliance through region-specific API endpoints (api.eu.amplitude.com) and data processing controls.

**User Privacy API Integration** enables automated data deletion and privacy compliance across warehouse sources, supporting right-to-be-forgotten requirements and data subject access requests.

**Schema Enforcement** ensures data quality and consistency across imported events and properties, preventing data corruption and maintaining analytical accuracy.

## Implementation Patterns and Technical Requirements

### Real-time vs Batch Processing
**Webhook Configuration** enables real-time event streaming from platforms like Stripe, SendGrid, and Mailchimp directly to Amplitude endpoints, supporting immediate behavioral analysis and real-time personalization.

**Batch Processing** handles daily imports for advertising platforms and warehouse sources, optimizing for data completeness over real-time availability.

### SDK Integration Requirements
Many integrations require dual SDK implementation where platforms need both source platform SDKs and Amplitude SDKs for proper user matching and event correlation, particularly critical for mobile attribution and customer engagement platforms.

### Performance and Scale Management
**Event Volume Quotas** impact integration selection and data flow management, requiring careful planning for high-volume sources and batch processing windows.

The Source Catalog represents Amplitude's comprehensive approach to creating unified customer data platforms that combine behavioral analytics with marketing attribution, revenue tracking, and customer engagement metrics. This integration ecosystem enables businesses to build complete customer journey analytics spanning acquisition, activation, engagement, retention, and revenue across all customer touchpoints and platforms.
