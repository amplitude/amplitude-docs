## Amplitude Source Catalog: Comprehensive Data Integration Ecosystem

Amplitude's Source Catalog is a comprehensive data integration platform that centralizes behavioral analytics by ingesting data from over 60 diverse external platforms and tools. The catalog serves as the primary mechanism for organizations to unify customer journey data from acquisition through conversion, enabling comprehensive behavioral analytics across marketing automation, attribution platforms, customer data platforms, subscription management, survey tools, experimentation platforms, and data warehouses.

## Integration Architecture and Data Flow Models

The source catalog operates on four fundamental integration paradigms that define data movement patterns:

**Raw-Events Integration** functions as the core ingestion mechanism, transforming external platform events into Amplitude's standardized event schema. This integration maintains original event properties while mapping to Amplitude's user_id, device_id, and event_properties structure, supporting both real-time streaming and batch processing workflows.

**Event-Streaming Integration** enables bidirectional data exchange, allowing platforms to simultaneously send behavioral data to Amplitude and receive processed behavioral cohorts for downstream marketing automation and personalization campaigns.

**Cohorts Integration** facilitates the export of Amplitude's behavioral segments to external platforms, enabling targeted marketing campaigns, personalization engines, and customer engagement workflows based on behavioral analytics insights.

**Attribution Integration** leverages Amplitude's Attribution API to ingest marketing attribution data with standardized 72-hour attribution windows and advertising ID matching (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) for mobile attribution analysis.

## Data Warehouse Integration Ecosystem

The catalog provides sophisticated warehouse integrations supporting multiple data import strategies and authentication mechanisms:

**Amazon S3 Import** implements bucket-based ingestion with IAM role authentication, supporting Mirror Sync and Append Only import strategies. The integration includes converter configuration for JSON/CSV/parquet formats with chronological file ordering requirements for temporal data consistency.

**BigQuery Data Import** utilizes Google Cloud Storage bucket offloading with Service Account permissions requiring BigQuery Job User, BigQuery Data Viewer, and Storage Admin roles. The integration supports time-based and full sync import methods with STRUCT data type handling and JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR transformations for nested data processing.

**Snowflake Integration** implements Change Data Capture (CDC) functionality with four distinct import strategies: Full Sync, Timestamp-based sync, Append Only Sync, and Mirror Sync. The integration utilizes OBJECT_CONSTRUCT SQL functions and VARIANT JSON data types with key pair authentication for secure data transfer.

**Databricks Integration** employs Change Data Feed (CDF) for delta sync capabilities, supporting personal access token authentication and Unity Catalog permissions with all-purpose compute cluster requirements for data processing workflows.

## Marketing Attribution and Campaign Analytics

The catalog extensively covers marketing attribution and campaign performance analytics through specialized integrations:

**Advertising Platform Integration** includes Facebook Ads and Google Ads integrations that import campaign-level metrics as "Daily Ad Metrics" events. These integrations capture ad_metrics.impressions, ad_metrics.clicks, and ad_metrics.cost properties essential for Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) calculations.

**Mobile Attribution Platforms** including AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch, Kochava, and Singular utilize the Attribution API for mobile attribution data ingestion with ADID matching and standardized 72-hour attribution windows for accurate campaign performance measurement.

**Marketing Automation Platforms** such as Braze, HubSpot, Iterable, Leanplum, and MoEngage support bidirectional integration patterns, enabling both campaign event ingestion and behavioral cohort targeting for personalized marketing campaigns.

## Customer Data Platform and Tag Management Integration

**Segment Integration** provides comprehensive bidirectional data flow through the Amplitude (Actions) destination, supporting both client-side bundled integration and server-side sources. The integration includes SDK function mappings for track, identify, screen, alias, and group functions, enabling complete customer data unification.

**Google Tag Manager** offers multiple implementation pathways including client-side Browser SDK 2.0 template, server-side HTTP V2 API template, and legacy maintenance SDK template. The integration includes breaking changes documentation for migration paths between SDK versions.

**Unified Customer Data Platforms** including mParticle, Tealium, and RudderStack enable raw event streaming from unified customer data infrastructure, providing centralized data governance and quality control for behavioral analytics.

## Subscription and Revenue Analytics Integration

**Mobile Subscription Management Platforms** including RevenueCat, Adapty, Apphud, and Nami provide comprehensive mobile app subscription event tracking with revenue analytics and behavioral cohort analysis capabilities for subscription business models.

**Payment Processing Integration** through Stripe imports revenue events via webhook configurations, supporting payment_intent.succeeded, charge.succeeded, and invoice.payment_succeeded events with user ID mapping priority and currency normalization for global revenue tracking.

## Survey and Feedback Data Integration

**Qualitative Feedback Platforms** including Qualtrics, Sprig, Survicate, and Blitzllama enable survey response data ingestion as raw events with automatic email-based User_ID mapping and satisfaction-based cohort creation for customer experience analytics.

## Experimentation and Feature Flag Integration

**A/B Testing Platforms** including Optimizely, Split, and Taplytics provide experiment data ingestion through custom analytics integrations, traffic impression data import, and experiment variation tracking with behavioral cohort targeting for experimentation analysis.

## Technical Implementation Specifications

**Authentication Mechanisms** vary by platform integration, including OAuth 2.0 flows, API key authentication, service account permissions, and webhook configurations with specific endpoint requirements supporting both US and EU data residency compliance.

**User Identity Resolution** represents a critical integration requirement, with platforms supporting various mapping strategies including email fallback mechanisms, device ID synchronization, and custom identifier matching through amplitudeDeviceId and customerUserId parameters.

**Data Delivery Patterns** range from real-time streaming to batch processing with platform-specific intervals including 30-minute, hourly, and daily batch processing depending on platform capabilities and data volume considerations.

**Regional Compliance Features** include EU data residency support, regional IP allowlisting requirements, and data center selection (US/EU) for compliance with GDPR and other data governance requirements.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Source Catalog integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics platform through several key touchpoints:

- **Attribution API** for marketing attribution data ingestion with standardized attribution windows
- **HTTP V2 API** for server-side event ingestion and real-time data streaming
- **Browser SDK 2.0** for client-side behavioral event tracking and user identification
- **Cohorts API** for behavioral segment export to external marketing and personalization platforms

The catalog enables organizations to create comprehensive customer journey analytics by unifying data across the entire customer lifecycle: acquisition data from attribution platforms, engagement metrics from marketing automation tools, conversion events from subscription management systems, satisfaction insights from survey platforms, and optimization data from experimentation tools, all centralized within Amplitude's behavioral analytics platform for unified customer intelligence and decision-making.
