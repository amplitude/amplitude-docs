Amplitude's Source Catalog is a comprehensive data ingestion ecosystem comprising over 60 integrations that enable organizations to centralize behavioral analytics data from diverse platforms including marketing automation, attribution platforms, customer data platforms, data warehouses, experimentation tools, and specialized analytics services.

## Core Integration Architecture

The catalog operates on four fundamental integration patterns that define data flow mechanisms:

**Raw-Events Integration** serves as the primary ingestion mechanism for streaming event data directly into Amplitude projects while preserving original event structures and properties. This supports real-time behavioral data, user actions, and system events from external platforms.

**Event-Streaming Integration** enables bidirectional data flow, allowing platforms to both send events to Amplitude and receive processed data for enhanced targeting and personalization workflows.

**Cohorts Integration** facilitates export of Amplitude's behavioral cohorts to external platforms for targeted marketing campaigns, personalization engines, and customer engagement workflows.

**Attribution Integration** leverages Amplitude's Attribution API to ingest marketing attribution data with 72-hour attribution windows and advertising ID (IDFA/IDFV/ADID) matching requirements.

## Data Warehouse and ETL Ecosystem

Enterprise-scale warehouse integrations support sophisticated data operations:

**Amazon S3 Import** provides bucket-based ingestion with IAM role authentication, converter configuration, and Mirror Sync versus Append Only strategies. Supports JSON/CSV/parquet formats with 1MB-1GB file size requirements and chronological ordering.

**BigQuery Data Import** utilizes Google Cloud Storage bucket offloading with service account permissions (BigQuery Job User, BigQuery Data Viewer, Storage Admin roles). Features time-based import methods, full sync operations, and STRUCT data type handling with JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR transformations.

**Snowflake Integration** offers the most sophisticated warehouse connectivity with four import strategies: Full Sync, Timestamp, Append Only Sync, and Mirror Sync. Supports Change Data Capture (CDC), key pair authentication, and VARIANT JSON data types with OBJECT_CONSTRUCT functions.

**Databricks Integration** leverages Change Data Feed (CDF) for delta sync operations, requiring all-purpose compute clusters and personal access tokens with Unity Catalog permissions.

## Marketing Attribution and Campaign Analytics

Extensive coverage of marketing attribution platforms includes:

**Facebook Ads and Google Ads** import campaign-level metrics as "Daily Ad Metrics" events, including ad_metrics.impressions, ad_metrics.clicks, and UTM parameter mapping for CAC/ROAS calculations through batch ingestion.

**Attribution Platforms** (AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch, Kochava, Singular) utilize Amplitude's Attribution API for mobile attribution data with ADID matching and 72-hour attribution windows.

**Email Marketing Platforms** (HubSpot, Mailchimp, SendGrid, Braze) provide email campaign event tracking including EMAIL_SENT, EMAIL_DELIVERED, EMAIL_OPEN, and EMAIL_CLICK events with OAuth authentication and hourly sync intervals.

## Customer Data Platform Integration

CDP integrations enable comprehensive customer data unification:

**Segment Integration** provides bidirectional data flow through the Amplitude (Actions) destination, supporting client-side bundled integration, server-side sources, and SDK function mappings for track, identify, screen, alias, and group operations.

**mParticle, RudderStack, and Tealium** enable cross-platform data aggregation supporting Android, iOS, Unity, and JavaScript SDKs for comprehensive customer journey tracking.

## Subscription and Revenue Analytics

Specialized integrations focus on monetization tracking:

**RevenueCat and Adapty** provide mobile app subscription event tracking with behavioral cohort analysis and cross-platform subscription management.

**Stripe Integration** imports revenue events via webhooks, supporting payment_intent.succeeded, charge.succeeded, and invoice.payment_succeeded events with user ID mapping priority and currency normalization.

**Nami Integration** offers no-code paywall analytics for subscription management across mobile apps and connected TV devices.

## Experimentation and Feature Management

Sophisticated experimentation platform integrations include:

**Optimizely Integration** syncs behavioral cohorts and sends experiment data through custom JSON analytics integration with track_layer_decision functions and campaignId decision objects.

**Split Integration** imports feature flag traffic impression data with get_treatment events, supporting experimentation tracking and cohort targeting for Impact-Driven Development workflows.

**Taplytics Integration** exports mobile A/B testing experiment data using the Attribution API endpoint, sending TL_experiments events with experiment-to-variation mappings.

## User Experience and Feedback Platforms

Qualitative user feedback and onboarding analytics integrations:

**Survey Platforms** (Qualtrics, Sprig, Survicate, Blitzllama) provide survey response data ingestion with automatic email-based User_ID mapping and GPT-powered feedback analytics.

**Onboarding Platforms** (Userflow, Userguiding, Bento, Chameleon, Candu) track product tour events, step completion, and guide engagement metrics for user activation pattern analysis.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Mirror Sync vs Append Only**: Mirror Sync replicates exact warehouse state while Append Only continuously adds new records without deletion.

**Change Data Capture (CDC)**: Technology enabling real-time data synchronization by capturing and applying data changes.

**Attribution Window**: Time period (typically 72 hours) during which attribution platforms can match user actions to marketing touchpoints.

**Behavioral Cohorts**: User segments defined by specific behavioral patterns within Amplitude, exportable to external platforms for targeting.

**Event Streaming**: Bidirectional data flow enabling both ingestion and export of behavioral data between platforms.

## Technical Implementation Patterns

Common implementation patterns include:

**Authentication Methods**: API key configuration, OAuth flows, service account permissions, webhook authentication with US/EU data center support.

**User ID Mapping**: Ensures data consistency between platforms, supporting email addresses, device IDs, and custom identifiers.

**Event Naming Conventions**: Platform-specific prefixes (e.g., "[Intercom]", "[Mailchimp]", "[Sendgrid]") distinguish event sources within unified streams.

**Data Transformation**: Field mapping, property enrichment, and schema enforcement for maintaining data quality across diverse source systems.

The Source Catalog represents Amplitude's comprehensive data democratization approach, enabling unified behavioral analytics ecosystems spanning the complete customer journey from acquisition through retention and monetization.
