The Node.js SDK collection provides comprehensive analytics tracking capabilities for Node.js applications through Amplitude's analytics platform. The SDK ecosystem consists of two primary components: the core Node.js SDK for direct event tracking and the Ampli Wrapper for strongly-typed, schema-enforced analytics implementation.

## Core SDK Architecture

The collection centers around two main SDK versions: the legacy `@amplitude/node` SDK and the current `@amplitude/analytics-node` SDK. The current SDK represents a significant architectural evolution, transitioning from middleware-based event processing to a plugin-based architecture that supports both enrichment and destination plugins through `EnrichmentPlugin` and `DestinationPlugin` interfaces.

The core SDK (`@amplitude/analytics-node`) provides fundamental analytics capabilities including event tracking via the `track()` method, user identification through `identify()`, group analytics with `groupIdentify()`, and revenue tracking through a dedicated Revenue interface. The SDK communicates with Amplitude's HTTP V2 API, supporting both individual event submission and batch processing through the Batch API endpoint.

## Ampli Wrapper Integration

The Ampli Wrapper (`@amplitude/ampli`) builds upon the core SDK to provide strongly-typed analytics implementation based on Amplitude Data tracking plans. This wrapper generates type-safe APIs that enforce event schemas at development time, supporting both JavaScript and TypeScript applications with JSDoc type checking. The wrapper maintains the same core methods as the underlying SDK (`ampli.load()`, `ampli.identify()`, `ampli.track()`, `ampli.flush()`, `ampli.setGroup()`) while adding compile-time validation and code generation capabilities.

## Key Configuration and Operational Parameters

The SDK provides extensive configuration options for production deployment including `flushIntervalMillis` for controlling event batching frequency, `flushQueueSize` for managing memory usage, `flushMaxRetries` for handling network failures, and `serverZone` settings for EU/US data residency compliance. The system supports both individual event transmission and batch processing through the `useBatch` configuration parameter.

User identification requires either `user_id` or `device_id` parameters with configurable minimum length validation through `minIdLength`. The SDK supports advanced user property management through Identify operations including `set`, `setOnce`, `add`, `prepend`, `append`, `preInsert`, `postInsert`, and `remove` operations for granular user profile management.

## CLI and Development Workflow

The Ampli CLI provides essential development commands including `ampli pull` for generating strongly-typed tracking code from Amplitude Data tracking plans and `ampli status` for verifying implementation compliance. These commands integrate with the development workflow to ensure analytics implementation matches the defined tracking schema.

## Plugin Architecture and Extensibility

The current SDK implements a sophisticated plugin system supporting `PluginType.ENRICHMENT` for event data enhancement and `PluginType.DESTINATION` for custom event routing. This architecture replaces the legacy middleware system, providing more flexible event processing capabilities with support for custom `transportProvider` and `storageProvider` implementations.

## Migration and Compatibility

The collection includes comprehensive migration guidance for transitioning from the legacy `@amplitude/node` SDK to `@amplitude/analytics-node`, detailing API changes including the shift from `logEvent()` to `track()`, updated `identify()` signatures, and the conversion from middleware chains to plugin architecture. The Ampli Wrapper also supports migration from legacy `@amplitude/node` runtime to the current analytics infrastructure.

## API Endpoints and Network Configuration

The SDK communicates with Amplitude's analytics infrastructure through `api2.amplitude.com` endpoints, supporting both the HTTP V2 API for individual events and batch API endpoints for high-volume event processing. The system provides configurable `serverUrl` parameters for EU data residency requirements and custom deployment scenarios.
