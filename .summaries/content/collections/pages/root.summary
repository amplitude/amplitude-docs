# Amplitude Digital Analytics Platform

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and product intelligence platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive data-driven decision making. The platform consists of four core products: Analytics, Data, Experiment, and Session Replay, all built around a unified data foundation that enables cohesive product intelligence across the entire user journey.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem operates through four interconnected products that share user identification, event data, and analytics infrastructure:

**Amplitude Analytics** functions as the core behavioral analytics engine, providing user journey insights through event tracking and custom analysis capabilities. It serves as the foundation for understanding user interactions and product performance.

**Amplitude Data** operates as the central data integration layer, enabling bidirectional connections with data warehouses and external systems to centralize product data across organizations. This creates a unified data foundation that powers all other platform components.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers feature flag management and A/B testing capabilities, allowing teams to safely deploy and test new features with controlled user segments. It integrates directly with the analytics layer to measure experiment impact.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user session recordings, providing visual insights into user interactions and behavior patterns specifically for web applications. This complements the quantitative analytics with qualitative behavioral data.

These products work together through shared data models and user identification systems, creating a cohesive platform where insights from one product inform decisions in others.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Event Properties vs User Properties**: The platform maintains a critical distinction between event-level attributes that describe specific user actions and user-level attributes that describe persistent user characteristics across sessions.

**User Identification System**: Uses `user_id` and `device_id` parameters for tracking users across sessions and devices, enabling cohort analysis and comprehensive user journey mapping.

**Session Replay Components**: Browser-based tracking components, specifically the `@amplitude/session-replay-browser` package, designed for web application user interaction capture.

**SDK Initialization**: Utilizes boot methods such as `amplitudeEngagement.boot()` with configuration objects like `AmplitudeBootOptions` to initialize tracking across different platforms and environments.

**Custom Formulas**: Advanced analytics capabilities that extend beyond standard event counting, allowing users to create sophisticated custom calculations and metrics.

**Blueprint System**: Template-based content management architecture using structured templates for consistent documentation and interface layouts.

## Integration Points and Implementation

The platform provides multiple SDK and API integration methods:

**Browser SDK 2**: The primary web SDK for client-side event tracking and session replay implementation, supporting both basic and advanced initialization patterns with flexible configuration options.

**Swift SDK**: Mobile SDK for iOS applications that follows similar initialization patterns using `AmplitudeBootOptions` for platform-specific configuration.

**Data Warehouse Integration**: Enterprise-grade direct connections enabling bidirectional data flow between Amplitude and existing data infrastructure for advanced analytics workflows.

**API and SDK Architecture**: Maintains separate documentation sections for Amplitude APIs (server-side integrations) and Amplitude SDKs (client-side implementations), indicating clear separation of concerns between programmatic access and embedded tracking.

The SDKs support flexible configuration through options objects that handle user properties mapping, device identification, and session management across different platforms and environments.

## Global Product Ecosystem

Amplitude operates as a global platform with comprehensive internationalization support:

**Localization Framework**: Implements sophisticated content management with region-specific documentation portals, including dedicated Japanese localization with `jp-home.md` entry points and localized navigation systems.

**Content Management System**: Features UUID-based content identification, publishing workflows with draft and published states, origin tracking for translation management, and integrated SEO controls through sitemap configuration.

**Multi-Regional Strategy**: Maintains content consistency across global markets while accommodating local language requirements and cultural preferences through customizable interface elements and region-specific user experience controls.

The platform's documentation architecture supports comprehensive developer resources across multiple languages while maintaining synchronization with global product updates and feature releases, ensuring consistent access to analytics capabilities, SDK implementations, and data management workflows regardless of geographic location.
