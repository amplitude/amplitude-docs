## Core Products and Features

1. **Amplitude Analytics** - The flagship product for tracking and analyzing user behavior across digital products.
2. **Amplitude Data** - A data management solution for integrating, processing, and preparing analytics data.
3. **Amplitude Experiment** - A feature flagging and experimentation platform for testing product changes.
4. **Amplitude Session Replay** - A tool for capturing and reviewing actual user sessions to understand behavior in context.

### Key Capabilities
- Event tracking and user property management
- SDK implementation across multiple platforms
- Custom analysis features and formulas
- User identification and cohort analysis
- Feature flag management and A/B testing
- Data integration with external systems

## Product Relationships and Ecosystem

The Amplitude platform is built around a central data infrastructure that connects all products:

- **Analytics** serves as the core analysis engine, consuming data from various sources
- **Data** provides the integration layer for bringing information into the Amplitude ecosystem
- **Experiment** leverages user data from Analytics to target and measure experiments
- **Session Replay** adds qualitative context to the quantitative data in Analytics

These products are designed to work together seamlessly while also functioning independently based on customer needs.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Events** - User actions tracked within digital products
- **User Properties** - Attributes associated with users that persist across sessions
- **Cohorts** - Groups of users who share common behaviors or attributes
- **Feature Flags** - Toggles that enable/disable features for specific users
- **SDKs (Software Development Kits)** - Libraries for implementing Amplitude in various platforms
- **APIs** - Programmatic interfaces for interacting with Amplitude services

## Technical Implementation

### SDKs
Amplitude provides SDKs for various platforms to implement tracking in applications. These SDKs handle event batching, user identification, and data transmission to Amplitude servers.

### APIs
Amplitude offers several APIs for programmatic interaction with the platform:
1. **Analytics API** - For sending events and querying analytics data
2. **Experiment API** - For managing feature flags and experiments
3. **Data API** - For data integration and management

### Documentation Structure
The documentation is organized into language-specific sections:
- **English (en)** - The primary documentation containing comprehensive product information
- **Japanese (jp)** - A localized version with translated content for Japanese-speaking users

The Japanese documentation maintains its own dedicated home page ("jp-home") while sharing the overall structure of the main documentation. It appears to use a translation workflow where content can be derived from original English pages.

### Content Components
The documentation includes several formatting components:
1. **Tabs Partial** - For organizing content into tabbed interfaces
2. **Collapse Partial** - For creating expandable/collapsible sections
3. **Admonition Partial** - For highlighting important information with styling options (Note, Warning, Info)

The documentation is managed through a content collection system, likely using a static site generator with content stored in Markdown format with YAML frontmatter for metadata.
