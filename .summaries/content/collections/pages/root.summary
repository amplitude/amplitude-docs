### Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into language-specific sections:
- **English (en)** - Primary documentation with comprehensive product information
- **Japanese (jp)** - Localized documentation for Japanese-speaking users

The Japanese documentation maintains its own dedicated home page ("jp-home") while sharing the overall structure of the main documentation. It uses the same content management system with translation workflows that reference original English content.

### Documentation Components
The documentation includes specialized components:
- **Tabs** for displaying code examples in different languages
- **Collapsible sections** for detailed information
- **Admonition blocks** (Note, Info, Warning, Example, Tip, Alpha, Beta, Deprecated)

The documentation system uses a blueprint-based content management approach with markdown files and YAML frontmatter. Each page has a unique ID in UUID format, and the system tracks content updates with user IDs and timestamps.
