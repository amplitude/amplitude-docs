# Amplitude Product Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and product intelligence platform designed to help businesses understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth. The platform provides tools for product analytics, data management, experimentation, and user session analysis.

## Core Products and Features

### Amplitude Analytics
The central product that enables teams to analyze user behavior, track events, and gain insights into how users interact with digital products. Analytics provides visualization tools, cohort analysis, and behavioral metrics to understand user journeys.

### Amplitude Data
A data management solution handling data integration, transformation, and governance. It allows teams to collect, process, and maintain high-quality data for analysis.

### Amplitude Experiment
A feature flagging and experimentation platform enabling teams to test hypotheses, run A/B tests, and implement feature flags to control feature rollouts.

### Amplitude Session Replay
A visual analytics tool that records and replays user sessions to provide context around quantitative data, helping teams understand exactly how users interact with their products.

## Product Relationships and Ecosystem

Amplitude's platform functions as an integrated ecosystem with a clear data flow:

1. **Data Collection Layer**: Events are collected through SDKs and APIs and fed into Amplitude Data
2. **Analysis Layer**: Amplitude Analytics processes this data to generate insights
3. **Action Layer**: Insights drive decisions in Amplitude Experiment for feature releases and tests
4. **Validation Layer**: Session Replay provides visual confirmation of user behavior

While designed to work together seamlessly, each product can also function independently based on customer needs.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Events**: User actions or system occurrences tracked in Amplitude
- **Event Properties**: Metadata associated with events providing context
- **User Properties**: Attributes associated with users that persist across sessions
- **Cohorts**: Groups of users who share common behaviors or attributes
- **Feature Flags**: Toggles that enable/disable features for specific users
- **Custom Formulas**: User-defined calculations for custom metrics

## Integration Methods

### Amplitude SDKs
Software development kits for various platforms to integrate tracking into applications. These handle event tracking, user identification, and data transmission.

### Amplitude APIs
Various APIs for programmatic interaction:
- Data ingestion APIs for sending events
- Export APIs for retrieving data
- Management APIs for configuring the platform
