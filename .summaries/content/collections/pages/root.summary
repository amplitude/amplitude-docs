# Amplitude Product Documentation

## Product Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics platform designed to help businesses understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth. The platform consists of four main products:

1. **Analytics** - Core solution for tracking and analyzing user behavior
2. **Data** - Integration and management capabilities for centralizing data
3. **Experiment** - A/B testing and feature experimentation solution
4. **Session Replay** - Visual recording and playback of user sessions

The platform provides various SDKs and APIs for implementation and integration with other systems, supporting developers and product teams with extensive documentation.

## Product Relationships and Features

### Core Products Ecosystem

- **Analytics**: The foundation of Amplitude, providing event tracking, user identification, and behavioral analysis capabilities.
- **Data**: Handles data integration, transformation, and warehouse connections to centralize organizational data.
- **Experiment**: Built on Analytics, enables teams to run A/B tests and feature experiments with statistical rigor.
- **Session Replay**: Complements Analytics by providing visual context to quantitative data through session recordings.

These products work together seamlessly but can also function independently based on specific needs.

### Implementation Methods

Amplitude offers multiple implementation options:

1. **SDKs**: Client and server-side libraries for various platforms
2. **APIs**: Programmatic access to Amplitude functionality
3. **Direct integrations**: Pre-built connections with other tools and platforms

## Documentation Structure and Internationalization

The documentation is organized into language-specific directories:

1. **English Documentation** (`/content/collections/pages/en`): Primary documentation covering all Amplitude products and features
2. **Japanese Documentation** (`/content/collections/pages/jp`): Translated subset of documentation for Japanese-speaking users

The documentation uses Markdown files with YAML front matter for metadata, including:
- Unique ID
- Blueprint designation
- Title information
- Publication status
- Update tracking
- Display configuration parameters

### Documentation Components

The documentation utilizes several UI components:

1. **Tabs Component**: Organizes code examples by programming language or platform
2. **Collapse Component**: Provides expandable sections for detailed information
3. **Admonition Types**:
   - Note, Info, Warning, Example, Tip
   - Alpha (early-access features)
   - Beta (pre-release features)
   - Deprecated (features being phased out)

## Integration Ecosystem

Amplitude integrates with various systems:

- **Data Warehouses**: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift
- **Customer Data Platforms**: For unified customer data
- **Marketing Tools**: Marketing automation platforms
- **Development Tools**: Development and deployment workflows

The Japanese documentation maintains the same content management structure as the main documentation, using the same blueprint system for page templates, while being managed through the same content management system.
