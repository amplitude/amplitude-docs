# Amplitude Product Documentation Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive analytics and data platform designed to help businesses understand user behavior, optimize experiences, and drive growth. The platform consists of four main products:

1. **Amplitude Analytics** - The flagship product for tracking and analyzing user behavior across digital products
2. **Amplitude Data** - Tools for data integration, management, and governance
3. **Amplitude Experiment** - A feature flagging and experimentation platform
4. **Amplitude Session Replay** - A visual tool for capturing and analyzing user sessions

The platform enables companies to track user interactions, analyze behavior patterns, create custom metrics, conduct experiments, and visualize user sessions to improve product experiences.

## Product Relationships and Features

Amplitude's ecosystem is designed for seamless integration between its components:

- **Analytics** serves as the core platform, collecting and processing event data
- **Data** provides the infrastructure for ingesting, processing, and managing this data
- **Experiment** leverages user data from Analytics to target and measure experiments
- **Session Replay** complements Analytics by providing visual context to quantitative data

Key features across the platform include:
- Event tracking for capturing user interactions
- User properties for segmentation and analysis
- Custom formulas for advanced metrics
- User identification methods
- Feature flags for controlled feature rollouts
- Experimentation capabilities

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event** - A discrete user action or occurrence tracked in Amplitude
- **User Property** - Attributes associated with a user that persist across sessions
- **Session** - A period of continuous user activity
- **Feature Flag** - A toggle that enables/disables features for specific users
- **Experiment** - A controlled test comparing different variations of a feature
- **Data Integration** - The process of connecting external data sources to Amplitude
- **Blueprint** - Templates used in the Statamic CMS for page structure
- **Origin Reference** - Metadata field tracking original content source for localization

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude provides a multilingual documentation ecosystem with:

1. A primary English documentation portal
2. Localized versions, including a Japanese documentation portal
3. A shared content management system (Statamic) that handles multilingual content

The documentation is structured to maintain consistency across languages while allowing for localized navigation and content. The system tracks relationships between original content and translations through origin reference IDs.

## Technical Implementation

### APIs and SDKs

Amplitude offers multiple integration points:

**APIs:**
- HTTP APIs - RESTful interfaces for programmatic access
- SDK APIs - Interfaces for client-side implementation
- SCIM APIs - Standards-based APIs for user management

**SDKs:**
- Mobile SDKs (iOS, Android)
- Web SDKs (JavaScript)
- Server-side SDKs
- Cross-platform SDKs

### Documentation Architecture

The documentation is implemented using Statamic CMS, with:
- Markdown files with YAML frontmatter for content
- References to Statamic-specific concepts like blueprints
- Unique ID generation for content items
- Version-controlled repository management
- Metadata tracking for content updates, authorship, and publication status

The documentation uses specialized components including tabs for code examples, collapsible sections, and admonitions (note, info, warning, example, tip, alpha, beta, and deprecated) to organize information effectively.
