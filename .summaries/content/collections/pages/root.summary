Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, manage data, run experiments, and monitor user sessions. The platform consists of four core products that work together to deliver end-to-end product intelligence capabilities.

## Core Product Suite

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational product for behavioral analytics, enabling organizations to track, measure, and analyze user interactions across digital properties. It provides insights into user journeys, conversion funnels, and product performance metrics.

**Amplitude Data** functions as the data management layer, handling data ingestion, transformation, and governance. It ensures data quality and provides mechanisms for data warehouse integration and analysis.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities, allowing teams to safely deploy features, run controlled experiments, and make data-driven product decisions.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and reconstructs user sessions, providing visual insights into user behavior and helping identify usability issues and optimization opportunities.

## Integration Architecture

The platform operates through a multi-layered integration approach combining SDKs and APIs. The SDK layer, exemplified by the Browser SDK 2 and session-replay-browser package, provides client-side instrumentation for web applications. These SDKs handle event tracking, user identification, and session capture with configurable parameters including:

- `flushIntervalMillis` and `flushQueueSize` for data transmission optimization
- `logLevel` configuration with options like `LogLevel.Debug`
- `serverZone` settings for EU/US data residency
- `transportProvider` options including `FetchTransport`
- `useBatch` API for efficient data delivery
- `instanceName` parameter for multi-instance deployments

The API layer provides programmatic access to platform functionality, enabling custom integrations, data exports, and administrative operations.

## Key Nomenclature and Concepts

The platform employs specific terminology around data collection and analysis:

- **Event Properties**: Attributes that describe specific user actions or system events
- **User Properties**: Characteristics and attributes associated with individual users
- **Feature Flags**: Configuration switches that control feature availability and behavior
- **Session Replay**: Visual recordings of user interactions within applications
- **Data Warehouse Analysis**: Integration capabilities for connecting external data storage systems

## Documentation Infrastructure

The documentation system utilizes a component-based architecture with reusable UI elements:

- **Partials System**: Modular content blocks for consistent documentation presentation
- **Tabs Partial**: Interactive tabbed interfaces for organizing related content
- **Collapse Partial**: Expandable sections for detailed information
- **Admonition Partial**: Highlighted blocks for important notes and warnings

The documentation supports multiple output formats including JSON and LLMs.txt for programmatic access and AI training purposes.

## Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude positions itself as a central hub in the modern data stack, integrating with data warehouses, customer data platforms, and business intelligence tools. The platform's data management capabilities enable bidirectional data flow, allowing organizations to enrich Amplitude data with external sources while also exporting insights to downstream systems.

The session replay functionality complements the analytics capabilities by providing qualitative context to quantitative metrics, enabling teams to understand not just what users do, but how they experience the product. The experimentation platform closes the loop by enabling teams to act on insights through controlled feature rollouts and testing.
