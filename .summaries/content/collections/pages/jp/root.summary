# Amplitude Japanese Documentation

## Product Overview
Amplitude is a product analytics platform that provides documentation in Japanese. The Japanese documentation section is a dedicated resource for Japanese-speaking users to understand and utilize Amplitude's analytics capabilities.

## Directory Structure and Relationships
The `/content/collections/pages/jp` directory contains Japanese language documentation files for Amplitude. Currently, the directory includes:

1. `jp-home.md` - The main landing page for Japanese documentation
2. `test.md` - A test page that is currently unpublished

The Japanese documentation appears to be a subset or translation of the main Amplitude documentation, organized in a separate directory to facilitate language-specific content management.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions
- **Blueprint: home** - Indicates that the file serves as a homepage template
- **Nav_title: japanese_content** - Navigation title used for the Japanese content section
- **hide_helpful** - A parameter set to true, likely disabling helpful feedback widgets on the Japanese pages
- **exclude_from_sitemap** - Parameter controlling whether the page appears in site navigation
- **origin** - References the original content ID that a translated page is based on

## Product Ecosystem Integration
The Japanese documentation is integrated into the broader Amplitude documentation ecosystem as follows:

1. It maintains the same content management structure as the main documentation
2. It uses the same blueprint system for page templates
3. It appears to be managed through the same content management system
4. The documentation likely covers the same product features and capabilities as the main documentation, but in Japanese

The presence of an `origin` field in the test document suggests that the Japanese content may be translations of existing English documentation, with references maintained to the source material.

## Technical Implementation
The documentation is implemented using Markdown files with YAML front matter for metadata. Each file includes:

- A unique ID
- Blueprint designation
- Title information
- Publication status
- Update tracking information
- Display configuration parameters

No specific API endpoints or command line invocations are mentioned in the provided files.
