## Amplitude Japanese Documentation Portal

This directory represents the Japanese localization component of Amplitude's documentation ecosystem. Amplitude is a digital analytics platform that helps organizations understand user behavior and optimize product experiences through comprehensive event tracking and analysis.

## Product Relationship and Structure

The Japanese documentation portal serves as a localized entry point for Japanese-speaking users accessing Amplitude's analytics platform documentation. The structure indicates a content management system approach where:

- **jp-home.md** functions as the primary landing page for Japanese documentation, serving as the navigation hub for Japanese users
- **test.md** represents development/staging content used for testing localization workflows before publication

The relationship between these components suggests a multi-stage content publication process where content can exist in draft states before being made available to end users.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Blueprint System**: The documentation uses a blueprint-based content architecture where `blueprint: home` defines the structural template and functionality for homepage content.

**Content Collections**: The `/collections/pages/jp/` path structure indicates a hierarchical content organization system where Japanese content is segregated by language code (`jp`) within the broader pages collection.

**Origin Tracking**: The `origin` field in content files establishes relationships between localized versions and source content, enabling content synchronization across different language variants.

**Publication States**: Content can exist in multiple states (`published: false`) allowing for content staging and review processes before public availability.

## Ecosystem Integration

Within Amplitude's broader product ecosystem, this Japanese documentation portal serves as a critical localization component that:

- Provides market-specific access to Amplitude's analytics platform documentation
- Supports Amplitude's global expansion strategy by offering native language support
- Integrates with the main documentation infrastructure while maintaining language-specific content paths
- Enables region-specific content customization while leveraging shared underlying documentation systems

The portal connects Japanese users to Amplitude's core analytics capabilities including event tracking, user segmentation, funnel analysis, and behavioral cohort studies, but presents this information in culturally and linguistically appropriate formats.

## Technical Implementation

The documentation system utilizes a content management approach with:

- **Unique Identifiers**: Each content piece uses UUID-based identification (`id: 9bf6d854-cbcc-4db3-a3f9-3f291b2f02e9`)
- **User Attribution**: Content changes are tracked via user IDs (`updated_by: 0c3a318b-936a-4cbd-8fdf-771a90c297f0`)
- **Timestamp Management**: Unix timestamp tracking for content updates (`updated_at: 1718402690`)
- **SEO Configuration**: Sitemap exclusion controls (`exclude_from_sitemap: false`)
- **UI Customization**: Interface element controls (`hide_helpful: true`)

This technical foundation supports scalable content localization while maintaining consistency with Amplitude's global documentation standards.
