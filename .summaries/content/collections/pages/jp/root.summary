# Amplitude Japanese Documentation Portal

## Product Overview

Amplitude's Japanese documentation portal is a localized version of Amplitude's product documentation designed specifically for Japanese-speaking users. The portal provides access to translated documentation for Amplitude's analytics and product intelligence platform, allowing Japanese users to understand and utilize Amplitude's features in their native language.

## Directory Structure and Relationship

The Japanese documentation portal consists of:

1. **Home Page (`jp-home.md`)**: The main entry point for Japanese users accessing Amplitude documentation
2. **Test Page (`test.md`)**: A placeholder page that appears to be unpublished and used for testing purposes

The directory structure follows Amplitude's content organization pattern, with localized content stored in a dedicated `/jp/` subdirectory within the main content collection. This separation allows for maintaining parallel content structures across different languages while keeping the same underlying architecture.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Blueprint**: References to "blueprint: home" in the metadata suggest the use of Statamic CMS templates/blueprints for page structure
- **Origin Reference**: The metadata field tracking the original content source, likely used for synchronization between language versions
- **Publication Status**: Boolean flag indicating whether content is publicly accessible
- **Updated By/At**: Tracking metadata for content management purposes

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Japanese documentation portal appears to be part of Amplitude's broader documentation ecosystem, which likely includes:

1. A primary English documentation portal
2. Multiple localized versions for different languages
3. A shared content management system (Statamic) that handles multilingual content

The documentation is structured to maintain consistency across languages while allowing for localized navigation and content. The system appears to track relationships between original content and translations through origin reference IDs.

## Technical Implementation

The documentation is implemented using Statamic CMS, as evidenced by:

- The use of Markdown files with YAML frontmatter for content
- References to Statamic-specific concepts like blueprints
- Unique ID generation for content items (e.g., "a7f9d0c4-f5e8-4b9a-9eb0-97a1e7f28b27")

Content appears to be managed through a version-controlled repository, with metadata tracking for content updates, authorship, and publication status.
