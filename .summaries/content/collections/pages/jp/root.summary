# Amplitude Japanese Documentation

## Overview
Amplitude is a product analytics platform with a dedicated Japanese documentation section. The Japanese documentation provides localized content for Japanese-speaking users to understand and utilize Amplitude's analytics capabilities.

## Product Structure
The Japanese documentation appears to be organized as a separate section within the broader Amplitude documentation ecosystem. It consists of:

- A dedicated home page for Japanese documentation
- Potentially translated versions of the main documentation content

## Key Nomenclature
- **jp-home**: The main landing page for Japanese documentation
- **japanese_content**: Navigation title for the Japanese documentation section
- **test**: A currently unpublished page that appears to be a translated version of content from another page (referenced by the origin ID)

## Integration with Product Ecosystem
The Japanese documentation is integrated into the main Amplitude documentation platform as follows:

1. It maintains its own dedicated home page while likely sharing the overall structure of the main documentation
2. It uses the same content management system as the main documentation
3. It appears to use a translation workflow where content can be derived from original English pages (as suggested by the "origin" field in the test page)

## Technical Details
- The documentation is managed through a content collection system, likely using a static site generator
- Content is stored in Markdown format with YAML frontmatter for metadata
- Content IDs are used to reference and relate pages (e.g., the origin ID in the test page)
- The documentation includes configuration options for:
  - Excluding pages from sitemaps
  - Hiding helpful widgets or components
  - Publishing/unpublishing content

The Japanese documentation section appears to be actively maintained, with recent updates to the home page (timestamp: 1718402690) and test page (timestamp: 1733261724).
