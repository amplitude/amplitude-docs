# Amplitude Japanese Documentation

## Overview
Amplitude is a product analytics platform that offers documentation in Japanese. The Japanese documentation section is a dedicated resource for Japanese-speaking users to understand and utilize Amplitude's features and capabilities.

## Product Structure
The Japanese documentation appears to be organized as a separate section within the broader Amplitude documentation ecosystem. It consists of:

- A dedicated home page for Japanese documentation
- Potentially translated versions of the main documentation content

## Key Nomenclature
- **jp-home**: The main landing page for Japanese documentation
- **japanese_content**: Navigation title for the Japanese documentation section
- **test**: A currently unpublished page that appears to be in development or testing

## Integration with Product Ecosystem
The Japanese documentation is integrated into the main Amplitude documentation platform, providing localized content for Japanese users. This suggests that Amplitude has a commitment to supporting international users with native language documentation.

## Technical Details
- The documentation is built using a blueprint-based content management system
- Content is managed through markdown files with YAML frontmatter
- Each page has unique identifiers (e.g., `9bf6d854-cbcc-4db3-a3f9-3f291b2f02e9`)
- Pages can be excluded from the sitemap if needed
- Content can be marked as published or unpublished
- The system supports content origin references, suggesting content may be translated or derived from other pages

The Japanese documentation section appears to be actively maintained, with recent updates to the home page (timestamp: 1718402690) and test page (timestamp: 1733261724).
