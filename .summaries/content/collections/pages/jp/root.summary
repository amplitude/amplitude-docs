## Amplitude Japanese Documentation Portal

This directory represents the Japanese localization component of Amplitude's documentation ecosystem. Amplitude is a digital analytics platform that helps organizations understand user behavior and optimize product experiences through comprehensive event tracking and analysis.

## Product Structure and Localization Framework

The directory follows a structured internationalization approach with dedicated Japanese content management:

- **Primary Landing Page**: `jp-home.md` serves as the main entry point for Japanese users, configured with the `home` blueprint template
- **Content Localization System**: Utilizes a content management system with unique identifiers and publishing workflows specifically designed for multilingual documentation
- **Navigation Integration**: Features dedicated Japanese navigation (`nav_title: japanese_content`) that integrates with the broader documentation site architecture

## Key Technical Components and Nomenclature

**Content Management Architecture**:
- **Blueprint System**: Template-based content structure using `blueprint: home` for consistent page layouts
- **UUID-based Identification**: Each document uses unique identifiers (e.g., `9bf6d854-cbcc-4db3-a3f9-3f291b2f02e9`) for content tracking and version management
- **Publishing Workflow**: Content states include draft and published modes with granular control over visibility
- **Sitemap Integration**: Configurable search engine optimization with `exclude_from_sitemap` controls

**Localization Features**:
- **Origin Tracking**: Content pieces maintain relationships to source documents through `origin` field references
- **User Attribution**: Comprehensive audit trail with `updated_by` and `updated_at` timestamps for content governance
- **Helpful Widget Control**: Customizable user experience elements (`hide_helpful: true`) for region-specific interface preferences

## Ecosystem Integration

The Japanese documentation portal integrates into Amplitude's broader product ecosystem as a localized access point for:

- **Analytics Platform Documentation**: Providing Japanese-language guidance for Amplitude's core analytics features including event tracking, user segmentation, and behavioral analysis
- **Developer Resources**: Localized technical documentation for SDK implementations, API integrations, and data management workflows
- **Global Documentation Network**: Part of a multi-regional documentation strategy that maintains content consistency while accommodating local language and cultural requirements

The content management system supports sophisticated publishing workflows with draft states, origin tracking for translation management, and integrated navigation systems that ensure Japanese users can access comprehensive product documentation in their preferred language while maintaining synchronization with the global product updates and feature releases.
