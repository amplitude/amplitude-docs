# Amplitude Japanese Documentation

## Overview
Amplitude is a product analytics platform with a dedicated Japanese documentation section. The Japanese documentation provides localized content for Japanese-speaking users to understand and utilize Amplitude's analytics capabilities.

## Product Structure
The Japanese documentation appears to be organized as a separate section within the broader Amplitude documentation ecosystem. It consists of:

- A dedicated home page for Japanese documentation
- Potentially translated versions of the main documentation content

## Key Nomenclature
- **jp-home**: The main landing page for Japanese documentation
- **japanese_content**: Navigation title for the Japanese documentation section
- **test**: A currently unpublished page that appears to be a translated version of content from another page (referenced by the origin ID)

## Integration with Product Ecosystem
The Japanese documentation is integrated into the main Amplitude documentation platform as follows:

1. It maintains its own dedicated home page while likely sharing the overall structure of the main documentation
2. It uses the same content management system as the main documentation
3. It appears to use a translation workflow where content can be derived from original English pages (as suggested by the "origin" field in the test page)

## Technical Details
- The documentation uses a blueprint-based content management system
- Content is managed through markdown files with YAML frontmatter
- Each page has a unique ID (UUID format)
- Pages can be excluded from the sitemap if needed
- Content appears to support translation workflows with origin references
- The system tracks content updates with user IDs and timestamps

The Japanese documentation section is designed to provide the same comprehensive product information as the main documentation but tailored specifically for Japanese-speaking users.
