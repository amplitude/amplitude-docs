## Amplitude Product Ecosystem

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and product intelligence platform consisting of four core products: Analytics, Data, Experiment, and Session Replay. The platform provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive data-driven decision making through event tracking, experimentation, and user session analysis.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem is built around a unified data foundation that connects four primary products:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the core analytics engine, providing behavioral analytics and user journey insights through event tracking and custom analysis capabilities.

**Amplitude Data** functions as the data integration layer, enabling connections with data warehouses and external systems to centralize product data across the organization.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers feature flag management and A/B testing capabilities, allowing teams to safely deploy and test new features with controlled user segments.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user session recordings, providing visual insights into user interactions and behavior patterns on web applications.

These products work together through shared user identification, event data, and analytics infrastructure, creating a cohesive product intelligence platform.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Event Properties vs User Properties**: The platform distinguishes between event-level attributes (event properties) that describe specific user actions and user-level attributes (user properties) that describe user characteristics and persist across sessions.

**User Tracking and Identification**: The system uses `user_id` and `device_id` parameters to track and identify users across sessions and devices, enabling cohort analysis and user journey mapping.

**Session Replay Components**: Browser-based components that capture user interactions, specifically the `@amplitude/session-replay-browser` package for web applications.

**SDK Initialization**: The platform uses boot methods like `amplitudeEngagement.boot()` with configuration objects such as `AmplitudeBootOptions` to initialize tracking across different platforms.

**Custom Formulas**: Advanced analytics capabilities that allow users to create custom calculations and metrics beyond standard event counting.

## Integration Points and Implementation

The platform provides multiple integration methods:

**Browser SDK 2**: The primary web SDK for client-side event tracking and session replay implementation, supporting both basic and advanced initialization patterns.

**Swift SDK**: Mobile SDK supporting iOS applications with similar initialization patterns using `AmplitudeBootOptions` for configuration.

**Data Warehouse Integration**: Direct connections to enterprise data warehouses for bi-directional data flow and advanced analytics.

The SDKs support flexible configuration through options objects that handle user properties mapping, device identification, and session management across different platforms and environments.

## Developer Resources

The platform maintains separate documentation sections for **Amplitude APIs** and **Amplitude SDKs**, indicating a clear separation between server-side API integrations and client-side SDK implementations. The documentation structure suggests comprehensive coverage of both programmatic access through APIs and embedded tracking through various platform-specific SDKs.
