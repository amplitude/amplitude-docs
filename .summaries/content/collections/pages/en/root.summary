# Amplitude Product Ecosystem Overview

Amplitude offers a comprehensive analytics and data platform designed to help businesses understand user behavior, optimize experiences, and drive growth. The platform consists of four main products that work together to provide a complete solution for product analytics, experimentation, and user experience optimization.

## Core Products

1. **Amplitude Analytics** - The flagship product for tracking and analyzing user behavior across digital products.
2. **Amplitude Data** - Tools for data integration, management, and governance.
3. **Amplitude Experiment** - A feature flagging and experimentation platform.
4. **Amplitude Session Replay** - A visual tool for capturing and analyzing user sessions.

## Key Features and Concepts

- **Event Tracking** - Core functionality for capturing user interactions and behaviors
- **User Properties** - Attributes associated with users for segmentation and analysis
- **Custom Formulas** - Advanced analytics capabilities for creating custom metrics
- **User Identification** - Methods for identifying and tracking unique users
- **SDK Implementation** - Tools for integrating Amplitude tracking into applications
- **Feature Flags** - Controlled rollout of features to specific user segments

## Product Relationships and Integration

Amplitude's ecosystem is designed for seamless integration between its components:

- **Analytics** serves as the core platform, collecting and processing event data
- **Data** provides the infrastructure for ingesting, processing, and managing this data
- **Experiment** leverages user data from Analytics to target and measure experiments
- **Session Replay** complements Analytics by providing visual context to quantitative data

## API and SDK Infrastructure

Amplitude provides multiple integration points for developers:

### APIs

1. **HTTP APIs** - RESTful interfaces for programmatic access to Amplitude data and functionality
2. **SDK APIs** - Interfaces for client-side implementation of Amplitude tracking
3. **SCIM APIs** - Standards-based APIs for user management and provisioning

### SDKs

Amplitude offers SDKs across multiple platforms:
- Mobile SDKs (iOS, Android)
- Web SDKs (JavaScript)
- Server-side SDKs
- Cross-platform SDKs

These SDKs enable event instrumentation, user tracking, and integration with the Amplitude platform.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event** - A discrete user action or occurrence tracked in Amplitude
- **User Property** - Attributes associated with a user that persist across sessions
- **Session** - A period of continuous user activity
- **Feature Flag** - A toggle that enables/disables features for specific users
- **Experiment** - A controlled test comparing different variations of a feature
- **Data Integration** - The process of connecting external data sources to Amplitude

## Documentation Components

The documentation uses several specialized components:
- **Tabs** - For displaying code examples in different languages
- **Collapsible Sections** - For organizing detailed information
- **Admonitions** - Highlighted boxes for important information, including:
  - Note
  - Info
  - Warning
  - Example
  - Tip
  - Alpha (early access features)
  - Beta (pre-release features)
  - Deprecated (features being phased out)

The documentation is structured to support both new users getting started with implementation and experienced users seeking advanced functionality across the Amplitude product suite.
