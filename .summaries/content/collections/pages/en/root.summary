Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and make data-driven decisions. The platform consists of four core products that work together to deliver end-to-end product intelligence capabilities.

## Core Product Suite

**Analytics** serves as the foundational product analytics engine, enabling teams to track, measure, and analyze user interactions across digital products. **Data** provides robust tech stack integration capabilities, allowing organizations to connect Amplitude with their existing data infrastructure and warehouse systems. **Experiment** delivers A/B testing and optimization functionality with advanced statistical methodologies, while **Session Replay** reconstructs complete digital user experiences for qualitative analysis and debugging.

## Technical Implementation Architecture

The platform operates through a multi-layered technical architecture consisting of SDKs, APIs, and web-based interfaces. **Amplitude SDKs** provide client-side integration capabilities across multiple platforms, including JavaScript Browser SDK 2 and Swift SDK implementations. The JavaScript SDK supports session replay functionality through the `@amplitude/session-replay-browser` package, with initialization methods like `amplitude.init()` that accept configuration options for `fetchRemoteConfig` and `autocapture` settings using `AMPLITUDE_API_KEY` authentication.

The Swift SDK utilizes `amplitudeEngagement.boot()` methods with `AmplitudeBootOptions` configuration objects that handle user identification through `user_id`, `device_id`, and `user_properties` parameters. **Amplitude APIs** complement the SDK layer by providing server-side integration capabilities for data ingestion, user management, and programmatic access to platform features.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

The platform employs specific terminology for data modeling and user tracking. **Event properties** capture contextual information about specific user actions, while **user properties** store persistent attributes associated with individual users. **User identification tracking** enables cross-session and cross-device user journey analysis. **Feature flags** provide dynamic configuration capabilities for controlled feature rollouts and experimentation.

**Custom formulas** allow advanced metric calculations beyond standard analytics functions. The experimentation framework distinguishes between **treatment vs control** comparisons within **randomized control trials**, supporting both **binary and continuous metrics** for conversion rate testing and other statistical analyses.

## Statistical and Mathematical Framework

Amplitude Experiment implements sophisticated statistical methodologies, particularly **sequential testing** using **mixture sequential probability ratio test (mSPRT)**. This approach provides advantages over traditional T-tests for A/B testing statistical inference by enabling continuous monitoring of experiment results without inflating Type I error rates.

The mathematical foundation centers on **hypothesis testing** with **null hypothesis H₀: δ = 0**, utilizing **likelihood ratios** and **mixing distributions** to determine statistical significance. The platform supports LaTeX mathematical notation for precise statistical communication and documentation.

## Data Integration and Warehouse Connectivity

The Data product facilitates **data warehouse analysis** by connecting Amplitude's behavioral analytics with existing organizational data infrastructure. This integration enables comprehensive analysis that combines product usage data with business metrics, customer data, and other enterprise information sources.

## Content Delivery and Documentation Architecture

The platform utilizes CDN distribution through `cdn.amplitude.com` for SDK delivery and static asset serving. The documentation system employs structured content management with blueprint templates, section linking, and configurable navigation options including `hide_toc` and `hide_side-nav` settings for customized user experiences.

The documentation architecture supports multiple output formats including JSON APIs and LLM-optimized text formats, enabling programmatic access to product information and AI-powered documentation interactions.
