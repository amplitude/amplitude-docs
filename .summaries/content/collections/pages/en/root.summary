# Amplitude Product Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and product intelligence platform that helps businesses understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth. The platform consists of four main products that work together to provide a complete solution for product analytics, data management, experimentation, and user session analysis.

## Key Products and Features

### 1. Amplitude Analytics
A core product that enables teams to analyze user behavior, track events, and gain insights into how users interact with digital products. Analytics provides visualization tools, cohort analysis, and behavioral metrics to understand user journeys.

### 2. Amplitude Data
A data management solution that handles data integration, transformation, and governance. It allows teams to collect, process, and maintain high-quality data for analysis.

### 3. Amplitude Experiment
A feature flagging and experimentation platform that enables teams to test hypotheses, run A/B tests, and implement feature flags to control feature rollouts.

### 4. Amplitude Session Replay
A visual analytics tool that records and replays user sessions to provide context around quantitative data, helping teams understand exactly how users interact with their products.

## Product Relationships and Ecosystem

The Amplitude platform is designed as an integrated ecosystem where data flows between products:

- **Data Collection**: Events are collected through SDKs and APIs and fed into the Amplitude Data platform
- **Analysis Layer**: Amplitude Analytics processes this data to generate insights
- **Action Layer**: Insights drive decisions in Amplitude Experiment for feature releases and tests
- **Validation Layer**: Session Replay provides visual confirmation of user behavior to validate findings

The products are designed to work together seamlessly but can also be used independently depending on customer needs.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Events**: User actions or system occurrences tracked in Amplitude
- **Event Properties**: Metadata associated with events that provide context
- **User Properties**: Attributes associated with users that persist across sessions
- **Cohorts**: Groups of users who share common behaviors or attributes
- **Feature Flags**: Toggles that enable/disable features for specific users
- **Custom Formulas**: User-defined calculations for custom metrics

## Integration Methods

### Amplitude SDKs
Amplitude provides software development kits for various platforms to integrate tracking into applications. These SDKs handle event tracking, user identification, and data transmission to Amplitude servers.

### Amplitude APIs
The platform offers various APIs for programmatic interaction with Amplitude services, including:
- Data ingestion APIs for sending events
- Export APIs for retrieving data
- Management APIs for configuring the platform
