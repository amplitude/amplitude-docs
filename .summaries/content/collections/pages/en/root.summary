## Amplitude Product Ecosystem

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform consisting of four core products: **Analytics**, **Data**, **Experiment**, and **Session Replay**. The platform provides organizations with end-to-end capabilities for understanding user behavior, managing data pipelines, conducting experiments, and analyzing user interactions through session recordings.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem is built around a unified data foundation that connects four specialized products:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the core behavioral analytics engine, enabling organizations to track, measure, and analyze user interactions across digital properties. This product forms the foundation for data-driven decision making and user behavior insights.

**Amplitude Data** functions as the data management and pipeline orchestration layer, handling data ingestion, transformation, and routing to various destinations including data warehouses. This product ensures data quality and accessibility across the organization.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities, allowing teams to safely deploy features and measure their impact. This product integrates closely with Analytics to provide comprehensive experiment analysis.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user session recordings, providing qualitative insights to complement the quantitative data from Analytics. This product helps teams understand the "why" behind user behaviors identified in analytics data.

## Technical Implementation Framework

The platform is accessible through multiple technical interfaces:

**SDKs (Software Development Kits)** provide client-side integration capabilities, with the Browser SDK 2 being prominently featured for web applications. The SDK architecture supports extensive configuration options including:
- `instanceName` parameter for multi-instance deployments
- `flushIntervalMillis`, `flushQueueSize`, and `flushMaxRetries` for data transmission optimization
- `logLevel` and `loggerProvider` for debugging and monitoring
- `serverUrl` and `serverZone` (EU/US) for data residency compliance
- `transportProvider` with `FetchTransport` and `useBatch` parameter for network optimization
- Privacy controls through `optOut` boolean and `minIdLength` settings

**APIs** provide server-side integration and programmatic access to platform functionality, enabling custom integrations and automated workflows.

## Key Nomenclature and Concepts

**Event Properties** and **User Properties** form the core data model, capturing what users do (events) and who they are (user attributes). This distinction is fundamental to how Amplitude organizes and analyzes behavioral data.

**Feature Flags** enable controlled feature rollouts and experimentation, allowing teams to decouple deployment from release and conduct sophisticated A/B tests.

**Session Replay Browser** refers to the client-side component that captures user interactions for later analysis, with specific configuration parameters for the `amplitude-session-replay-browser` package.

**Data Warehouse Analysis** represents the integration capabilities that allow Amplitude to work with existing data infrastructure, supporting modern data stack architectures.

## Documentation Architecture

The documentation system utilizes a component-based architecture with reusable elements:
- **Tabs partial** for organizing content by programming language (js/ts)
- **Collapse partial** for managing detailed configuration tables
- **Admonition blocks** with semantic types (note, info, warning, example, tip, alpha, beta, deprecated) for highlighting important information

The documentation follows a blueprint-based content management system with structured metadata, author tracking, and publication status controls. The homepage serves as a product showcase with curated popular content, while maintaining clean navigation through `hide_toc` and `hide_side-nav` configurations.

This technical documentation framework supports both developer-focused implementation guides and business-oriented product explanations, reflecting Amplitude's position as a platform that serves both technical implementers and business stakeholders in the analytics and experimentation workflow.
