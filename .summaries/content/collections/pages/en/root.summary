## Amplitude Product Ecosystem

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and product intelligence platform consisting of four core products: Analytics, Data, Experiment, and Session Replay. The platform provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, manage data pipelines, conduct feature experimentation, and analyze user interactions through session recordings.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem is built around a unified data foundation that connects four specialized products:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the core behavioral analytics engine, enabling teams to track user interactions, analyze conversion funnels, and understand product usage patterns through event-based data collection.

**Amplitude Data** functions as the data management layer, providing capabilities for data warehouse integration, event property management, and user property tracking to ensure consistent data governance across the platform.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers feature flag management and A/B testing capabilities, allowing teams to safely deploy features and measure their impact on user behavior and business metrics.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user session recordings, providing visual insights into user interactions and helping identify usability issues and optimization opportunities.

## Technical Implementation Framework

The platform operates through two primary technical interfaces:

**Amplitude SDKs** provide client-side integration capabilities, with the Browser SDK 2 being a prominent implementation for web applications. The SDKs handle event tracking, user identification, and data transmission to Amplitude's servers.

**Amplitude APIs** enable server-side integrations and programmatic access to platform functionality, supporting data ingestion, user management, and analytics queries.

## Key Technical Nomenclature

**Event Properties**: Attributes that describe specific user actions or behaviors, providing contextual information about what users do within applications.

**User Properties**: Persistent attributes associated with individual users, enabling segmentation and personalization based on user characteristics.

**Instance Configuration**: SDK setup parameters including:
- `instanceName`: Identifier for specific SDK instances
- `flushIntervalMillis`: Timing configuration for data transmission
- `flushQueueSize`: Batch size settings for event processing
- `serverZone`: Geographic routing (EU/US) for data residency compliance
- `transportProvider`: Network layer configuration for data transmission
- `logLevel`: Debugging and monitoring verbosity settings
- `serverUrl`: Custom endpoint configuration
- `useBatch`: API optimization setting for bulk data operations

## Documentation Architecture

The documentation system utilizes a component-based architecture with reusable UI elements including tabs, collapse sections, and admonition blocks. The platform supports multiple content blueprints (page, home) with configurable navigation options (`hide_toc`, `hide_side-nav`) and structured content organization through collections and templates.

The documentation includes practical implementation examples, particularly for the session-replay-browser package, demonstrating real-world configuration scenarios and integration patterns for developers implementing Amplitude across web applications.
