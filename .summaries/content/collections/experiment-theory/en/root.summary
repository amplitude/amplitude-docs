## Amplitude Experiment Statistical Analysis Framework

Amplitude Experiment provides a comprehensive statistical analysis platform for A/B testing and Multi-Armed Bandit experiments, built around rigorous statistical methodologies and configurable testing parameters. The platform enables data-driven experimentation through sophisticated statistical tools while maintaining accessibility for practitioners across different technical backgrounds.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

The statistical analysis framework operates through two primary experimental methodologies that share common configuration interfaces but serve different use cases:

**A/B Testing Infrastructure** utilizes Welch's T-test as the core statistical engine, providing both two-sided and one-sided testing capabilities. This connects directly to the **Multi-Armed Bandit system**, which offers an alternative approach for scenarios requiring dynamic traffic allocation based on performance signals.

The **Goals panel** and **Analysis Settings** form the central configuration hub, where users define statistical preferences that cascade across all experimental components. The **MDE (Minimum Detectable Effect) configuration** integrates with the **T-test duration estimator** to provide real-time sample size calculations and experiment planning capabilities.

**Metric classification** operates through two distinct categories: **recommendation metrics** (primary success measures) and **guardrail metrics** (protective measures against negative impacts), each requiring different MDE considerations and statistical treatment.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE)**: The smallest meaningful change in a metric that an experiment should be able to detect, serving as the foundation for sample size calculations and experiment duration planning.

**Welch's T-test**: The primary statistical method for analyzing experimental results, designed to handle unequal variances between experimental groups while maintaining statistical rigor.

**Sample Size Target/Samples Per Variant Needed**: Calculated thresholds determining the minimum number of users required in each experimental variant to achieve statistical significance for the specified MDE.

**Two-sided vs One-sided Testing**: Statistical approaches where two-sided tests detect changes in either direction (increase or decrease), while one-sided tests focus on detecting changes in a specific direction only.

**Sequential Testing**: An alternative statistical methodology mentioned as an option to traditional fixed-sample T-testing, allowing for continuous monitoring and early stopping decisions.

**Central Limit Theorem Assumptions**: The statistical foundation underlying T-test validity, requiring sufficient sample sizes for proper distribution assumptions.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The statistical analysis framework serves as the analytical backbone for Amplitude's broader experimentation platform, connecting experiment design, execution, and analysis phases through integrated workflows. The **duration estimator** and **Cumulative Exposure graph** provide real-time experiment monitoring capabilities that feed into broader product analytics and decision-making systems.

The platform supports both **binary metrics** (conversion-based) and **continuous metrics** (value-based), enabling comprehensive analysis across different business objectives and KPI types. This flexibility allows integration with various product areas, from user acquisition and retention to revenue optimization and feature adoption.

**Business risk assessment** capabilities integrate MDE configuration with organizational decision-making processes, ensuring statistical rigor aligns with business impact thresholds and resource allocation decisions.

## Technical Implementation Details

The system operates through the **Settings tab** interface, where users access the **Goals panel** for metric configuration and **Analysis Settings Stats Preferences** for statistical parameter definition. The **T-test duration estimator** provides algorithmic sample size calculations based on MDE specifications, current traffic patterns, and desired statistical power.

The platform automatically handles **false positive/negative rate** calculations and provides guidance on **sample size threshold** requirements, ensuring experiments maintain statistical validity while optimizing for practical business constraints and timeline requirements.
