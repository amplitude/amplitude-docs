# Amplitude Experiment: Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude Experiment is a statistical experimentation platform that enables users to design, run, and analyze experiments (A/B tests and Multi-Armed Bandits) to measure the impact of product changes. The platform provides robust statistical analysis tools to help users make data-driven decisions based on experiment results.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Experiment Types
- **A/B Testing**: Traditional hypothesis testing comparing a control group against one or more variants
- **Multi-Armed Bandit**: Adaptive experimentation that optimizes for performance during the experiment

### Statistical Analysis Tools
- **Welch's T-test**: Statistical method for comparing means between two populations
- **Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE)**: The smallest effect size that an experiment can reliably detect
- **Cumulative Exposure Graph**: Visual tool for monitoring experiment progress and results over time

### Experiment Configuration
- **One-sided vs. Two-sided Tests**: Options for directional or non-directional hypothesis testing
- **Sample Size Requirements**: Guidelines for ensuring statistical validity
- **Duration Estimator**: Tool to predict required experiment duration based on metrics and MDE

### Metrics Framework
- **Success Metrics**: Primary metrics used to determine experiment success
- **Guardrail Metrics**: Secondary metrics monitored to ensure no negative side effects
- **Binary Metrics**: Yes/no outcomes (e.g., conversion rates)
- **Continuous Metrics**: Numerical values with ranges (e.g., revenue, session duration)

## Relationships Between Features

The Amplitude Experiment platform integrates experiment design, execution, and analysis into a cohesive workflow:

1. **Experiment Design Phase**:
   - Users set the Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE) based on business goals
   - MDE directly influences sample size requirements and experiment duration
   - Users select appropriate metrics (success and guardrail)

2. **Experiment Execution Phase**:
   - Platform allocates users to control and variant groups
   - For Multi-Armed Bandit experiments, allocation may adjust dynamically

3. **Analysis Phase**:
   - Welch's T-test analyzes results for statistical significance
   - Cumulative Exposure graph visualizes experiment progress over time
   - Confidence interval bounds help interpret the reliability of results

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE)**: The smallest change in a metric that an experiment can reliably detect with statistical significance. Inversely related to sample size requirements.

- **Welch's T-test**: A statistical test that compares the means of two populations without assuming equal variances, used to determine if differences between control and variant are statistically significant.

- **Statistical Significance**: The likelihood that an observed effect is not due to random chance. Typically set at 95% confidence level (p < 0.05).

- **One-sided Test**: Tests for effects in only one direction (increase or decrease), providing more statistical power but only detecting changes in the specified direction.

- **Two-sided Test**: Tests for effects in either direction, requiring more data but detecting both positive and negative changes.

- **Central Limit Theorem**: Statistical principle that allows for normal distribution assumptions when sample sizes are sufficiently large.

- **Peeking**: The practice of checking experiment results before reaching the predetermined sample size, which can increase false positive rates.

- **False Positive/Negative Rates**: The probability of incorrectly concluding an effect exists (false positive) or missing a real effect (false negative).

- **Confidence Interval Bounds**: Range of values that likely contains the true effect size, indicating the precision of the estimate.

- **Cumulative Exposure Graph**: Visualization showing how experiment metrics evolve over time as more users are exposed to the experiment.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Experiment appears to be part of the broader Amplitude analytics ecosystem, with integration points that allow:

1. Using user behavior data from Amplitude Analytics to inform experiment design
2. Feeding experiment results back into the analytics platform for deeper analysis
3. Leveraging existing user segments and cohorts for targeted experimentation

The platform emphasizes a data-driven approach to product development, where experiments are designed with clear hypotheses, appropriate statistical rigor, and business-relevant metrics.

## API and Technical Implementation

While specific API endpoints aren't detailed in the provided documentation, the platform likely includes:

- APIs for creating and configuring experiments
- Methods for setting MDE and other statistical parameters
- Endpoints for retrieving experiment results and statistical analyses
- Integration points with other Amplitude products and potentially third-party tools

The documentation suggests a user-friendly interface for configuring statistical tests and interpreting results, with underlying statistical rigor to ensure valid conclusions.
