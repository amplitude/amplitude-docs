## Amplitude Experiment Statistical Analysis Framework

Amplitude Experiment provides a comprehensive statistical analysis platform for A/B testing and Multi-Armed Bandit experiments, built around rigorous statistical methodologies to ensure reliable experiment results. The platform emphasizes proper experimental design, statistical significance testing, and risk assessment to help teams make data-driven decisions.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

The statistical analysis capabilities in Amplitude Experiment are tightly integrated across the experiment lifecycle:

**Experiment Design Phase**: Users configure experiments through the Settings tab, where they define statistical parameters including MDE (Minimum Detectable Effect), sample size requirements, and metric types. The Goals panel serves as the primary configuration interface for setting up both recommendation metrics (primary success indicators) and guardrail metrics (safety measures).

**Statistical Testing Engine**: The platform employs Welch's T-test as its core statistical method, supporting both binary and continuous metrics. Users can configure two-sided testing (detecting changes in either direction) or one-sided testing (detecting changes in a specific direction) based on their experimental hypotheses.

**Analysis and Monitoring**: Real-time experiment monitoring is provided through the Cumulative Exposure graph and duration estimator, which track progress toward statistical significance. The Analysis Settings Stats Preferences allow teams to customize their statistical approach based on organizational requirements.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**MDE (Minimum Detectable Effect)**: The smallest meaningful change in a metric that an experiment should be able to detect with statistical confidence. This directly influences required sample sizes and experiment duration.

**Welch's T-test**: The statistical method used for hypothesis testing, which doesn't assume equal variances between groups and is suitable for both binary conversion metrics and continuous value metrics.

**Sample Size Threshold**: The minimum number of users per variant required to achieve statistical significance, calculated based on the MDE, baseline conversion rates, and desired confidence levels.

**Two-sided vs One-sided Testing**: Two-sided tests detect changes in either direction (increases or decreases), while one-sided tests focus on detecting changes in a specific direction, requiring smaller sample sizes but with directional assumptions.

**Control Mean**: The baseline performance metric from the control group, used as the reference point for calculating relative improvements and statistical significance.

**False Positive/Negative Rates**: Statistical risks where false positives represent incorrectly detecting an effect that doesn't exist, while false negatives represent missing a real effect.

## Ecosystem Integration and Methodology

Amplitude Experiment's statistical framework integrates with broader experimentation best practices through several key components:

**Central Limit Theorem Application**: The platform leverages statistical theory to ensure reliable results across different metric types and sample sizes, with built-in safeguards for minimum sample requirements.

**Sequential Testing Alternative**: While Welch's T-test is the primary method, the platform acknowledges alternative approaches for teams requiring different statistical methodologies.

**Risk Assessment Framework**: The system helps teams balance business risk against statistical rigor by allowing customization of significance thresholds and effect size requirements based on the potential impact of experimental changes.

**Duration and Resource Planning**: Integrated tools like the T-test duration estimator and Samples Per Variant Needed calculations help teams plan experiment timelines and resource allocation before launching tests.

## Configuration and Implementation

**Primary Configuration Path**: Settings tab → Goals panel → Analysis Settings Stats Preferences

**Key Configuration Parameters**:
- Statistical test type (two-sided/one-sided)
- Sample size thresholds per variant
- MDE values for different metric types
