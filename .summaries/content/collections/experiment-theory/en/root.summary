# Amplitude Experiment: Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude Experiment is a platform for designing, running, and analyzing controlled experiments (A/B tests and Multi-Armed Bandits) to make data-driven product decisions. The platform enables teams to test hypotheses about product changes by comparing metrics between different user groups and determining statistical significance of observed differences.

### Key Features
- Statistical analysis tools including Welch's T-test
- Experiment design capabilities with configurable parameters
- Sample size and duration estimation
- Real-time monitoring with Cumulative Exposure graphs
- Support for both A/B testing and Multi-Armed Bandit experiments
- Configurable Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE) settings

### Primary Use Cases
- Testing product changes before full deployment
- Measuring the impact of feature modifications on user behavior
- Optimizing conversion rates and other key metrics
- Making data-driven product decisions

## Product Relationships and Features

Amplitude Experiment appears to be part of a broader Amplitude analytics ecosystem, focusing specifically on experimentation capabilities. The platform consists of:

1. **Experiment Design Tools**: Features for setting up experiments with proper controls, variants, and parameters
2. **Statistical Analysis Engine**: Implements Welch's T-test and potentially other statistical methods
3. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Includes Cumulative Exposure graphs and real-time analysis
4. **Duration Estimator**: Calculates required sample sizes and experiment timeframes

The documentation suggests integration with other Amplitude products for comprehensive analytics, though specific integration points aren't detailed in the provided files.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Welch's T-test**: A statistical method used to compare means between two populations that doesn't assume equal variances
- **Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE)**: The smallest meaningful change in a metric that an experiment aims to detect
- **One-sided vs. Two-sided Tests**: Configuration options for T-tests where one-sided tests look for changes in a specific direction, while two-sided tests look for any change
- **Central Limit Theorem**: Statistical principle that allows for normal distribution assumptions when sample sizes are large enough
- **Confidence Interval**: Range of values that likely contains the true population parameter
- **Peeking**: The practice of checking experiment results before reaching adequate sample size, which can lead to false conclusions
- **Samples Per Variant Needed**: The required number of users in each experiment group to achieve statistical validity
- **Cumulative Exposure Graph**: Visualization showing the accumulation of users exposed to an experiment over time
- **Success Metrics**: Primary metrics an experiment aims to improve
- **Guardrail Metrics**: Secondary metrics monitored to ensure no negative side effects
- **Control Mean**: The baseline metric value in the control group

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Experiment appears to be part of a larger Amplitude analytics and product optimization suite. While specific integration details aren't fully described in the provided documentation, the platform likely:

1. Receives user behavior data from Amplitude Analytics
2. Integrates with feature flag systems for experiment deployment
3. Feeds results back into broader product analytics dashboards
4. Supports decision-making processes for product teams

The documentation suggests that experiment results can be analyzed within the Amplitude platform, indicating tight integration with other Amplitude tools.

## Technical Implementation Details

The documentation doesn't provide specific API endpoints or command line invocations, but does reference configuration options within the platform:

- Setting MDE values during experiment setup
- Configuring one-sided or two-sided T-tests
- Accessing Cumulative Exposure graphs for monitoring
- Using the duration estimator to calculate required sample sizes

The platform appears to have a web-based interface where these configurations and analyses are performed, though API access may be available for programmatic interaction.
