# Amplitude Experiment: Statistical Analysis and Experiment Design

## Product Overview

Amplitude Experiment is a platform for designing, running, and analyzing experiments to make data-driven product decisions. The product enables users to conduct statistical tests like A/B testing and Multi-Armed Bandit experiments to validate hypotheses about product changes. Key features include statistical analysis tools, experiment design capabilities, and duration estimation to ensure experiments are properly powered to detect meaningful effects.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Experiment Analysis
- **Welch's T-test**: A statistical method used to compare means between two populations (variants) in an experiment
- **Statistical Significance**: Determines whether observed differences between variants are likely due to chance or represent real effects
- **Confidence Intervals**: Ranges that estimate the true value of a metric with a specified level of confidence
- **Peeking**: The practice of checking experiment results before completion, which can lead to statistical errors if not accounted for
- **Duration Estimator**: Tool that calculates how long an experiment needs to run to achieve statistical validity

### Experiment Design
- **Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE)**: The smallest meaningful change in a metric that an experiment aims to detect
- **Sample Size Requirements**: The number of users needed per variant to achieve statistical power
- **A/B Testing**: Traditional hypothesis testing comparing a control group against one or more treatment groups
- **Multi-Armed Bandit**: An adaptive experiment approach that automatically allocates more traffic to better-performing variants
- **Success Metrics**: Primary metrics that an experiment aims to improve
- **Guardrail Metrics**: Secondary metrics monitored to ensure changes don't negatively impact other important aspects

## Relationships Between Features

The platform integrates experiment design and analysis in a cohesive workflow:

1. **Experiment Design Phase**:
   - Users set the Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE) based on business goals
   - The platform calculates required sample sizes and estimated experiment duration
   - Users configure test parameters (one-sided vs. two-sided tests)

2. **Experiment Running Phase**:
   - The platform collects data as users interact with different variants
   - "Cumulative Exposure" graphs track progress toward required sample sizes

3. **Analysis Phase**:
   - Welch's T-test analyzes the statistical significance of observed differences
   - Results include confidence intervals and p-values
   - The platform provides visualizations to interpret results

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Welch's T-test**: A statistical test that compares the means of two populations without assuming equal variances
- **Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE)**: The smallest change in a metric that an experiment is designed to detect with statistical significance
- **One-sided vs. Two-sided Tests**: 
  - One-sided: Tests if a variant is specifically better or worse than control
  - Two-sided: Tests if a variant is different from control in either direction
- **Central Limit Theorem**: Statistical principle that allows normal distribution assumptions for sample means, even when individual data points aren't normally distributed
- **Samples Per Variant Needed**: The number of users required in each experiment group to achieve statistical validity
- **Control Mean**: The baseline metric value in the control group against which variants are compared
- **Conversion Rate**: The percentage of users who complete a desired action

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Experiment appears to be part of the broader Amplitude analytics ecosystem, with:

- Integration with Amplitude's analytics capabilities for metric definition and measurement
- Ability to track and analyze user behavior across experiment variants
- Tools for both technical and non-technical users to design and interpret experiments

## Technical Implementation

The documentation suggests that Amplitude Experiment provides:

- A user interface for configuring experiment parameters (MDE, test type, etc.)
- Statistical analysis tools that automatically apply appropriate tests
- Visualization tools including "Cumulative Exposure" graphs to track experiment progress
- Duration estimation capabilities to help plan experiment timelines

The platform balances statistical rigor with practical business considerations, helping users design experiments that can detect meaningful changes while managing resources efficiently.
