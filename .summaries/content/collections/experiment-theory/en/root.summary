# Amplitude Experiment: Product Overview and Technical Documentation

## Product Overview

Amplitude Experiment is a statistical experimentation platform that enables users to design, run, and analyze experiments (A/B tests and Multi-Armed Bandits) to measure the impact of product changes. The platform provides robust statistical tools for determining experiment parameters, analyzing results, and making data-driven decisions.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Experiment Types
- **A/B Testing**: Traditional hypothesis testing comparing a control group against one or more variants
- **Multi-Armed Bandit**: Adaptive experimentation that automatically allocates more traffic to better-performing variants

### Statistical Analysis Tools
- **Welch's T-test**: Statistical method for comparing means between two populations
- **Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE)**: The smallest effect size that an experiment is designed to detect

### Experiment Design Components
- **Sample Size Requirements**: Calculations to determine how many users are needed per variant
- **Duration Estimator**: Tool to predict how long an experiment needs to run
- **Exposure Tracking**: Monitoring of cumulative exposure throughout the experiment

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Statistical Terms
- **Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE)**: The smallest meaningful change in a metric that an experiment should be able to detect. Expressed as a percentage change from the control mean.
- **Statistical Significance**: The likelihood that an observed effect is not due to random chance.
- **Two-sided Test**: Tests whether there is a difference between variants in either direction (increase or decrease).
- **One-sided Test**: Tests whether there is a difference in only one direction (either increase or decrease).
- **Central Limit Theorem**: Statistical principle that allows for normal distribution assumptions when sample sizes are large enough.

### Experiment Metrics
- **Success Metrics**: Primary metrics that determine if an experiment is successful.
- **Guardrail Metrics**: Secondary metrics monitored to ensure changes don't negatively impact important aspects of the product.
- **Control Mean**: The baseline metric value observed in the control group.
- **Conversion Rate**: The percentage of users who complete a desired action.

### Experiment Monitoring
- **Samples Per Variant Needed**: The required number of users in each variant to achieve statistical validity.
- **Cumulative Exposure Graph**: Visual representation of user exposure over time.
- **Sample Size Target**: The total number of users required across all variants.
- **Exposure Remaining**: The additional user exposure needed to reach statistical validity.

## Relationships Between Features

The Amplitude Experiment platform integrates several components that work together to support the experimentation process:

1. **Experiment Design**:
   - Setting the MDE directly impacts the required sample size (smaller MDE requires larger sample size)
   - The type of experiment (A/B test vs Multi-Armed Bandit) affects how the MDE is applied

2. **Experiment Monitoring**:
   - The duration estimator uses the MDE and current traffic to predict experiment completion
   - Cumulative Exposure graphs track progress toward the required sample size

3. **Analysis**:
   - Welch's T-test is used to analyze results once sample size requirements are met
   - Statistical significance is determined based on the pre-defined MDE and test parameters

## Best Practices and Warnings

1. **Avoid Peeking**: The documentation explicitly warns against analyzing results before reaching the required sample size, as this increases the risk of false positives.

2. **Sample Size Requirements**: The platform emphasizes the importance of reaching adequate sample sizes (typically 355+ samples per variant) to ensure the Central Limit Theorem applies.

3. **Risk Assessment**: When setting MDE, users should consider the tradeoff between experiment duration and sensitivity - smaller MDEs can detect subtler changes but require longer experiments.

## Integration in Product Ecosystem

Amplitude Experiment appears to be part of a broader Amplitude analytics ecosystem, with the experimentation platform leveraging user data and metrics from the core analytics product. The documentation suggests that experiment results can be analyzed within the context of other Amplitude features, though specific integration points aren't explicitly detailed in the provided files.

The platform seems designed to support product teams in making data-driven decisions through controlled experiments, with a focus on statistical rigor and proper experimental design.
