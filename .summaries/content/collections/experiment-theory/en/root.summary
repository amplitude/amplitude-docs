# Amplitude Experiment: Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude Experiment is a statistical experimentation platform that enables users to design, run, and analyze experiments (such as A/B tests and Multi-Armed Bandits) to measure the impact of product changes. The platform provides robust statistical tools for determining experiment parameters, analyzing results, and making data-driven decisions.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Experiment Analysis Tools
- **Welch's T-test**: A statistical method used to compare means between two populations (typically control and variant groups)
- **Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE)**: The smallest effect size that an experiment is designed to reliably detect
- **Duration Estimator**: Tool to calculate how long an experiment needs to run based on parameters like MDE and sample size

### Experiment Types
- **A/B Testing**: Traditional hypothesis testing comparing a control group against one or more variants
- **Multi-Armed Bandit**: Adaptive experimentation approach that optimizes for outcomes during the experiment

### Metrics Framework
- **Success Metrics**: Primary metrics that an experiment aims to improve
- **Guardrail Metrics**: Secondary metrics monitored to ensure changes don't negatively impact other important aspects
- **Recommendation Metrics**: Metrics used to guide experiment decisions

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE)**: The smallest meaningful change in a metric that an experiment should be able to detect. MDE is inversely related to sample size requirements - smaller MDEs require larger sample sizes.
- **Statistical Significance**: The likelihood that an observed effect is not due to random chance, typically expressed as a p-value.
- **Confidence Interval**: A range of values that likely contains the true effect size, with a specified probability (typically 95%).
- **One-sided vs. Two-sided Tests**: Configuration options for T-tests that determine whether the analysis looks for effects in one direction only or in either direction.
- **Central Limit Theorem**: Statistical principle that allows the T-test to work with non-normal distributions when sample sizes are sufficiently large.
- **Peeking Problem**: Statistical issue that arises when repeatedly checking experiment results before reaching the predetermined sample size.
- **Cumulative Exposure Graph**: Visualization tool showing the accumulation of users exposed to an experiment over time.

## Analysis Configuration Options

### T-Test Configuration
- **One-sided Test**: Used when only interested in detecting effects in a specific direction (increase or decrease)
- **Two-sided Test**: Used when interested in detecting effects in either direction
- **Sample Size Requirements**: The T-test requires sufficient sample sizes (typically 100+ users per variant) for statistical validity

### MDE Configuration
- **Setting MDE by Experiment Type**: Different approaches for A/B tests versus Multi-Armed Bandits
- **MDE for Different Metrics**: Ability to set different MDEs for success metrics versus guardrail metrics
- **Risk Assessment**: Balancing the risks of false positives and false negatives when setting MDE

## Integration with Amplitude Ecosystem

The documentation suggests that Amplitude Experiment is part of a broader Amplitude analytics ecosystem, with experiment analysis likely integrated with other Amplitude products for comprehensive product analytics. The platform appears to provide end-to-end experimentation capabilities from design through analysis.

## Technical Implementation

While specific API endpoints or command line invocations aren't explicitly mentioned in the provided documentation, the platform clearly offers configuration options for statistical tests and experiment parameters through a user interface that allows for customization of experiment analysis settings.
