## Summary
This documentation explains how to set the Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE) for experiments in Amplitude, detailing how MDE represents the minimum change expected from an experiment, with considerations for experiment type (A/B test or Multi-Armed Bandit), recommendation metrics, and associated risks, including the inverse relationship between MDE and required sample size.
