Amplitude Experiment is a comprehensive statistical analysis platform designed for A/B testing and Multi-Armed Bandit experiments, providing data-driven experimentation capabilities through sophisticated statistical methodologies while maintaining accessibility across different technical skill levels.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The platform operates through two interconnected experimental methodologies sharing common configuration interfaces. The **A/B Testing Infrastructure** employs Welch's T-test as its statistical engine, supporting both two-sided and one-sided testing approaches. This integrates seamlessly with the **Multi-Armed Bandit system**, which provides dynamic traffic allocation based on real-time performance signals for scenarios requiring adaptive optimization.

The **Goals panel** and **Analysis Settings** serve as the central configuration hub, where statistical preferences cascade across all experimental components. The **MDE (Minimum Detectable Effect) configuration** directly integrates with the **T-test duration estimator**, delivering real-time sample size calculations and comprehensive experiment planning capabilities.

Metric architecture operates through two distinct classification systems: **recommendation metrics** function as primary success measures, while **guardrail metrics** serve as protective measures against negative impacts. Each category requires different MDE considerations and specialized statistical treatment protocols.

## Core Nomenclature and Statistical Definitions

**Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE)** represents the smallest meaningful change in a metric that an experiment can reliably detect, forming the foundation for sample size calculations and experiment duration planning across all testing scenarios.

**Welch's T-test** serves as the primary statistical methodology for experimental result analysis, specifically engineered to handle unequal variances between experimental groups while maintaining rigorous statistical standards.

**Sample Size Target/Samples Per Variant Needed** defines calculated thresholds determining minimum user requirements per experimental variant to achieve statistical significance for specified MDE parameters.

**Two-sided vs One-sided Testing** distinguishes between statistical approaches where two-sided tests detect bidirectional changes (increases or decreases), while one-sided tests focus exclusively on detecting changes in predetermined directions.

**Sequential Testing** provides an alternative statistical methodology to traditional fixed-sample T-testing, enabling continuous monitoring capabilities and early stopping decision frameworks.

**Central Limit Theorem Assumptions** establish the statistical foundation underlying T-test validity, requiring sufficient sample sizes for proper distribution assumptions and reliable statistical inference.

## Ecosystem Integration and Platform Connectivity

The statistical analysis framework functions as the analytical backbone for Amplitude's broader experimentation ecosystem, connecting experiment design, execution, and analysis phases through integrated workflow systems. The **duration estimator** and **Cumulative Exposure graph** provide real-time experiment monitoring capabilities that integrate with broader product analytics and organizational decision-making systems.

Platform architecture supports both **binary metrics** (conversion-based measurements) and **continuous metrics** (value-based measurements), enabling comprehensive analysis across diverse business objectives and KPI frameworks. This flexibility facilitates integration across multiple product areas, including user acquisition, retention optimization, revenue enhancement, and feature adoption analysis.

**Business risk assessment** capabilities integrate MDE configuration with organizational decision-making processes, ensuring statistical rigor aligns with business impact thresholds and strategic resource allocation decisions.

## Technical Implementation and Interface Components

The system operates through the **Settings tab** interface, providing user access to the **Goals panel** for metric configuration and **Analysis Settings Stats Preferences** for statistical parameter definition. The **T-test duration estimator** delivers algorithmic sample size calculations based on MDE specifications, current traffic patterns, and desired statistical power requirements.

The platform automatically processes **false positive/negative rate** calculations and provides comprehensive guidance on **sample size threshold** requirements, ensuring experiments maintain statistical validity while optimizing for practical business constraints and organizational timeline requirements. This automated approach reduces technical complexity while preserving statistical rigor across all experimental implementations.
