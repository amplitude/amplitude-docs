# Amplitude Experiment: Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude Experiment is a statistical experimentation platform that enables product teams to design, run, and analyze experiments such as A/B tests and Multi-Armed Bandits. The platform helps users measure the impact of product changes through robust statistical analysis, allowing for data-driven decision making based on experimental results.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Experiment Analysis Tools
- **Welch's T-test**: A statistical method for comparing means between control and variant groups that accounts for different sample sizes and variances
- **Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE)**: Defines the smallest effect size that an experiment can reliably detect with statistical significance
- **Duration Estimator**: Calculates required experiment runtime based on parameters like MDE, sample size, and statistical power

### Experiment Types
- **A/B Testing**: Traditional hypothesis testing comparing a control group against one or more variants to determine which performs better
- **Multi-Armed Bandit**: Adaptive experimentation that dynamically allocates traffic to better-performing variants during the experiment, optimizing for outcomes in real-time

### Metrics Framework
- **Success Metrics**: Primary metrics that an experiment aims to improve (e.g., conversion rate, revenue)
- **Guardrail Metrics**: Secondary metrics monitored to ensure changes don't negatively impact other important aspects of the product
- **Recommendation Metrics**: Metrics that guide experiment decisions and help interpret results

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE)**: The smallest meaningful change in a metric that an experiment should be able to detect. Smaller MDEs require larger sample sizes.
- **Statistical Significance**: Typically expressed as a p-value, indicates the probability that observed results occurred by random chance rather than due to the tested variant.
- **Confidence Interval**: A range of values that likely contains the true effect size with a specified probability (typically 95%).
- **One-sided vs. Two-sided Tests**: Configuration options determining whether analysis looks for effects in one specific direction or in either direction.
- **Central Limit Theorem**: Statistical principle enabling T-tests to work with non-normal distributions when sample sizes are sufficiently large.
- **Peeking Problem**: Statistical issue that arises when repeatedly checking experiment results before reaching the predetermined sample size, which can lead to false positives.
- **Cumulative Exposure Graph**: Visualization showing the accumulation of users exposed to an experiment over time, helping monitor experiment progress.

## Statistical Analysis Configuration

### T-Test Configuration
- **One-sided Test**: Used when only interested in detecting effects in a specific direction (increase or decrease)
- **Two-sided Test**: Used when interested in detecting effects in either direction
- **Sample Size Requirements**: The T-test requires sufficient sample sizes (typically 100+ users per variant) for statistical validity

### MDE Configuration
- **Setting MDE by Experiment Type**: Different approaches for A/B tests versus Multi-Armed Bandits
- **MDE for Different Metrics**: Ability to set different MDEs for success metrics versus guardrail metrics
- **Risk Assessment**: Balancing the risks of false positives (Type I errors) and false negatives (Type II errors) when setting MDE

## Integration with Amplitude Ecosystem

Amplitude Experiment appears to be part of the broader Amplitude analytics ecosystem. While specific integration points aren't explicitly detailed in the provided documentation, the platform likely connects with other Amplitude products to provide:

1. User behavior data for experiment analysis
2. Cohort targeting capabilities
3. Comprehensive analytics dashboards
4. User segmentation for experiment design

The platform provides end-to-end experimentation capabilities from experiment design through statistical analysis and result interpretation, all within the Amplitude product suite.

## Technical Implementation

The documentation focuses on the theoretical aspects of experimentation rather than specific implementation details. However, it's clear that Amplitude Experiment offers a user interface for configuring statistical tests and experiment parameters, allowing users to customize:

- Statistical test types
- Confidence levels
- MDE thresholds
- Experiment duration calculations
- Analysis parameters for different metric types
