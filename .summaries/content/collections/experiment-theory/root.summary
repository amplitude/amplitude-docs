# Amplitude Experiment: Experimentation Platform

## Product Overview

Amplitude Experiment is a comprehensive platform for designing, executing, and analyzing controlled experiments (A/B tests and Multi-Armed Bandits) to drive data-driven product decisions. The platform enables product teams to test hypotheses about changes by comparing metrics between different user groups and determining the statistical significance of observed differences.

Amplitude Experiment provides robust statistical analysis tools, including Welch's T-test, experiment design capabilities with configurable parameters, sample size and duration estimation, real-time monitoring with Cumulative Exposure graphs, and support for both traditional A/B testing and more advanced Multi-Armed Bandit experiments. Users can configure Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE) settings to ensure experiments are properly powered to detect meaningful changes.

## Product Relationships and Features

Amplitude Experiment is part of the broader Amplitude analytics ecosystem, focusing specifically on experimentation capabilities. The platform consists of:

1. **Experiment Design Tools**: Features for configuring experiments with proper controls, variants, and parameters
2. **Statistical Analysis Engine**: Implementation of Welch's T-test and other statistical methods
3. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Real-time analysis tools including Cumulative Exposure graphs
4. **Duration Estimator**: Calculation of required sample sizes and experiment timeframes

The platform integrates with other Amplitude products to provide a comprehensive analytics solution, though specific integration points aren't fully detailed in the documentation.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Welch's T-test**: A statistical method for comparing means between two populations without assuming equal variances
- **Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE)**: The smallest meaningful change in a metric that an experiment aims to detect
- **One-sided vs. Two-sided Tests**: Configuration options where one-sided tests look for changes in a specific direction, while two-sided tests look for any change
- **Central Limit Theorem**: Statistical principle enabling normal distribution assumptions with sufficiently large sample sizes
- **Confidence Interval**: Range of values likely containing the true population parameter
- **Peeking**: The practice of checking experiment results prematurely, before reaching adequate sample size
- **Samples Per Variant Needed**: Required number of users in each experiment group for statistical validity
- **Cumulative Exposure Graph**: Visualization tracking user exposure to an experiment over time
- **Success Metrics**: Primary metrics an experiment aims to improve
- **Guardrail Metrics**: Secondary metrics monitored to ensure no negative side effects
- **Control Mean**: The baseline metric value in the control group

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Experiment functions as part of the larger Amplitude analytics and product optimization suite. The platform:

1. Likely receives user behavior data from Amplitude Analytics
2. Integrates with feature flag systems for experiment deployment
3. Feeds results back into broader product analytics dashboards
4. Supports data-driven decision-making processes for product teams

Experiment results can be analyzed within the Amplitude platform, indicating tight integration with other Amplitude tools and services.

## Technical Implementation

The platform appears to have a web-based interface where configurations and analyses are performed. Key technical capabilities include:

- Setting MDE values during experiment setup
- Configuring one-sided or two-sided T-tests
- Accessing Cumulative Exposure graphs for monitoring
- Using the duration estimator to calculate required sample sizes

Primary use cases include testing product changes before full deployment, measuring the impact of feature modifications on user behavior, optimizing conversion rates and other key metrics, and making data-driven product decisions based on statistically significant results.
