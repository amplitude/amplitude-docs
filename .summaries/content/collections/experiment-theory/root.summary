# Amplitude Experiment: Statistical Analysis and Experiment Design

Amplitude Experiment is a comprehensive experimentation platform that enables product teams to design, run, and analyze experiments for data-driven decision making. The platform combines statistical rigor with practical implementation tools to validate hypotheses about product changes.

## Key Features and Capabilities

### Experiment Analysis
- **Welch's T-test** methodology for comparing means between experiment variants without assuming equal variances
- **Statistical significance** determination to differentiate real effects from random chance
- **Confidence intervals** that estimate the true value of metrics with specified confidence levels
- **Peeking protection** to prevent statistical errors when checking results before experiment completion

### Experiment Design
- **Duration Estimator** that calculates required experiment runtime based on statistical parameters
- **Sample size calculation** to ensure experiments have sufficient statistical power
- **A/B Testing** for traditional hypothesis testing with control and treatment groups
- **Multi-Armed Bandit** experiments that adaptively allocate traffic to better-performing variants
- **Success and guardrail metrics** configuration to measure primary goals while monitoring for negative impacts

## Product Relationships and Architecture

Amplitude Experiment integrates experiment design and analysis in a structured workflow:

1. **Design Phase**: Users define experiment parameters including:
   - Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE) based on business objectives
   - Test configuration (one-sided vs. two-sided)
   - Required sample sizes per variant

2. **Execution Phase**: 
   - The platform tracks user interactions across variants
   - "Cumulative Exposure" visualizations monitor progress toward required sample sizes

3. **Analysis Phase**:
   - Statistical tests automatically evaluate variant performance
   - Results include significance levels, confidence intervals, and p-values
   - Visualization tools help interpret and communicate findings

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE)**: The smallest meaningful change in a metric that an experiment aims to detect with statistical significance
- **One-sided Test**: Evaluates if a variant is specifically better (or worse) than control
- **Two-sided Test**: Evaluates if a variant differs from control in either direction
- **Central Limit Theorem**: Statistical principle enabling normal distribution assumptions for sample means
- **Samples Per Variant Needed**: Required user count in each experiment group for statistical validity
- **Control Mean**: Baseline metric value in the control group used for comparison
- **Conversion Rate**: Percentage of users completing a desired action
- **Statistical Power**: Probability of detecting an effect of a given size if it exists (typically set at 80%)

## Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Experiment appears to be part of the broader Amplitude analytics ecosystem with:

- Integration with Amplitude's core analytics for metric definition and measurement
- Capabilities for tracking user behavior across experiment variants
- Tools designed for both technical and non-technical stakeholders

The platform bridges the gap between statistical theory and practical business application, enabling teams to design experiments that can detect meaningful changes while efficiently managing resources and timelines.
