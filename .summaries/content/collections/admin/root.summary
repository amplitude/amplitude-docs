## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Admin product is organized as a collection of related administrative tools that provide comprehensive management capabilities. The three main components (Account Management, Billing and Use, and Single Sign-On) are interconnected but serve distinct administrative functions.

The product appears to have a hierarchical organization with a central interface that allows users to navigate between different administrative sections. The landing page structure serves as the entry point to these various administrative functions.

## Key Nomenclature

- **Blueprint**: Template or schema definition for content pages
- **Landing**: Boolean flag indicating whether a page serves as a landing page
- **Current-collection**: Identifier for the active content collection being displayed
- **Template**: Defines the visual layout or rendering approach for a page

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Admin product serves as the administrative backbone for a larger platform or service ecosystem. It provides the necessary tools for managing users, controlling access, and handling financial aspects of the platform.

The Single Sign-On component indicates integration with external identity systems and enables access to multiple applications or services through a unified authentication mechanism. The modular structure suggests that the Admin product is part of a larger suite of tools or services that share common authentication and user management capabilities.
