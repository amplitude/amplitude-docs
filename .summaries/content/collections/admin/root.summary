# Admin Product Overview

The Admin product is a comprehensive management interface that provides administrative capabilities for account management, billing oversight, and authentication configuration. It serves as the central control panel for organizations to manage their resources, users, and service configurations.

## Key Features and Concepts

- **Account Management**: Tools for managing user accounts, permissions, and organizational settings
- **Billing and Usage Tracking**: Interfaces for monitoring service consumption, viewing invoices, and managing payment methods
- **Single Sign-On (SSO) Integration**: Enterprise authentication capabilities that connect with identity providers
- **Role-based Access Control**: Granular permission settings for different administrative functions

## Product Relationships and Features

The Admin product consists of three primary components:

1. **Account Management Module**: Handles user provisioning, role assignments, and organizational hierarchy. This module likely interfaces with user directories and permission systems.

2. **Billing and Use Module**: Provides visibility into resource consumption, cost allocation, and payment processing. This component connects to backend billing systems and potentially usage metrics collection services.

3. **Single Sign-On (SSO) Module**: Enables enterprise authentication through integration with identity providers like Okta, Azure AD, and others. This module serves as the authentication gateway for the entire product ecosystem.

These components work together to provide a unified administrative experience while addressing distinct operational needs.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Blueprint**: Schema definition that structures content and documentation, defining available fields and relationships
- **Landing**: Designation for pages that serve as entry points to specific documentation sections
- **Current-collection**: Reference to the active documentation collection being viewed or modified
- **Template**: Layout definition that controls how content is presented to users
- **Exclude_from_sitemap**: Configuration flag to prevent specific pages from appearing in site navigation or search indexes
- **Identity Provider (IdP)**: External authentication service that verifies user identities in SSO implementations
- **Service Provider (SP)**: The application or service that relies on the IdP for authentication (in this context, the Admin product)

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Admin product serves as the administrative backbone for a larger service ecosystem. It provides the governance layer that enables:

1. User management across all connected services
2. Centralized billing and resource allocation
3. Unified authentication through SSO capabilities

The documentation structure suggests a modular approach where the Admin product can be extended with additional administrative capabilities as needed. The presence of collection-based organization indicates that the product documentation is part of a larger knowledge base or developer portal.

The SSO integration points to enterprise-grade capabilities designed for organizations with existing identity management systems, suggesting this product targets business or enterprise customers rather than individual users.
