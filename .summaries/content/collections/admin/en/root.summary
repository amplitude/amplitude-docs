The Admin product appears to be a management interface or portal that provides administrative capabilities for a broader system or platform. It includes features for account management, billing oversight, and authentication controls.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Admin product appears to be organized as a collection of related administrative tools that work together to provide comprehensive management capabilities. The three main components (Account Management, Billing and Use, and Single Sign-On) are likely interconnected but serve distinct administrative functions.

The landing page structure suggests a hierarchical organization where users can navigate between different administrative sections from a central interface.

The Single Sign-On component suggests integration with external identity systems and potentially enables access to multiple applications or services through a unified authentication mechanism.

The modular structure implies that the Admin product may be part of a larger suite of tools or services that share common authentication and user management capabilities.
