## Product Overview

This documentation directory covers the administrative functionality of a software platform that provides enterprise-level user management capabilities. The system includes comprehensive account management, billing and usage tracking, and Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication services.

## Product Relationships and Features

The administrative module consists of three core interconnected components:

**Account Management** - Serves as the central hub for user administration, providing tools and interfaces for managing user accounts, permissions, and organizational structures within the platform.

**Billing and Use** - Handles financial operations and usage analytics, tracking resource consumption, managing subscription plans, and providing billing oversight for organizational accounts.

**Single Sign-On** - Provides enterprise authentication services, enabling users to access the platform through existing identity providers and centralized authentication systems.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Blueprint**: `admin` - Indicates these are administrative-level documentation pages with elevated permissions and functionality
- **Landing Page Template** - Used for Account Management and Single Sign-On, suggesting these are primary entry points with navigation to sub-features
- **Current Collection** - References the active administrative domain (account-management, single-sign-on)
- **Exclude from Sitemap** - All pages are set to false, indicating full visibility in documentation navigation

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The administrative module operates as a foundational layer within the broader platform ecosystem. The SSO functionality suggests integration with external identity providers and enterprise directory services. The billing component indicates a SaaS or usage-based business model with metered services. Account management serves as the orchestration layer, coordinating between authentication, authorization, and billing systems.

The presence of collection-based organization and blueprint architecture indicates this is part of a larger content management or documentation system, likely built on a headless CMS platform that supports structured content types and hierarchical organization.

## Technical Implementation

The documentation structure uses a YAML frontmatter format with unique identifiers (UUIDs) for each administrative component. The system tracks content updates with user attribution and timestamps, suggesting an audit trail for administrative changes. The template system differentiates between landing pages (for major feature areas) and standard pages (for detailed functionality), indicating a hierarchical information architecture designed for enterprise users navigating complex administrative workflows.
