## Amplitude Experiment Contentful Integration

Amplitude Experiment's Contentful integration is a specialized plugin that enables content-driven A/B testing and experimentation workflows by bridging Amplitude's feature flagging system with Contentful's content management capabilities. This integration allows marketing teams, content creators, and product managers to conduct sophisticated content experiments without requiring engineering resources for each test iteration.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The integration operates through a plugin architecture that establishes direct connections between experiment configurations and content variants. The core workflow centers around the **Variant Container content model**, which serves as a specialized Contentful content type that organizes and manages multiple content variants for experimentation. This container acts as a wrapper that holds different versions of content that can be dynamically served to users based on experiment allocation.

The system utilizes Contentful's **Reference Field Type** to establish relationships between Variant Containers and actual content variants, enabling flexible content organization. Content delivery occurs through Contentful's **JSON API response** system, which embeds experiment metadata alongside content data, ensuring that experiment information travels with content for real-time variant selection.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Variant Container Content Model**: The primary content type that serves as a central hub for managing all variations of content being tested in an experiment.

**Flag Key**: A unique identifier that creates the bridge between Amplitude Experiment flags and specific Contentful content variants, enabling seamless integration between the two systems.

**variationsCollection**: A structured collection within Contentful containing all different content variants associated with a particular experiment, dynamically populated based on experiment configuration.

**bucketingKey**: An identifier used for consistent user bucketing, ensuring users receive the same content variant across sessions.

**rolloutWeights**: Configuration parameters defining percentage distribution of traffic across content variants, enabling controlled content rollouts.

## API Integration and Technical Implementation

The integration leverages multiple API layers for comprehensive functionality:

- **Contentful Management API**: Used for configuration, setup, and content model management, requiring appropriate API keys for authentication
- **@amplitude/experiment-js-client**: JavaScript library providing client-side experiment resolution and variant selection
- **experiment.variant()**: Primary method for variant resolution that determines appropriate content variants based on user bucketing and experiment configuration

The system integrates with Contentful's JSON API response system to deliver content with embedded experiment metadata, enabling real-time variant selection without additional API calls.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Within Amplitude's product ecosystem, the Contentful integration extends Amplitude Experiment's capabilities into content management workflows, creating a unified experimentation platform that spans both product functionality and content presentation. This enables teams to conduct comprehensive A/B testing scenarios where content variants can be tested alongside feature flags and product changes.

The integration maintains full compatibility with existing Amplitude analytics and reporting infrastructure, ensuring content experiment results integrate seamlessly with broader product analytics and user behavior tracking systems. This holistic approach enables simultaneous optimization of user experience and content effectiveness, providing teams with a complete view of how both product features and content variations impact user behavior and business outcomes.
