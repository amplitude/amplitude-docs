## Amplitude Experiment Contentful Integration

Amplitude Experiment offers a specialized integration with Contentful CMS that transforms content management into an experimentation platform. This integration enables content-driven A/B testing workflows where marketing teams, content creators, and product managers can test different content variants directly within their CMS while leveraging Amplitude's robust experimentation infrastructure for traffic allocation, user targeting, and performance analytics.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The integration establishes a sophisticated bridge between Amplitude Experiment's feature flagging system and Contentful's content management capabilities through several interconnected components:

**Variant Container Content Model** serves as the foundational architecture, acting as a wrapper that organizes and houses multiple content variations for experimental testing. This model creates a structured approach to content variation management within Contentful's native interface.

**Flag Keys** function as the critical linking mechanism, creating a direct mapping between experiment configurations in Amplitude and corresponding Variant Containers in Contentful. This mapping enables seamless content variant delivery based on real-time experiment allocation decisions.

**Authentication Layer** utilizes Contentful Management API keys to establish secure, persistent communication channels between the platforms, providing necessary permissions for content retrieval and metadata access.

**Content Delivery Engine** operates through a variationsCollection object that dynamically serves different content options based on user experiment assignments, with real-time updates occurring every 5 seconds to ensure content changes are immediately reflected in live experiments.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Variant Container**: The primary content model that wraps and organizes experimental content variations within Contentful's structure

**Flag Keys**: Unique identifiers that create bidirectional mapping between Amplitude experiments and Contentful content containers

**Management API Keys**: Contentful authentication credentials that enable secure platform-to-platform communication

**variationsCollection Object**: The data structure containing all available content variants for a specific experiment

**bucketingKey amplitude_id**: User identification mechanism ensuring consistent experiment allocation across sessions

**rolloutWeights**: Configuration parameters controlling traffic distribution percentages across content variants

**ExperimentId Mapping**: The connection system linking Amplitude's tracking infrastructure with Contentful's content delivery

**Meta Object Variant Matching**: The algorithmic process comparing user characteristics against available content variants

**Reference Field Configuration**: Contentful's relationship structure connecting main content with experimental variants

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Within Amplitude's experimentation ecosystem, the Contentful integration represents a strategic expansion beyond traditional feature flagging into content management workflows. This positions Amplitude Experiment as a comprehensive experimentation platform capable of supporting both technical feature experiments and marketing-driven content tests.

The integration supports modern headless CMS architectures and contemporary content delivery patterns, making it compatible with web applications, mobile apps, and diverse digital experiences that depend on Contentful for content management while requiring sophisticated experimentation capabilities.

This integration eliminates the traditional barrier between content teams and experimentation programs, enabling non-technical stakeholders to design, launch, and iterate on content experiments without requiring engineering intervention for each test cycle.

## Technical Implementation Details

**API Integration**: The system utilizes the `@amplitude/experiment-js-client` library, specifically leveraging the `experiment.variant()` method for real-time variant determination and content delivery.

**Refresh Mechanism**: Automated 5-second refresh intervals ensure property updates and content changes propagate from Contentful to live experiments without manual intervention or application restarts.

**User Targeting**: The integration employs amplitude_id as the primary bucketingKey for consistent user identification and experiment allocation across sessions and touchpoints.

**Content Synchronization**: Real-time synchronization between Contentful content updates and Amplitude experiment configurations ensures content variants remain current and properly attributed for analytics collection.
