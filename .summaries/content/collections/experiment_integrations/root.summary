# Amplitude Experiment Integrations: Contentful Plugin

## Overview
Amplitude Experiment is a platform that enables A/B testing and feature flagging capabilities across different content management systems. The Contentful plugin allows users to create and manage content variations within Contentful while controlling these experiments through Amplitude Experiment.

## Key Features and Use Cases
- Create content variations in Contentful for A/B testing
- Control which content variations are shown to users through Amplitude Experiment
- Retrieve experiment metadata through JSON responses
- Integrate experimental content into front-end applications seamlessly
- Manage experiment variants without changing application code

## Product Relationships and Architecture
The Contentful plugin connects Amplitude Experiment with the Contentful content management system through the following workflow:

1. Content variations are created in Contentful using Variant Containers
2. These variations are linked to experiments in Amplitude Experiment via Flag Keys
3. The Contentful plugin queries Amplitude Experiment to determine which content variation to serve
4. Front-end applications receive the appropriate content variation along with experiment metadata

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions
- **Variant Container**: A Contentful content type that holds different variations of content for experimentation
- **Flag Key**: A unique identifier connecting a Contentful experiment to an Amplitude Experiment flag
- **Reference Field**: A Contentful field that links to other content entries, used to associate variants with containers
- **Experiment Metadata**: Information about the experiment included in JSON responses, containing variant details and tracking information
- **Management API Key**: Contentful credential required for plugin installation
- **Amplitude Org URL**: Organization-specific URL for Amplitude Experiment API access

## Integration with Broader Ecosystem
The Contentful plugin is part of Amplitude's experimentation platform, which likely includes integrations with other content management systems and application frameworks. The plugin extends Contentful's content model with experimentation capabilities while maintaining a headless architecture:

- Content management occurs in Contentful
- Experiment configuration happens in Amplitude Experiment
- Front-end applications consume content via APIs
- Experiment results are tracked in Amplitude's analytics platform

## API and Implementation Details
The integration provides JSON responses containing:
- Content variation data
- Experiment metadata including flag key, variant details, user assignment information, and tracking metadata

Implementation requires:
1. Installing the Contentful plugin
2. Configuring variant containers in Contentful
3. Creating content variations
4. Integrating with front-end code to handle JSON responses
5. Using experiment metadata for tracking and analysis

The plugin requires Contentful Management API keys and Amplitude Organization URLs for configuration and authentication between systems.
