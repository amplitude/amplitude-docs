# Amplitude Experiment Integrations: Contentful

## Overview
Amplitude Experiment is a platform that enables A/B testing and feature flagging across various content management systems and platforms. The integration with Contentful allows content creators to define and manage content variations directly within Contentful, while using Amplitude Experiment to control which variations are shown to users.

## Key Features
- Create content variations within Contentful's content management system
- Control which variations are shown to users through Amplitude Experiment
- Seamless integration between content management and experimentation
- Front-end implementation for rendering appropriate content variants
- Support for A/B testing of content without requiring developer intervention for each test

## Core Concepts and Nomenclature

### Variant Container
A specialized content type in Contentful that holds different variations of content for experimentation. It contains:
- A reference field that links to different content variations
- Metadata about the experiment, including the flag key used in Amplitude Experiment

### Flag Key
A unique identifier that connects the content in Contentful to the experiment configuration in Amplitude Experiment. This key is used to retrieve the appropriate variant decision for each user.

### Variations Collection
A collection of content variations in Contentful that can be selected based on experiment decisions. These are referenced from the Variant Container.

### Meta Object
Contains experiment metadata within the Contentful response, including the flag key that should be used to determine which variant to display.

## Integration Architecture

### Content Model Configuration
1. Content models in Contentful must be configured with variant containers
2. Each variant container includes:
   - A reference field to the content variations
   - Metadata fields for experiment configuration

### Front-end Implementation
The front-end application needs to:
1. Fetch content from Contentful, including variant containers
2. Extract the flag key from the meta object
3. Use Amplitude Experiment's client SDK to get a variant decision based on the flag key
4. Render the appropriate content variation based on the decision

### API and Implementation Details
The integration uses:
- Contentful's Management API (requires API key for configuration)
- Contentful's Content Delivery API for retrieving content
- Amplitude Experiment's client SDK, specifically the `experiment.variant()` method to get variant decisions

### JSON Response Structure
When fetching content from Contentful that includes a variant container, the response includes:
```json
{
  "variationsCollection": {
    "items": [
      // Content variations
    ]
  },
  "meta": {
    "flagKey": "example-flag-key"
  }
}
```

## Product Ecosystem
Amplitude Experiment appears to be part of a broader Amplitude analytics and experimentation platform, with various integrations for different content management systems and platforms. The Contentful integration is one of potentially many integrations that allow Amplitude Experiment to control content variations across different systems.

The integration leverages Contentful's content modeling capabilities while using Amplitude's experimentation infrastructure to make decisions about which content to show to users, creating a seamless workflow for content-focused experimentation.
