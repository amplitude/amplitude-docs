## Amplitude Experiment Contentful Integration

Amplitude Experiment provides a specialized integration with Contentful CMS that enables content-driven A/B testing and experimentation workflows. This integration allows teams to test different content variants directly within their content management system while leveraging Amplitude's experimentation infrastructure.

## Core Integration Architecture

The Contentful integration operates through a dedicated plugin that bridges Amplitude Experiment's feature flagging capabilities with Contentful's content modeling system. The integration establishes a bidirectional relationship where:

- **Contentful serves as the content variant repository** - Different versions of content are stored and managed within Contentful's content models
- **Amplitude Experiment handles the experimentation logic** - User bucketing, rollout weights, and experiment metadata are managed through Amplitude's systems
- **The plugin synchronizes experiment configuration** - Flag keys and experiment parameters are shared between both platforms

## Key Components and Nomenclature

**Variant Container Content Model**: A specialized Contentful content model that serves as the primary structure for organizing experiment variants. This model acts as a container that groups different content variations for a single experiment.

**Flag Key**: The unique identifier that links Amplitude Experiment flags to specific Contentful content variants. This key serves as the bridge between the experimentation platform and the content management system.

**Management API Key**: Authentication credential required for the Contentful plugin to access and modify content models and entries through Contentful's Management API.

**variationsCollection**: A structured object within the JSON API response that contains the collection of content variants available for an experiment, along with their associated metadata.

**bucketingKey**: User identifier used by Amplitude Experiment to consistently assign users to specific content variants across sessions.

**rolloutWeights**: Configuration parameters that determine the percentage distribution of users across different content variants in an experiment.

**Reference Field Type**: Contentful's field type used to create relationships between the Variant Container and actual content entries, enabling dynamic content selection based on experiment results.

## Technical Implementation

The integration utilizes both client-side and server-side components:

**Client-Side Integration**:
- `@amplitude/experiment-js-client` - JavaScript SDK for retrieving experiment variants
- `experiment.variant()` - Method call to fetch the appropriate content variant for a user
- `contentful-sdk` - Contentful's SDK for retrieving content based on experiment results

**API Structure**:
The integration produces JSON API responses containing experiment metadata and variationsCollection objects that include:
- Content variant identifiers
- Experiment configuration parameters  
- User bucketing information
- Rollout weight distributions

## Ecosystem Integration

Within the broader Amplitude product ecosystem, the Contentful integration represents a content-focused extension of Amplitude Experiment's core feature flagging capabilities. This integration enables marketing teams, content creators, and product managers to:

- Test different messaging, copy, and creative assets without requiring engineering resources
- Leverage Amplitude's robust experimentation infrastructure while maintaining content workflows in Contentful
- Analyze content performance using Amplitude's analytics capabilities
- Implement personalization strategies based on user segments and behavioral data

The integration maintains consistency with Amplitude Experiment's standard bucketing algorithms and statistical analysis methods while extending the platform's reach into content management workflows.
