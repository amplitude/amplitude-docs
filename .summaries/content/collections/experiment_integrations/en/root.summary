## Amplitude Experiment Contentful Integration

Amplitude Experiment provides a specialized integration with Contentful CMS that enables content-driven A/B testing and experimentation workflows. This integration allows teams to test different content variants directly within their content management system while leveraging Amplitude's experimentation infrastructure.

## Core Integration Architecture

The Contentful integration operates through a plugin architecture that bridges Amplitude Experiment's feature flagging system with Contentful's content modeling capabilities. The integration establishes a direct connection between experiment configurations and content variants, enabling seamless content testing without requiring separate content management workflows.

The system utilizes Contentful's **Variant Container content model** as the primary mechanism for organizing and managing experiment content. This content model serves as a wrapper that contains multiple content variants for testing, with each variant representing a different version of content that can be served to users based on experiment allocation.

## Key Components and Nomenclature

**Variant Container Content Model**: A specialized Contentful content type that organizes multiple content variants for experimentation. This model acts as the central hub for managing all variations of a particular piece of content being tested.

**Flag Key**: A unique identifier that links Amplitude Experiment flags to specific Contentful content variants. This key serves as the bridge between the experimentation platform and the content management system.

**variationsCollection**: A structured collection within Contentful that contains all the different content variants associated with a particular experiment. This collection is dynamically populated based on experiment configuration.

**bucketingKey**: An identifier used to determine which variant a specific user should receive, ensuring consistent content delivery across user sessions.

**rolloutWeights**: Configuration parameters that define the percentage distribution of traffic across different content variants, enabling controlled rollout of content changes.

**Reference Field Type**: Contentful's field type used to establish relationships between the Variant Container and actual content variants, enabling flexible content organization.

## API Integration and Implementation

The integration leverages Contentful's **Management API** for configuration and setup, requiring appropriate API keys for authentication and content model management. The system integrates with the **@amplitude/experiment-js-client** library to provide client-side experiment resolution and variant selection.

Content delivery occurs through Contentful's **JSON API response** system, which includes embedded experiment metadata alongside content data. This approach ensures that experiment information travels with content, enabling real-time variant selection and delivery.

The primary method for variant resolution is the **experiment.variant()** function, which determines the appropriate content variant based on user bucketing and experiment configuration. This function integrates seamlessly with existing Amplitude Experiment workflows while providing content-specific functionality.

## Ecosystem Integration

Within the broader Amplitude product ecosystem, the Contentful integration extends Amplitude Experiment's capabilities into content management workflows. This integration enables marketing teams, content creators, and product managers to conduct sophisticated content experiments without requiring engineering resources for each test iteration.

The integration supports comprehensive A/B testing scenarios where content variants can be tested alongside feature flags and product changes, providing a unified experimentation platform that spans both product functionality and content presentation. This holistic approach enables teams to optimize both user experience and content effectiveness simultaneously.

The system maintains compatibility with existing Amplitude analytics and reporting infrastructure, ensuring that content experiment results integrate with broader product analytics and user behavior tracking systems.
