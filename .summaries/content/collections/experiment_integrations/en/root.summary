## Amplitude Experiment Contentful Integration

Amplitude Experiment provides a specialized integration with Contentful CMS that enables content-driven A/B testing and experimentation workflows. This integration allows teams to test different content variants directly within their content management system while leveraging Amplitude's experimentation infrastructure for traffic allocation and analytics.

## Core Integration Architecture

The Contentful plugin establishes a bridge between Amplitude Experiment's feature flagging system and Contentful's content management capabilities. The integration operates through a **Variant Container content model** that serves as the primary mechanism for organizing and delivering experimental content variants. This model acts as a wrapper that contains multiple content variations for testing purposes.

The system utilizes **Flag Keys** as the primary identifier linking Amplitude experiments to specific Contentful content containers. These Flag Keys create a mapping between the experiment configuration in Amplitude and the corresponding Variant Container in Contentful, enabling seamless content variant delivery based on experiment allocation.

## Key Technical Components

### Authentication and Configuration
The integration requires **Management API keys** from Contentful to establish secure communication between the two platforms. These keys provide the necessary permissions for the Amplitude Experiment system to retrieve content variants and metadata from Contentful spaces.

### Content Delivery Mechanism
Content variants are delivered through a **variationsCollection object** that contains the different content options for each experiment. The system uses the **experiment.variant() method** from the **@amplitude/experiment-js-client** to determine which content variant should be served to each user based on their experiment allocation.

### Real-time Content Updates
The integration features a **5-second refresh interval** for property updates, ensuring that content changes made in Contentful are quickly reflected in the live experiment without requiring application restarts or manual cache clearing.

## Experiment Configuration and Targeting

The system employs **bucketingKey amplitude_id** for user identification and experiment allocation, ensuring consistent user experiences across sessions. Experiment traffic distribution is controlled through **rolloutWeights** configuration, allowing precise control over what percentage of users see each content variant.

**ExperimentId mapping** creates the connection between Amplitude's experiment tracking system and Contentful's content delivery, enabling proper attribution and analytics collection for each content variant's performance.

## Variant Selection and Delivery

Content variant selection utilizes a **meta object variant matching** system that compares user characteristics and experiment allocation against the available content variants in the Variant Container. This matching process ensures users receive the appropriate content based on their experiment group assignment.

The **Reference field configuration** within Contentful content models enables the creation of relationships between the main content and its experimental variants, providing a structured approach to content variation management.

## Integration Ecosystem Position

This Contentful integration positions Amplitude Experiment as a comprehensive experimentation platform that extends beyond traditional feature flags into content management workflows. It enables marketing teams, content creators, and product managers to collaborate on content experiments without requiring engineering intervention for each test iteration.

The integration supports headless CMS architectures and modern content delivery patterns, making it suitable for web applications, mobile apps, and other digital experiences that rely on Contentful for content management while requiring sophisticated experimentation capabilities.
