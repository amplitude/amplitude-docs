# Amplitude Experiment: Product Overview

Amplitude Experiment is a comprehensive experimentation and feature flagging platform that enables product teams to test hypotheses, validate ideas, and safely roll out new features. It supports both traditional A/B testing and advanced Multi-Armed Bandit experiments for data-driven product development.

## Key Features and Capabilities

- **Dual Functionality**: Serves as both an experimentation platform and a feature flag management system
- **Experiment Types**: Supports A/B/n testing and Multi-Armed Bandit experiments with Thompson sampling
- **Evaluation Modes**: Offers both remote (server-side) and local (client-side) evaluation options
- **Statistical Analysis**: Built-in tools for significance testing, sample size calculation, and experiment duration estimation
- **Targeting**: Granular audience targeting capabilities to test with specific user segments
- **Metrics Framework**: Supports recommendation metrics, guardrail metrics, and secondary metrics

## Product Architecture and Relationships

Amplitude Experiment is structured around several key components that work together:

1. **Deployments**: Configuration entities that connect to Amplitude Analytics projects and require SDK installation
   - Client-side deployments for web/mobile applications
   - Server-side deployments for backend services

2. **Experiments**: Test configurations that include:
   - Variants (different versions of a feature)
   - Audience targeting rules
   - Metrics for success measurement
   - Statistical parameters

3. **Feature Flags**: Configuration toggles that enable:
   - Gradual rollouts with percentage controls
   - Targeted releases to specific user segments
   - Kill switches for emergency feature disabling

4. **SDKs**: Client libraries that handle:
   - User context management
   - Variant assignment logic
   - Exposure event tracking
   - Feature flag evaluation

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Experiment Concepts
- **Experiment Key**: Unique identifier for an experiment
- **Bucketing Unit**: Entity level for variant assignment (user_id, device_id, etc.)
- **Bucketing Salt**: Value ensuring consistent variant assignment
- **Exposure Event**: Event that triggers a user's inclusion in an experiment
- **Variant()**: Function determining which variant a user receives

### Statistical Terms
- **Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE)**: Smallest meaningful difference the experiment can detect
- **CUPED**: Controlled-experiment Using Pre-Existing Data, a variance reduction technique
- **Bonferroni Correction**: Method addressing multiple hypothesis testing
- **Sequential Test**: Approach allowing continuous monitoring of results

### Feature Flag Terms
- **Rollout Percentage**: Controls what portion of users receive a feature
- **Sticky Bucketing**: Ensures users consistently receive the same variant

## Integration with Amplitude Ecosystem

Amplitude Experiment integrates deeply with other Amplitude products:

1. **Amplitude Analytics**: 
   - Shares user identifiers (Device ID, User ID) for consistent tracking
   - Uses Analytics events as metrics for experiment evaluation
   - Leverages Analytics cohorts for audience targeting

2. **Amplitude Audiences**:
   - Enables targeting specific user segments in experiments
   - Provides dynamic audience updates based on user behavior

The platform fits into the broader product development workflow by:
- Supporting hypothesis testing through controlled experiments
- Enabling feature releases without code deployments
- Providing data-driven insights for product decisions

## Technical Implementation

### SDK Implementation
```javascript
// Initialize the Amplitude Experiment SDK
const experiment = new Experiment({
  apiKey: 'deployment-key-here'
});

// Set user context
experiment.setUser({
  user_id: 'user-123',
  device_id: 'device-456',
  user_properties: {
    premium: true
  }
});

// Fetch variants
const variants = await experiment.fetch();

// Access a specific variant
const buttonVariant = variants.variant('button-color-test');
if (buttonVariant.value === 'blue') {
  // Implement blue button
} else {
  // Implement default button
}

// Track exposure
experiment.exposure('button-color-test');
```

### Implementation Workflow
1. Configure a deployment in Amplitude Experiment
2. Install the appropriate SDK for your platform
3. Initialize the SDK with deployment keys
4. Set user context for proper variant assignment
5. Implement exposure event tracking
6. Access variant assignments in code
7. Monitor results in the Amplitude Experiment dashboard

### QA Testing Features
- Force variant assignment for specific user IDs
- Diagnostic tools to verify implementation
- Troubleshooting features for variant assignment issues

The platform supports a complete experimentation workflow from hypothesis formation through analysis and decision-making, with tools for each stage of the process.
