**Summary:** This documentation covers the experiment analysis workflow in Amplitude Experiment, detailing how to interpret experimental results through various cards including Filter, Data Quality, Summary, Analysis, and Diagnostics cards, with specific focus on statistical significance thresholds (100 users + 25 conversions for binary metrics, 100 users for non-binary metrics) and p-value calculations.
