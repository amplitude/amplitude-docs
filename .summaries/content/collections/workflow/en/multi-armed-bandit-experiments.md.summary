## Summary
This documentation explains multi-armed bandit experiments in Amplitude Experiment, which automatically reallocate traffic to better-performing variants using Thompson sampling, unlike traditional A/B tests that wait for statistical significance before making decisions. The page details setup requirements, differences from A/B tests, and how traffic allocation automatically adjusts based on performance data.
