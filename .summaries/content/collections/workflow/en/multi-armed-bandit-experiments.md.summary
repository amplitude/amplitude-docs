## Summary
This documentation explains multi-armed bandit experiments in Amplitude Experiment, which automatically reallocate traffic to better-performing variants using Thompson sampling, unlike traditional A/B tests that wait for statistical significance before making decisions. The page details key differences in setup, metrics requirements, traffic allocation, and result displays compared to standard A/B tests.
