**Summary:** This documentation covers defining experiment goals in Amplitude Experiment, including setting up recommendation and guardrail metrics, creating custom metrics with seven specific types (unique conversions, event totals, formula, funnel conversions, return on retention, sum of property value, average of property value), configuring minimum detectable effect, and defining exposure events including the Amplitude exposure event triggered by `.variant()` calls.
