## Amplitude Experiment: Comprehensive Experimentation and Feature Flag Platform

Amplitude Experiment is a comprehensive experimentation and feature flag platform that enables teams to run A/B tests, multi-armed bandit experiments, and manage feature rollouts. The platform provides both remote and local evaluation modes, supports various bucketing strategies, and offers sophisticated statistical analysis tools for experiment optimization.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The platform operates through a hierarchical structure where **deployments** serve as the foundational configuration layer, containing access keys and SDK settings for either client-side or server-side implementations. Within deployments, teams can create **experiments** (A/B tests or multi-armed bandit) and **feature flags** for controlled rollouts.

**Experiments** follow a structured workflow: creation → audience definition → variant configuration → goal setting → statistical preference finalization → testing → launch → analysis. Each experiment contains multiple **variants** with customizable traffic distribution, payload configurations, and rollout controls. The platform supports **stratified sampling** with segment-specific rollout percentages and **sticky bucketing** to ensure consistent user experiences.

**Feature flags** operate similarly but focus on feature rollouts rather than hypothesis testing, using percentage-based rollouts and weight distribution between variants without requiring statistical significance testing.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Bucketing Units**: The entity used for experiment assignment (User ID, Device ID, or custom company ID), following the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA)

**Evaluation Modes**: 
- **Remote Evaluation**: Server-side variant assignment with real-time targeting
- **Local Evaluation**: Client-side evaluation using cached configurations

**Variants**: Different versions of an experiment including control baseline and treatment variants, each with names, values (slugified), payloads (JSON), and traffic allocation percentages

**Exposure Events**: Triggered by `.variant()` SDK calls, indicating when users encounter experiment variants, distinct from assignment events

**User Segments**: Targeting rules based on cohorts, user properties, or custom properties that determine bucketing eligibility

**Statistical Methods**:
- **CUPED**: Controlled-experiment using pre-existing data for variance reduction
- **Bonferroni Correction**: Multiple hypothesis testing adjustment
- **Sequential Testing**: Continuous monitoring vs traditional T-test approaches
- **Thompson Sampling**: Algorithm used in multi-armed bandit experiments for traffic reallocation

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Experiment integrates deeply with the Amplitude Analytics ecosystem, leveraging user cohorts, behavioral data, and event tracking for sophisticated targeting and analysis. The platform connects with:

- **Amplitude Analytics**: For user segmentation, cohort creation, and behavioral targeting
- **Amplitude Data**: For custom user properties and real-time property evaluation
- **Third-party Tools**: Through REST API endpoints and webhook integrations
- **Development Workflows**: Via multiple SDKs supporting various programming languages and frameworks

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

The platform provides several technical interfaces:

**REST API**: Evaluation endpoints for flag and experiment variant retrieval
**SDK Integration**: Multiple language-specific SDKs with `.variant()` method calls for exposure tracking
**Deployment Access Keys**: Authentication tokens for client-side and server-side implementations
**QA Tester ID Assignment**: Special targeting for pre-launch testing and validation

## Advanced Features and Capabilities

**Multi-Armed Bandit Experiments**: Enterprise-level feature using Thompson sampling for automated traffic optimization based on primary metrics, available with `ampex_data_monster` configuration

**Duration Estimation**: Statistical tools calculating sample size requirements based on confidence levels, minimum detectable effect (MDE), power analysis, and control group performance metrics

**Comprehensive Analytics**: Results analysis through Filter, Data Quality, Summary, Analysis, and Diagnostics cards, with support for sample ratio mismatch detection, variant jumping analysis, and cumulative exposure tracking

**Rollout Management**: Sophisticated deployment controls including percentage rollouts, weight distribution, scheduled launches, and completion options (rollout, rollback, continue)

The platform emphasizes statistical rigor while providing practical tools for both technical and non-technical users to design, execute, and analyze experiments effectively within modern product development workflows.
