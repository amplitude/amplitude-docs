## Amplitude Experiment: Comprehensive Experimentation and Feature Flag Platform

Amplitude Experiment is a comprehensive experimentation and feature flag management platform that enables organizations to conduct A/B tests, multi-armed bandit experiments, and feature rollouts. The platform provides both client-side and server-side evaluation capabilities with sophisticated targeting, statistical analysis, and automated optimization features.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The platform operates through a hierarchical structure centered around **deployments** - distinct environments (client-side vs server-side) that contain experiments and feature flags. Each deployment has unique access keys and integrates with Experiment SDKs or REST APIs for variant evaluation.

**Experiments** can be configured as traditional A/B tests or multi-armed bandit experiments. A/B tests use statistical significance testing with configurable methods (sequential testing vs T-tests), while multi-armed bandit experiments employ Thompson sampling for automated traffic reallocation based on performance metrics.

**Feature flags** operate as simplified experiments focused on feature rollouts rather than hypothesis testing, using percentage-based traffic allocation and user segment targeting without statistical analysis requirements.

The experimentation workflow follows a structured pipeline: experiment creation → audience definition → goal configuration → variant setup → delivery configuration → statistical preferences → testing/QA → launch → analysis → completion.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Bucketing Units**: The entity level for experiment assignment (User, Company ID, or custom identifiers), ensuring consistent variant assignment across user sessions.

**Evaluation Modes**: 
- **Remote Evaluation**: Server-side variant assignment with real-time targeting
- **Local Evaluation**: Client-side evaluation using cached experiment configurations

**Variants**: Different experiment treatments including control baselines and treatment variants, each with configurable names, values, payloads (JSON), and traffic distribution percentages.

**Exposure Events**: Analytics events triggered when users encounter experiment variants, distinct from assignment events and required for statistical analysis.

**User Segments**: Targeting rules based on cohorts, user properties, or custom properties that determine experiment eligibility and bucketing.

**Sticky Bucketing**: Ensures users remain in assigned variants throughout experiment duration, preventing variant jumping that could compromise statistical validity.

**Stratified Sampling**: Advanced traffic allocation allowing different rollout percentages per user segment while maintaining uniform allocation ratios within segments.

## Statistical and Analysis Framework

The platform implements sophisticated statistical methodologies including:

**CUPED (Controlled-experiment using Pre-existing data)**: Variance reduction technique using pre-exposure data to improve statistical power.

**Sequential Testing**: Continuous monitoring approach allowing early experiment termination when statistical significance is reached.

**Bonferroni Correction**: Multiple hypothesis testing adjustment to control false positive rates across multiple metrics.

**Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM) Detection**: Automated diagnostics to identify traffic allocation irregularities.

Statistical significance thresholds require minimum sample sizes: 100 users + 25 conversions for binary metrics, 100 users for non-binary metrics.

## Integration and Technical Implementation

**SDK Integration**: Multi-language SDKs for client-side and server-side implementation with user context handling for variant assignment.

**REST API**: Evaluation endpoints for flag/experiment variant retrieval without SDK integration.

**User Context Object**: Standardized data structure containing user identifiers (user_id, device_id), properties, and custom attributes for targeting evaluation.

**Deployment Access Keys**: Authentication tokens for SDK/API communication with specific deployment environments.

## Experiment Lifecycle Management

**QA and Testing**: Test Instrumentation functionality allows designated testers to validate experiment variants before full rollout.

**Scheduling**: Experiments can be scheduled for automatic start times with configurable rollout parameters.

**Completion Options**:
- **Rollout**: Deploy winning variant to 100% of traffic
- **Rollback**: Revert to control variant
- **Continue**: Extend experiment duration

**Diagnostics and Troubleshooting**: Comprehensive monitoring for variant delivery issues, user bucketing inconsistencies, and targeting property synchronization problems.

## Advanced Experimentation Features

**Multi-Armed Bandit Experiments**: Enterprise-level automated optimization using Thompson sampling for dynamic traffic reallocation based on primary optimization metrics, eliminating the need for traditional statistical significance testing.

**Mutual Exclusion Groups**: Traffic management to prevent user overlap between conflicting experiments.

**Holdouts**: Control groups excluded from all experiments for measuring overall experimentation program impact.

**Duration Estimation**: Predictive modeling for sample size calculation and experiment runtime based on confidence levels, minimum detectable effects, and historical conversion data.

The platform integrates seamlessly with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem, leveraging existing user data, cohorts, and behavioral insights for sophisticated experiment targeting and analysis.
