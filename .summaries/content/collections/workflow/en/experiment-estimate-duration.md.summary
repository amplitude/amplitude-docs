**Summary:** Documents Amplitude Experiment's duration estimator tool for calculating sample size and experiment run time needed to reach statistical significance, covering components like confidence level, control mean, standard deviation, power, test type, and minimum detectable effect (MDE) with their relationships to T-test sample size requirements.
