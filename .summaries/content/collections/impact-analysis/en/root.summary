# Impact Analysis in Amplitude

Impact Analysis is a powerful analytical feature in Amplitude that helps product teams understand how user engagement with one feature affects other behaviors in the product. This causal inference tool visualizes the relationship between a "treatment event" (a user action or feature interaction) and subsequent "outcome events" (resulting behaviors).

## Key Features and Concepts

### Core Functionality
- **Causal Inference Analysis**: Measures how triggering one event affects the frequency of other events
- **Before-After Comparison**: Compares user behavior before and after their first interaction with a feature
- **Relative n-day Basis**: Analyzes data relative to when each user first triggered the treatment event
- **Visual Representation**: Charts that display behavior changes over time

### Key Metrics
1. **Average**: The average number of times users performed the outcome event
2. **Active %**: The percentage of users who performed the outcome event at least once
3. **Frequency**: How often users performed the outcome event (among those who did it at least once)
4. **Properties**: The average value of a property associated with the outcome event

### Use Cases
- Determining if a new feature increases user engagement
- Measuring the impact of feature discovery on subsequent user behavior
- Understanding how one user action influences other actions in the product
- Guiding experimentation by identifying potential causal relationships

## Product Relationships and Architecture

Impact Analysis is available to customers on Amplitude's Growth and Enterprise plans. It complements other Amplitude analytics features by:

- Building on Event Segmentation data to provide deeper insights
- Serving as a precursor to more formal experimentation
- Providing visualization tools that help communicate product impact

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Treatment Event**: The initial user action or feature interaction being analyzed (the potential cause)
- **Outcome Event**: The subsequent user behavior being measured for impact (the potential effect)
- **Relative n-day Basis**: A time measurement approach that aligns all users' data based on when they first triggered the treatment event
- **User Counts**: The number of users included in the analysis, which is important for statistical significance
- **Alternate Hypotheses**: Other potential explanations for observed correlations

## Integration in the Amplitude Ecosystem

Impact Analysis fits into Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem as:

- A discovery tool that helps identify relationships worth testing more formally
- A complement to A/B testing and experimentation features
- A visualization tool for communicating product impact to stakeholders

## Best Practices for Interpretation

1. **Correlation ≠ Causation**: Impact Analysis shows correlations that suggest, but don't prove, causation
2. **Consider Alternate Hypotheses**: Other factors may explain observed correlations
3. **Use as a Guide for Experimentation**: Follow up insights with formal experiments
4. **Check User Counts**: Ensure sufficient data for statistical significance
5. **Compare Similar Time Periods**: For valid before-after comparisons

Impact Analysis serves as a bridge between basic analytics and formal experimentation, helping product teams discover potential causal relationships that warrant further investigation.
