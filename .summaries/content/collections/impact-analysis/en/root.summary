## Amplitude Impact Analysis

Impact Analysis is a specialized analytics feature within Amplitude that measures behavioral correlations by tracking how first-time engagement with treatment events affects the frequency of outcome events over time. This feature enables product teams to validate behavioral hypotheses and understand feature impact through causal inference methodologies.

## Product Relationships and Features

Impact Analysis operates as a dedicated chart type within Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem, specifically integrated with the Events Module and Segmentation Module. The feature is exclusively available on Growth and Enterprise plans, positioning it as an advanced analytics capability for organizations requiring sophisticated behavioral analysis.

The analysis framework centers on two core event types:
- **Treatment Events**: The initial user action or feature engagement being analyzed
- **Outcome Events**: The subsequent behaviors or actions being measured for correlation

Impact Analysis uses relative n-day timelines to track correlations, measuring how triggering one event influences the frequency of other events across specified time intervals.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Treatment Event**: The primary event or user action that serves as the trigger point for analysis, specifically focusing on first-time engagement instances.

**Outcome Event**: The target behavior or action being measured for correlation with the treatment event.

**Relative N-Day Timeline**: A time-based measurement framework that tracks behavioral changes relative to when the treatment event first occurred, using intervals like n-relative-day or n-relative-week periods.

**Lookback Periods**: Time constraints that vary based on selected intervals:
- Daily analysis: 90 calendar days
- Weekly analysis: 91 calendar days  
- Monthly analysis: 120 calendar days
- Quarterly analysis: 360 calendar days

**Four Core Metrics**:
- **Average Metric**: Mean number of event triggers per user
- **Active Percentage Metric**: Percentage of users who performed the outcome event
- **Frequency Distribution Metric**: Distribution patterns of event occurrence
- **Event Properties Metric**: Aggregated property values (average/sum) associated with events

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Impact Analysis functions as a specialized analytical tool within Amplitude's comprehensive product analytics platform. It complements traditional funnel analysis and cohort studies by providing causal inference capabilities that help distinguish correlation from causation in user behavior patterns.

The feature integrates with Amplitude's segmentation capabilities, allowing teams to analyze impact across different user cohorts and behavioral segments. This integration enables more granular analysis of how different user groups respond to treatment events.

Impact Analysis supports feature discovery impact assessment and user propensity analysis, making it valuable for product managers validating feature effectiveness and understanding long-term behavioral changes resulting from specific user actions.

## Analytical Methodology and Best Practices

The feature emphasizes causal inference validation through systematic hypothesis testing. Teams can evaluate alternate hypotheses and account for user count volatility considerations when interpreting results. The methodology encourages validation through randomized experimentation to confirm causal relationships identified through Impact Analysis.

The relative timeline approach allows teams to track both immediate and long-term behavioral changes, providing insights into how treatment events influence user engagement patterns over extended periods. This temporal analysis capability distinguishes Impact Analysis from snapshot-based analytics approaches.
