# Impact Analysis in Amplitude

Impact Analysis is a powerful analytical tool in Amplitude that helps product teams understand how user engagement with one feature affects other behaviors in the product. This causal inference tool visualizes the relationship between a "treatment event" (a user's first interaction with a feature) and subsequent "outcome events" (other user behaviors).

## Key Features and Concepts

### Core Functionality
- Measures how triggering one event for the first time affects the frequency of other events
- Compares user behavior before and after the treatment event
- Provides visualization of behavioral changes on a relative n-day basis
- Available on Amplitude's Growth and Enterprise plans

### Key Metrics
1. **Average**: Shows the average number of times users performed the outcome event per day
2. **Active %**: Displays the percentage of users who performed the outcome event at least once per day
3. **Frequency**: Indicates how many times active users performed the outcome event per day
4. **Properties**: Analyzes how user properties change after the treatment event

### Analysis Framework
- **Treatment Event**: The first-time interaction that serves as the intervention point
- **Outcome Event**: The behavior being measured for impact
- **Time Interval**: Analysis period before and after the treatment event (typically 7, 14, or 28 days)

## Relationship Between Components

The Impact Analysis tool connects feature adoption with broader user behavior patterns by:
1. Identifying users who performed a treatment event for the first time
2. Measuring their behavior before this event (baseline)
3. Comparing post-treatment behavior to the baseline
4. Visualizing the relative change in behavior

This creates a clear relationship between product features and user outcomes, helping teams understand which features drive desired behaviors.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Treatment Event**: The first-time interaction with a feature that serves as the intervention point
- **Outcome Event**: The behavior being measured for impact after the treatment
- **Relative n-day Basis**: The time-based framework for comparing pre- and post-treatment behavior
- **Causal Inference**: The process of determining whether one event causes another
- **Alternate Hypotheses**: Other potential explanations for observed behavior changes
- **User Counts**: The number of users included in each day of the analysis

## Integration in Amplitude's Ecosystem

Impact Analysis fits into Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem by:
- Complementing standard event tracking and cohort analysis
- Providing deeper insights than basic correlation analysis
- Supporting product experimentation decisions
- Helping teams prioritize feature development based on behavioral impact
- Serving as a preliminary step before formal A/B testing

## Best Practices for Interpretation

1. **Consider alternate hypotheses** for observed changes
2. **Check user counts** to ensure statistical significance
3. **Use as guidance for experimentation** rather than as a replacement
4. **Look for sustained changes** rather than temporary spikes
5. **Combine with other analysis tools** for comprehensive understanding
6. **Segment users** to identify different impact patterns across user groups

Impact Analysis serves as a bridge between basic analytics and formal experimentation, helping product teams develop hypotheses about feature impact that can be further validated through controlled experiments.
