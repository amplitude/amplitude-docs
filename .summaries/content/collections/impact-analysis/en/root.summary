## Amplitude Impact Analysis

Impact Analysis is a premium analytics feature in Amplitude that measures the causal relationship between user engagement with specific events and subsequent behavioral changes. This feature enables product teams to understand how first-time interactions with particular features or events influence user behavior patterns over time.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

Impact Analysis operates as a specialized chart type within Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem, specifically integrating with:

- **Events Module**: Sources treatment and outcome events from the core event tracking system
- **Segmentation Module**: Leverages user segmentation capabilities for refined analysis
- **Chart System**: Functions as a distinct chart type alongside other Amplitude visualization tools

The feature is positioned as a premium offering, available exclusively on Growth and Enterprise pricing tiers, indicating its role as an advanced analytics capability for larger organizations requiring sophisticated behavioral analysis.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Treatment Event**: The initial event or feature interaction being analyzed for its impact on user behavior. This represents the "cause" in the causal relationship being measured.

**Outcome Event**: The subsequent user behavior or event whose frequency is being measured for changes after treatment event exposure. This represents the "effect" being tracked.

**First-time Engagement**: The analysis specifically focuses on users' initial interaction with the treatment event, establishing a baseline for measuring behavioral changes.

**Relative n-day Timeline**: A time-aligned analysis framework that synchronizes user timelines based on when they first triggered the treatment event, enabling accurate before-and-after comparisons.

**Lookback Periods**: Time windows for analysis that vary based on selected intervals:
- Daily analysis: 90 calendar days
- Weekly analysis: 91 calendar days  
- Monthly analysis: 120 calendar days
- Quarterly analysis: 360 calendar days

## Analytics Metrics Framework

Impact Analysis provides four core measurement dimensions:

1. **Average**: Mean frequency of outcome events
2. **Active Percentage**: Proportion of users engaging with outcome events
3. **Frequency**: Rate of outcome event occurrence
4. **Properties**: Event property-based analysis for deeper behavioral insights

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Within Amplitude's analytics platform, Impact Analysis serves as a bridge between descriptive analytics and experimental validation. It provides an alternative to randomized experimentation when controlled testing isn't feasible, offering causal inference capabilities for behavioral hypothesis validation.

The feature complements Amplitude's core user journey analytics by enabling teams to:
- Validate feature impact hypotheses
- Understand user propensity changes following specific interactions
- Measure correlation versus causation in user behavior patterns
- Conduct retrospective analysis of feature launches or product changes

Impact Analysis represents Amplitude's advanced analytics tier, designed for organizations requiring sophisticated behavioral correlation analysis beyond standard event tracking and funnel analysis capabilities.
