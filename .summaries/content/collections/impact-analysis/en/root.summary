# Impact Analysis in Amplitude

Impact Analysis is a powerful analytical feature in Amplitude that helps product teams understand how user engagement with one feature affects other behaviors in the product. This causal inference tool visualizes the relationship between a "treatment event" (a user action or feature interaction) and subsequent "outcome events" (resulting behaviors).

## Key Features and Concepts

### Core Functionality
- Measures how first-time engagement with one feature affects the rate of other behaviors
- Compares user actions before and after triggering a specific "treatment event"
- Provides visual charts showing the impact of feature interactions on user behavior patterns
- Available on Amplitude's Growth and Enterprise plans

### Key Metrics
Impact Analysis provides four primary metrics for analysis:

1. **Average**: Shows the average number of times users performed the outcome event before and after the treatment event
2. **Active %**: Displays the percentage of users who performed the outcome event before and after the treatment event
3. **Frequency**: Indicates how often users who were already active performed the outcome event
4. **Properties**: Analyzes changes in event property values before and after the treatment event

### Analysis Framework
- Uses a "relative n-day basis" to normalize time periods before and after the treatment event
- Compares the same users' behavior before and after their first interaction with a feature
- Provides segmentation capabilities to analyze impacts across different user groups

## Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Treatment Event**: The specific user action or feature interaction being analyzed as the potential cause
- **Outcome Event**: The subsequent user behavior that might be affected by the treatment event
- **Relative n-day basis**: A time normalization approach that aligns users based on when they first triggered the treatment event
- **Causal Inference**: The analytical process of determining whether one event causes another
- **Alternate Hypotheses**: Other potential explanations for observed behavior changes beyond the treatment event

## Integration in Product Ecosystem

Impact Analysis serves as a bridge between basic analytics and formal experimentation in the product development workflow:

1. Helps identify potential causal relationships between features and user behaviors
2. Guides hypothesis formation for more rigorous A/B testing
3. Complements other Amplitude analytics tools by focusing specifically on causal relationships
4. Provides directional insights that inform experimentation strategy

## Best Practices for Interpretation

1. Consider alternate hypotheses for observed changes in behavior
2. Pay attention to user counts when interpreting results
3. Use Impact Analysis as guidance for experimentation rather than as a replacement
4. Be cautious about drawing definitive causal conclusions without additional testing
5. Consider the specific context and timing of the analysis when interpreting results

Impact Analysis charts are designed to help product teams discover relationships between features and behaviors, providing valuable insights that can guide product development decisions and experimentation strategies.
