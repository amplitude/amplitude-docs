**Summary:** Documents how to interpret Impact Analysis charts in Amplitude, which track how triggering a treatment event affects the frequency of outcome events using relative n-day timelines, covering four metrics (average, active percentage, frequency, properties) and causal inference best practices for validating behavioral hypotheses.
