**Summary:** Documents how to interpret Impact Analysis charts in Amplitude, which track how triggering one event affects the frequency of other events using relative n-day timelines, including four metrics (average, active percentage, frequency, properties) and causal inference best practices for validating behavioral hypotheses.
