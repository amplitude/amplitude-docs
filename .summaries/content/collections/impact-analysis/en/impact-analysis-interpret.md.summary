# Summary
This documentation explains how to interpret Impact Analysis charts in Amplitude, which visualize how triggering one event affects other event frequencies. It details four metrics (Average, Active %, Frequency, and Properties) for analysis and provides best practices for causal inference interpretation, emphasizing that this analysis should guide experimentation rather than replace it.
