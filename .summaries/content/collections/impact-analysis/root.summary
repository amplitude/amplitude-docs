## Amplitude Impact Analysis

Impact Analysis is a behavioral analytics feature within Amplitude that measures how first-time engagement with specific events (treatment events) influences the frequency of subsequent user behaviors (outcome events). This correlation analysis tool helps product teams understand the downstream effects of user actions and validate behavioral hypotheses through data-driven insights.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

Impact Analysis operates as a specialized chart type within Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem, specifically integrated with:

- **Events Module**: Sources treatment and outcome events from tracked user interactions
- **Segmentation Module**: Provides user segmentation capabilities for refined analysis
- **Growth and Enterprise Plans**: Exclusive availability tier with enhanced analytical capabilities

The feature bridges the gap between basic event tracking and advanced causal inference, offering a middle ground between simple correlation metrics and full randomized experimentation frameworks.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Treatment Event**: The initial user action or engagement being analyzed for its downstream impact on user behavior. Impact Analysis specifically tracks first-time engagement with these events.

**Outcome Event**: The subsequent user behavior or action that may be influenced by the treatment event. The analysis measures changes in frequency and patterns of these events.

**Relative N-Day Timeline**: The temporal framework used to measure impact, tracking how outcome event frequency changes over specified time periods following the treatment event.

**Lookback Periods**: Time-bound analysis windows that vary based on selected intervals:
- Daily analysis: 90 calendar days
- Weekly analysis: 91 calendar days  
- Monthly analysis: 120 calendar days
- Quarterly analysis: 360 calendar days

**Four Core Metrics**:
- **Average Metric**: Mean number of outcome event triggers per user
- **Active Percentage**: Proportion of users who perform the outcome event
- **Frequency Distribution**: Pattern analysis of how often users engage with outcome events
- **Event Properties**: Quantitative analysis (average/sum) of specific event attributes

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Impact Analysis serves as a bridge between descriptive analytics and predictive insights within Amplitude's product intelligence platform. It complements:

- **Basic event tracking** by adding causal inference capabilities
- **Segmentation analysis** by revealing behavioral correlations across user groups
- **Experimentation frameworks** by providing preliminary insights before implementing full A/B tests
- **Feature discovery processes** by quantifying the impact of new feature adoption on user engagement

The feature supports hypothesis-driven product development by enabling teams to validate assumptions about user behavior patterns and feature effectiveness through statistical correlation analysis, while maintaining awareness of the distinction between correlation and causation.

## Analysis and Validation Framework

Impact Analysis incorporates causal inference best practices, encouraging users to validate findings through multiple approaches including alternate hypothesis testing, user count volatility analysis, and comparison with randomized experimentation results. This methodology helps product teams make more informed decisions about feature development and user experience optimization based on behavioral data patterns.
