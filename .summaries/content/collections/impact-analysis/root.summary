# Impact Analysis in Amplitude

Impact Analysis is a powerful analytical feature in Amplitude that helps product teams understand how user engagement with one feature affects other behaviors in the product. This causal inference tool visualizes the relationship between a "treatment event" (a user action or feature interaction) and subsequent "outcome events" (resulting behaviors).

## Key Features and Concepts

### Core Functionality
- **Causal Inference Analysis**: Measures how triggering one event affects the frequency of other events
- **Before-After Comparison**: Compares user behavior before and after their first interaction with a feature
- **Relative n-day Basis**: Analyzes data relative to when each user first triggered the treatment event
- **Visual Representation**: Charts that display behavior changes over time

### Key Metrics
1. **Average**: The average number of times users performed the outcome event
2. **Active %**: The percentage of users who performed the outcome event at least once
3. **Frequency**: How often users performed the outcome event (among those who did it at least once)
4. **Properties**: Analysis of property values associated with the outcome event

## Use Cases
- Determining if a new feature increases user engagement
- Measuring the impact of feature discovery on subsequent user behavior
- Understanding how one user action influences other actions in the product
- Guiding experimentation by identifying potential causal relationships

## Product Relationships and Architecture

Impact Analysis is available to customers on Amplitude's Growth and Enterprise plans. It complements other Amplitude analytics features by:

- Building on Event Segmentation capabilities
- Providing deeper insights than basic correlation analysis
- Serving as a precursor to more formal experimentation

The feature fits into Amplitude's broader product ecosystem as an advanced analytics tool that bridges the gap between basic event tracking and formal A/B testing.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Treatment Event**: The initial user action or feature interaction being analyzed (the potential cause)
- **Outcome Event**: The subsequent user behavior being measured for impact (the potential effect)
- **First-time Engagement**: Analysis focuses specifically on users' first interaction with a feature
- **Relative n-day Basis**: Time measurement relative to when each user first triggered the treatment event
- **User Counts**: The number of users included in the analysis at each time point
- **Alternate Hypotheses**: Other potential explanations for observed behavior changes

## Best Practices for Interpretation

1. **Correlation vs. Causation**: Impact Analysis suggests relationships but doesn't prove causation
2. **Sample Size Awareness**: Consider user counts when interpreting results
3. **Complementary Analysis**: Use alongside other analytics tools and formal experimentation
4. **Time Window Consideration**: Analyze appropriate time periods before and after the treatment event
5. **Segmentation**: Apply relevant segmentation to isolate specific user groups

Impact Analysis should be used to guide experimentation rather than replace it, serving as a tool to generate hypotheses about causal relationships that can then be tested more rigorously.
