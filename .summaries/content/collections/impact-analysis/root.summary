# Impact Analysis in Amplitude

Impact Analysis is a powerful analytical feature in Amplitude that helps product teams understand how user engagement with one feature affects other behaviors in the product. This causal inference tool visualizes the relationship between a "treatment event" (a user action or feature interaction) and subsequent "outcome events" (resulting behaviors).

## Key Features and Concepts

### Core Functionality
- **Causal Inference Visualization**: Impact Analysis charts show how triggering one event affects the frequency of other events
- **Before-After Comparison**: Compares user behavior before and after their first interaction with a specific feature
- **Relative n-day Basis**: Analyzes behavior changes on a day-by-day basis relative to when users first triggered the treatment event
- **Feature Impact Discovery**: Helps teams understand how new features influence broader user behavior patterns

### Key Metrics
1. **Average**: The average number of times users performed the outcome event on each day
2. **Active %**: The percentage of users who performed the outcome event at least once on each day
3. **Frequency**: For active users, the average number of times they performed the outcome event on each day
4. **Properties**: Analyzes how property values change before and after the treatment event

## Relationship Between Features

Impact Analysis works in conjunction with other Amplitude features:
- **Segmentation**: Can be applied to specific user segments for more targeted analysis
- **Event Properties**: Allows analysis of how property values change after treatment events
- **Correlation Analysis**: Complements broader correlation analysis by focusing on specific causal relationships

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Treatment Event**: The specific user action or feature interaction being analyzed as the potential cause
- **Outcome Event**: The subsequent user behavior being measured for impact
- **First-time Engagement**: Analysis focuses on users' first interaction with a feature
- **Relative n-day Basis**: Time measurement relative to when each user first triggered the treatment event
- **Causal Inference**: Drawing conclusions about cause-effect relationships between events
- **Alternate Hypotheses**: Other potential explanations for observed behavior changes

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Impact Analysis serves as a bridge between basic analytics and experimental validation:
- Provides initial evidence of causal relationships that can guide formal experimentation
- Complements A/B testing by identifying potential relationships to test
- Helps prioritize product development by revealing which features drive desired outcomes
- Supports data-driven decision making about feature investment

## Availability and Access

- Available on Amplitude's Growth and Enterprise plans
- No specific API endpoints are mentioned in the documentation

## Best Practices for Interpretation

1. Consider alternate hypotheses for observed changes
2. Use as guidance for experimentation rather than as a replacement
3. Pay attention to user counts when interpreting results
4. Look for consistent patterns rather than isolated spikes
5. Consider the time interval appropriate for your specific product and user behavior
