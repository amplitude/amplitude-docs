## Amplitude Impact Analysis

Amplitude Impact Analysis is a specialized causal inference analytics feature that measures behavioral correlations by tracking how first-time engagement with treatment events affects the frequency of outcome events over time. This advanced analytics capability enables product teams to validate behavioral hypotheses, distinguish correlation from causation, and understand long-term feature impact through systematic behavioral analysis.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

Impact Analysis operates as a dedicated chart type within Amplitude's analytics ecosystem, specifically integrated with the Events Module and Segmentation Module. Positioned as a Growth and Enterprise plan exclusive feature, it represents Amplitude's advanced analytics tier for organizations requiring sophisticated behavioral analysis capabilities.

The feature functions as a complementary tool to traditional funnel analysis and cohort studies, extending Amplitude's analytical capabilities into causal inference territory. It integrates seamlessly with Amplitude's segmentation infrastructure, enabling granular analysis across different user cohorts and behavioral segments to understand how various user groups respond to treatment events.

Impact Analysis supports both feature discovery impact assessment and user propensity analysis, making it a critical tool for product managers validating feature effectiveness and measuring long-term behavioral changes resulting from specific user actions.

## Core Nomenclature and Definitions

**Treatment Events** serve as the primary trigger points for analysis, specifically focusing on first-time engagement instances that initiate the behavioral correlation measurement.

**Outcome Events** represent the target behaviors or actions being measured for correlation with treatment events, forming the dependent variable in the causal analysis framework.

**Relative N-Day Timeline** constitutes the temporal measurement framework that tracks behavioral changes relative to when the treatment event first occurred, using standardized intervals (n-relative-day, n-relative-week periods) to maintain consistent measurement baselines.

**Lookback Periods** define time constraints that vary based on selected analytical intervals:
- Daily analysis: 90 calendar days maximum
- Weekly analysis: 91 calendar days maximum  
- Monthly analysis: 120 calendar days maximum
- Quarterly analysis: 360 calendar days maximum

**Four Core Analytical Metrics** provide comprehensive behavioral measurement:
- **Average Metric**: Calculates mean number of event triggers per user
- **Active Percentage Metric**: Measures percentage of users who performed the outcome event
- **Frequency Distribution Metric**: Analyzes distribution patterns of event occurrence
- **Event Properties Metric**: Aggregates property values (average/sum) associated with events

## Broader Product Ecosystem Context

Impact Analysis extends Amplitude's product analytics platform into advanced causal inference territory, bridging the gap between descriptive analytics and predictive behavioral modeling. The feature positions Amplitude as a comprehensive solution for teams requiring both traditional product analytics and sophisticated behavioral correlation analysis.

Within Amplitude's broader ecosystem, Impact Analysis serves as the causal validation layer for insights generated through other analytical tools. Teams can use traditional Amplitude charts to identify behavioral patterns, then leverage Impact Analysis to validate whether observed correlations represent genuine causal relationships.

The feature's integration with Amplitude's segmentation capabilities enables multi-dimensional analysis, allowing teams to understand how treatment effects vary across user segments, geographic regions, device types, or custom behavioral cohorts.

## Analytical Methodology and Implementation

Impact Analysis employs a systematic causal inference methodology that emphasizes hypothesis validation through controlled behavioral observation. The feature encourages teams to formulate specific behavioral hypotheses, then use the relative timeline approach to track both immediate and long-term behavioral changes resulting from treatment events.

The methodology incorporates user count volatility considerations and alternate hypothesis evaluation, providing frameworks for interpreting results within broader behavioral contexts. Teams are encouraged to validate Impact Analysis findings through randomized experimentation to confirm causal relationships and eliminate confounding variables.

The relative timeline approach distinguishes Impact Analysis from snapshot-based analytics by enabling temporal behavioral tracking that reveals how treatment events influence user engagement patterns over extended periods. This longitudinal analysis capability provides insights into both immediate behavioral responses and sustained behavioral changes resulting from specific user actions.
