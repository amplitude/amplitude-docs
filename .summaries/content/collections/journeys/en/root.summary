# Amplitude Journeys: Comprehensive Path Analysis Tool

## Product Overview

Amplitude Journeys is a sophisticated path analysis tool that helps product teams understand how users navigate through their products and convert between key transitions. The product offers multiple visualization methods to analyze user behavior patterns, conversion rates, and drop-off points, enabling data-driven product optimization.

### Key Features

- **Multiple visualization types**: Pathfinder for flow diagrams and Journey Map for conversion patterns
- **Flexible analysis options**: Analyze by unique users or total event occurrences
- **Customizable conversion windows**: Define specific time periods for path analysis
- **Path expansion by property**: Drill down into paths based on event properties
- **Event filtering**: Include or exclude specific events from analysis
- **Cohort generation**: Create user cohorts based on specific paths
- **Conversion timing analysis**: Understand how long users take between steps

## Product Relationships and Architecture

Journeys in Amplitude consists of two primary visualization components that work together:

1. **Pathfinder Visualization**: A flow diagram showing how users navigate through a product, with nodes representing events and connections showing transitions between events. This visualization is ideal for high-level exploration of user paths.

2. **Journey Map Visualization**: A detailed view that reveals conversion patterns and timing between events, allowing for more precise comparison of different paths. This visualization excels at showing conversion rates and timing between specific steps.

Both visualizations share the same underlying data and configuration settings, allowing users to switch between views to gain different perspectives on the same user journey data. They complement each other by providing both broad overview (Pathfinder) and detailed comparison capabilities (Journey Map).

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Conversion Window**: The time period within which a user must complete a path to be counted in the analysis.
- **Bucket Threshold**: A setting that determines the minimum percentage of users required for a path to be displayed.
- **Path Expansion**: The ability to break down a path further based on event properties.
- **Unique vs. Total Counts**: Analysis can be based on either unique users (counting each user once) or total occurrences (counting every instance of an event).
- **Dropped-off Users**: Users who did not complete the full conversion path being analyzed.
- **Session Tracking**: Analysis of user paths within defined session boundaries.
- **Path Percentages**: The proportion of users who follow a specific path relative to the total.
- **Repeated Events**: Instances where the same event occurs multiple times in a user's journey.

## Integration with Amplitude Ecosystem

Journeys appears to be a core analytical tool within the broader Amplitude analytics platform. It integrates with Amplitude's user tracking and event collection systems to provide path analysis based on the events and properties defined in the platform.

The tool supports cohort generation, allowing users to create segments based on specific paths for further analysis in other Amplitude tools. This suggests Journeys works as part of an integrated analytics workflow where insights from path analysis can inform other types of analysis and targeting within the Amplitude ecosystem.

## Usage Examples

While specific API endpoints or command line invocations aren't explicitly mentioned in the documentation, the product appears to be primarily accessed through Amplitude's web interface. Users can:

- Switch between Pathfinder and Journey Map visualizations to analyze the same data from different perspectives
- Filter events to include or exclude from path analysis
- Expand paths based on event properties to gain deeper insights
- Adjust conversion windows to analyze user behavior over different time periods
- Toggle between unique user counts and total event occurrences
- Generate cohorts based on users who follow specific paths

The tool is designed to answer questions such as how users navigate through a product, where they drop off, which paths lead to the highest conversion rates, and how long users take between key steps in their journey.
