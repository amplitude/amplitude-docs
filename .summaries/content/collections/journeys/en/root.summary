## Amplitude Journeys: User Path Analysis and Conversion Tracking

Amplitude Journeys is a comprehensive user path analysis platform that combines legacy Journeys and Pathfinder Users charts to provide deep insights into user conversion paths and behavioral flows within digital products. The platform enables product teams to visualize, analyze, and optimize user journeys between key product transition points through advanced path exploration and detailed conversion analysis.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

Journeys operates through two primary visualization modes that work in tandem:

**Pathfinder Visualization** serves as the high-level exploration interface, providing broad path discovery capabilities for understanding overall user flow patterns. This visualization excels at identifying common user routes, drop-off points, and branching behaviors across the product experience.

**Journey Map** functions as the detailed analysis layer, offering granular path comparison capabilities with sophisticated filtering and segmentation options. This mode enables precise conversion window settings, detailed event filtering, and property-based path expansion for deep-dive analysis.

The platform integrates seamlessly with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem, allowing users to create cohorts directly from identified user paths and convert Pathfinder analyses into funnel charts for further conversion optimization.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Conversion Paths**: The sequence of events users take between defined starting and ending points in the product experience.

**Starting Event**: The initial touchpoint or action that begins the user journey analysis.

**Ending Event**: The target conversion point or final action in the analyzed user path.

**Between Events**: Intermediate actions that occur within the defined user journey, providing context for path progression.

**Conversion Window**: The time parameter that defines the allowable duration for users to complete the journey from start to end.

**Event Expansion by Property**: The capability to break down events by specific properties to understand how different user segments or contexts affect path progression.

**Path Segmentation**: The ability to filter and analyze specific user cohorts or behavioral patterns within the broader journey data.

**Uniques vs Totals Counting**: Measurement methodology distinguishing between unique users taking paths versus total instances of path completion.

**Session-based Analysis**: Path tracking that respects user session boundaries for more accurate behavioral understanding.

**Clock Time Analysis**: Time-based path analysis that considers real-world timing constraints and user behavior patterns.

## Ecosystem Integration and Migration

Journeys represents an evolution of Amplitude's path analysis capabilities, specifically migrating and enhancing functionality from legacy Journeys and Pathfinder Users charts. This consolidation provides users with a unified interface while maintaining backward compatibility and familiar analytical workflows.

The platform integrates with Amplitude's session tracking system to provide accurate user journey mapping and supports cohort creation workflows that feed into other Amplitude analysis tools. The conversion from Pathfinder visualizations to funnel analysis creates a seamless analytical pipeline for conversion optimization efforts.

## Analysis Capabilities and Methodologies

The platform supports both session-based and clock time analysis methodologies, allowing teams to choose the most appropriate measurement framework for their specific use cases. Event filtering and exclusion capabilities enable precise path definition, while repeated event handling ensures accurate representation of user behavior patterns.

Path percentage calculations provide quantitative insights into conversion rates and drop-off points, while drop-off analysis identifies specific friction points in the user experience. The platform's ability to handle event sequences with property-based expansion allows for sophisticated segmentation and behavioral analysis across different user contexts and product variations.
