# Amplitude Journeys: Comprehensive Path Analysis Tool

## Product Overview

Amplitude Journeys is a sophisticated path analysis tool that helps product teams understand how users navigate through their products. It visualizes user paths between key events, showing conversion patterns and user behavior flows. Journeys offers two primary visualization types—Pathfinder and Journey Map—each designed to answer different types of path analysis questions with varying levels of detail.

## Key Features and Capabilities

### Visualization Types

1. **Pathfinder Visualization**
   - Provides a high-level, exploratory view of user paths
   - Shows branching paths between events
   - Visualizes how users move through a product in a tree-like structure
   - Ideal for discovering unexpected user behaviors and path patterns

2. **Journey Map Visualization**
   - Offers detailed comparison of specific paths
   - Focuses on analyzing conversion between specific events
   - Provides more structured visualization for comparing defined paths
   - Better suited for analyzing known paths and conversion points

### Analysis Options

- **Measurement Types**:
  - **Uniques**: Counts unique users who took a specific path
  - **Totals**: Counts total occurrences of events in paths (including repeat actions)

- **Conversion Windows**: Customize the time period within which conversions must occur

- **Event Filtering**: Include or exclude specific events from path analysis

- **Path Expansion by Property**: Break down paths based on event properties to see how different segments behave

- **Bucket Threshold**: Control the minimum percentage of users required to display a path

- **Path Comparison**: Compare different user segments' paths through your product

- **Session Tracking**: Analyze paths within or across user sessions

- **Path-to-Funnel Conversion**: Convert discovered paths into funnel analyses

- **Event Collapse**: Simplify visualizations by combining similar events

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Path**: A sequence of events that users perform in a product
- **Conversion Window**: The timeframe within which a user must complete a path to be counted
- **Bucket Threshold**: Minimum percentage of users required for a path to be displayed
- **Dropped-off Users**: Users who did not continue to the next step in a path
- **Path Percentages**: The proportion of users who followed a specific path
- **Branching Paths**: Multiple possible paths users can take from a single event
- **Event Sequences**: The order in which events occur in a user's journey

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Journeys appears to be a core analytics feature within the Amplitude product suite. It complements other Amplitude analytics tools by providing path-specific insights:

- **Relationship to Funnels**: While funnels analyze conversion through a predefined sequence, Journeys shows all possible paths users take, including unexpected ones
- **Integration with Segmentation**: Allows analysis of paths for specific user segments
- **Conversion to Other Analyses**: Paths discovered in Journeys can be converted to funnel analyses for deeper conversion metrics

Journeys helps product teams answer questions about how users navigate their products, where users drop off, which paths lead to conversion, and how different user segments behave differently—making it a critical tool for product optimization and user experience improvement.

## Usage

The documentation doesn't specify exact API endpoints or command line invocations for Journeys, suggesting it's primarily accessed through Amplitude's web interface as an analytics visualization tool.
