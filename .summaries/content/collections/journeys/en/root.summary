# Amplitude Journeys: Comprehensive Path Analysis Tool

## Product Overview

Amplitude Journeys is an advanced analytics tool designed to visualize and analyze user paths through digital products. It helps product teams understand how users navigate between key events, identify conversion patterns, and optimize user flows. Journeys provides deep insights into user behavior by showing the sequences of actions users take, conversion rates between steps, and timing of conversions.

## Key Features and Visualizations

Journeys offers two primary visualization types:

1. **Pathfinder Visualization**
   - Flow diagram representation of user paths
   - Shows how users move between events in your product
   - Visualizes branches and multiple possible paths
   - Allows for path expansion by properties
   - Supports exploration of specific branches and segments
   - Enables filtering to focus on specific user behaviors

2. **Journey Map Visualization**
   - Detailed view of conversion patterns and timing
   - Compares different paths side-by-side
   - Shows conversion rates between steps
   - Provides timing information for conversions
   - Reveals patterns in user behavior across different segments

## Core Concepts and Terminology

- **Conversion Window**: The time period within which a user must complete a sequence of events to be counted in the analysis
- **Unique vs. Total Counts**: Analysis can be based on unique users (counting each user once) or total occurrences (counting every instance)
- **Bucket Threshold**: Minimum percentage of users required for a path to be displayed in the visualization
- **Path Expansion**: Breaking down paths by specific event properties to gain deeper insights
- **Dropped-off Users**: Users who did not complete the expected conversion path
- **Path Filtering**: Narrowing analysis to specific user segments or behaviors
- **Path Percentages**: The proportion of users who follow a specific path relative to the total

## Use Cases and Applications

Journeys is designed for:
- Analyzing conversion paths between key product transitions
- Identifying where users drop off in a process
- Comparing different user segments' behavior patterns
- Understanding the timing of conversions
- Optimizing user flows based on actual usage patterns
- Discovering unexpected user paths through a product

## Integration with Amplitude Ecosystem

Journeys complements other Amplitude analytics tools:
- Works alongside **Funnels** but provides more flexible path analysis beyond linear conversions
- Integrates with Amplitude's user segmentation capabilities
- Supports Amplitude's event property system for detailed breakdowns
- Can be used in conjunction with other Amplitude charts for comprehensive analysis

## Differences from Legacy Versions

The documentation notes that Journeys represents an evolution from legacy path analysis tools in Amplitude, offering:
- More intuitive visualizations
- Enhanced filtering capabilities
- Better support for property-based path expansion
- Improved performance for analyzing complex user journeys

## Technical Implementation

The Journeys tool is accessed through the Amplitude analytics interface. While specific API endpoints aren't mentioned in the provided documentation, users interact with the tool through the Amplitude UI to:
- Select events to analyze
- Configure visualization settings
- Apply filters and segments
- Adjust conversion windows
- Export or share findings

Journeys represents a sophisticated approach to understanding user behavior through visual path analysis, helping product teams make data-driven decisions about user experience optimization.
