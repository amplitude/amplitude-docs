## Amplitude Journeys

Amplitude Journeys is a comprehensive user path analysis platform that combines legacy Journeys and Pathfinder Users charts into a unified solution for tracking and analyzing user conversion paths between product transition points. The platform enables product teams to understand how users navigate through their applications by visualizing user flows, identifying conversion bottlenecks, and analyzing behavioral patterns across different user segments.

## Product Relationships and Features

Journeys represents a consolidation of Amplitude's path analysis capabilities, merging two previously separate tools:

**Legacy Integration**: The platform combines functionality from legacy Journeys and Pathfinder Users charts, providing backward compatibility while introducing enhanced analytical capabilities. This integration allows existing users to migrate their analysis workflows while gaining access to improved visualization and measurement options.

**Dual Visualization System**: Journeys offers two complementary visualization approaches:
- **Pathfinder Visualization**: Focuses on detailed path flow analysis with branching event sequences
- **Journey Map Visualization**: Provides comprehensive user journey mapping capabilities

Both visualizations share core functionality including event filtering, property expansion, conversion window configuration, and cohort creation capabilities.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Conversion Paths**: The sequence of events or actions users take as they move through product transition points, measured and analyzed to understand user behavior patterns.

**Transition Points**: Specific events or milestones in the user journey that serve as measurement nodes for path analysis.

**Conversion Window**: Configurable time periods that define the scope of analysis for measuring user paths and conversions.

**Event Filtering and Expansion**: Capabilities to refine analysis by filtering specific events and expanding analysis based on event properties.

**Uniques vs Totals Measurement**: Two measurement methodologies where uniques count distinct users performing actions, while totals count all instances of actions regardless of user duplication.

**Bucket Below Threshold**: A feature that groups less frequent paths or events below a specified threshold to simplify visualization and focus on significant user flows.

**Session-Based Analysis**: Analysis methodology that groups user actions within defined session boundaries.

**Event Property Grouping**: The ability to segment and analyze paths based on specific properties associated with events.

**Dropped Off Users**: Users who exit the analyzed flow at specific points without completing the intended conversion path.

**Any Event Property Filtering**: Advanced filtering capability that allows analysis based on any event property within the dataset.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Journeys integrates deeply with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem:

**Cohort Integration**: Users can create cohorts directly from Journeys analysis, enabling segmentation that can be applied across other Amplitude tools and external platforms.

**Funnel Conversion**: Pathfinder visualizations can be converted into funnel analyses, providing seamless transition between different analytical approaches within the Amplitude platform.

**Event Data Foundation**: Journeys leverages Amplitude's core event tracking infrastructure, utilizing session start/end events and comprehensive event property data.

**Legacy Migration Path**: The platform provides continuity for users transitioning from legacy Pathfinder and Journeys tools, with documented differences in conversion window handling and percentage calculations to ensure accurate migration of existing analyses.

## Technical Capabilities

**Visualization Engines**: The platform supports two distinct visualization approaches with shared underlying functionality for event processing and analysis.

**Property-Based Analysis**: Advanced event expansion capabilities allow analysis based on event properties, enabling detailed segmentation and filtering.

**Flexible Time Windows**: Configurable conversion windows accommodate different analysis needs, from short-term interaction analysis to long-term user journey tracking.

**Percentage Calculation Logic**: Enhanced calculation methods that differ from legacy implementations, providing more accurate representation of user path frequencies and conversion rates.

The platform represents Amplitude's evolution toward unified user journey analysis, combining the strengths of multiple legacy tools while introducing enhanced analytical capabilities for modern product analytics needs.
