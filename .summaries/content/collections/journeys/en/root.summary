# Amplitude Journeys: Path Analysis and User Journey Visualization

## Product Overview

Amplitude Journeys is a path analysis tool that enables product teams to visualize and analyze how users navigate through a product. The tool helps understand user behavior by showing the paths users take between key events, revealing conversion patterns, drop-off points, and user flow insights. Journeys offers multiple visualization types to examine user paths from different perspectives, supporting both high-level exploration and detailed comparative analysis.

## Key Features and Capabilities

### Visualization Types

1. **Pathfinder Visualization**
   - Provides a high-level, exploratory view of user paths
   - Shows branching paths between events
   - Visualizes how users move through a product in a tree-like structure
   - Allows for path expansion and exploration

2. **Journey Map Visualization**
   - Offers detailed comparison of specific paths
   - Enables side-by-side analysis of different user journeys
   - Provides more focused analysis than Pathfinder

### Analysis Options

- **Conversion Analysis**: Track how users convert between key product transitions
- **Path Expansion by Property**: Segment paths based on event properties
- **Event Filtering**: Include or exclude specific events from analysis
- **Conversion Windows**: Customize the time frame for analyzing user paths
- **Unique vs. Total Counts**: Analyze by unique users or total occurrences of events
- **Bucket Threshold**: Control the level of detail by setting minimum path percentage thresholds
- **Path Comparison**: Compare different user segments or time periods
- **Event Collapse**: Simplify visualization by combining similar events
- **Session Tracking**: Analyze paths within or across user sessions

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Path**: A sequence of events that users perform in a product
- **Conversion Window**: The time period within which user paths are analyzed
- **Bucket Threshold**: Minimum percentage required for a path to be displayed
- **Dropped-off Users**: Users who did not continue to the next step in a path
- **Path Percentages**: The proportion of users who followed a specific path
- **Path-to-funnel Conversion**: Converting a discovered path into a funnel for deeper analysis
- **Branching Paths**: Multiple possible paths users can take from a single event
- **Event Collapse**: Combining similar events to simplify visualization

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Journeys appears to be part of Amplitude's broader analytics platform, complementing other analysis tools:

- **Relationship to Funnels**: While funnels analyze conversion through a predefined sequence, Journeys reveals the actual paths users take, which may differ from expected paths
- **Evolution from Legacy Path Analysis**: Journeys represents an advancement over previous path analysis tools in Amplitude, offering more flexibility and visualization options

## Usage Context

Journeys is particularly valuable for:
- Discovering unexpected user behaviors
- Identifying popular paths through a product
- Finding drop-off points where users abandon journeys
- Comparing different user segments' navigation patterns
- Optimizing user flows based on actual usage patterns
- Converting discovered paths into funnels for further analysis

The tool helps product teams move beyond assumptions about how users navigate their products to understand actual user behavior, supporting data-driven product optimization.
