# Amplitude Journeys: Comprehensive Path Analysis Tool

## Product Overview

Amplitude Journeys is a sophisticated path analysis tool that helps product teams understand how users navigate through their products and convert between key transitions. The product offers multiple visualization methods to analyze user behavior patterns, conversion rates, and drop-off points, enabling data-driven product optimization.

### Key Features

- **Multiple visualization types**: Pathfinder for flow diagrams and Journey Map for detailed conversion analysis
- **Flexible path analysis**: Track user journeys across events, properties, and sessions
- **Conversion window customization**: Analyze paths within specific time frames
- **Segmentation capabilities**: Filter and compare paths by user properties
- **Measurement options**: View data by unique users or total occurrences
- **Path expansion**: Drill down into specific paths by properties
- **Cohort generation**: Create user segments based on specific paths

## Product Relationships and Architecture

Journeys in Amplitude consists of two primary visualization components that work together:

1. **Pathfinder Visualization**: A flow diagram showing how users navigate between events, with nodes representing events and connections showing transitions between them. This visualization is ideal for high-level exploration of user paths.

2. **Journey Map Visualization**: A detailed view that focuses on conversion patterns and timing between events, allowing for more precise comparison of different paths and their performance metrics.

Both visualizations share the same underlying data and configuration settings, allowing users to switch between views to gain different perspectives on the same user journey data. The visualizations complement each other by providing both broad overview (Pathfinder) and detailed analysis (Journey Map) of user paths.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Conversion Window**: The time frame within which a user must complete a path to be counted in the analysis.
- **Unique vs. Total Counts**: Measurement options where "unique" counts each user once regardless of how many times they complete a path, while "total" counts every occurrence.
- **Path Expansion**: The ability to break down a path segment by a specific property to see more detailed user flows.
- **Bucket Below Threshold**: A feature that groups less common paths together to simplify visualization.
- **Dropped-off Users**: Users who started but did not complete a defined conversion path.
- **Event Filtering**: The ability to include or exclude specific events from path analysis.
- **Session Tracking**: Following user paths within the context of individual usage sessions.
- **Path Percentages**: Metrics showing the proportion of users who follow specific paths.

## Integration with Amplitude Ecosystem

Journeys appears to be a core analytical component within the broader Amplitude analytics platform. It integrates with Amplitude's event tracking and user identification systems to provide path analysis capabilities. The tool allows for cohort generation, suggesting integration with Amplitude's segmentation and targeting features.

The ability to analyze paths by properties indicates integration with Amplitude's user property and event property tracking systems. The visualizations likely connect with other Amplitude features for further analysis and action on the insights discovered through path analysis.

## Usage Examples

While specific API endpoints or command line invocations aren't explicitly mentioned in the documentation, the product is used through Amplitude's web interface where users can:

- Configure path analysis by selecting start and end events
- Filter paths by specific user properties or behaviors
- Customize conversion windows to focus analysis on relevant timeframes
- Switch between visualization types to gain different perspectives
- Expand paths by properties to drill down into specific user segments
- Generate cohorts based on users who follow specific paths
- Compare different path segments to identify optimization opportunities

The Journeys tool enables product teams to answer questions about how users navigate through their products, where users drop off, which paths lead to the highest conversion rates, and how different user segments behave differently within the product.
