## Amplitude Journeys: User Path Analysis and Conversion Tracking

Amplitude Journeys is a comprehensive user path analysis platform that combines legacy Journeys and Pathfinder Users charts into a unified solution for tracking and analyzing user conversion paths between product transition points. The platform enables product teams to understand how users navigate through their applications, identify conversion bottlenecks, and optimize user experiences through detailed path visualization and analysis.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

Journeys operates through two primary visualization modes that work in tandem:

**Pathfinder Visualization** serves as the exploratory interface, providing a high-level view of user flow patterns and enabling broad path discovery. This visualization excels at identifying common user journeys and revealing unexpected navigation patterns across the product ecosystem.

**Journey Map Analysis** functions as the detailed analytical layer, offering granular insights into specific conversion paths with comprehensive filtering and segmentation capabilities. This mode allows for deep-dive analysis of particular user flows identified through Pathfinder exploration.

The platform integrates configurable conversion windows that determine the timeframe for path analysis, supporting both session-based and clock time analysis methodologies. Event filtering capabilities work across both visualization modes, enabling users to focus on specific actions or exclude irrelevant events from their analysis.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Starting Event**: The initial user action that begins a conversion path analysis, serving as the entry point for journey tracking.

**Ending Event**: The target action or conversion goal that defines successful path completion.

**Between Events**: Intermediate actions that occur within the conversion path, providing context for user behavior patterns.

**Conversion Window**: The configurable timeframe that defines how long users have to complete a path from starting to ending event.

**Event Expansion by Property**: The capability to break down events by specific properties, enabling more granular analysis of user actions and their contexts.

**Path Segmentation**: The ability to analyze different user cohorts or segments within the same journey visualization.

**Uniques vs Totals Counting**: Different methodologies for measuring user actions, where uniques count distinct users and totals count all instances of events.

**Drop-off Analysis**: The examination of points where users exit the conversion path before reaching the ending event.

## Ecosystem Integration and Broader Product Context

Journeys represents a consolidation effort within Amplitude's analytics ecosystem, migrating functionality from legacy Journeys and Pathfinder Users charts into a more robust, unified platform. This integration suggests Amplitude's strategic move toward comprehensive user journey analytics as a core product offering.

The platform connects with Amplitude's broader cohort management system, enabling users to create cohorts directly from identified user paths. This integration facilitates seamless transition from path analysis to targeted user engagement and experimentation.

Journeys also integrates with Amplitude's funnel analysis capabilities, allowing users to convert Pathfinder visualizations into traditional funnel charts for more structured conversion analysis. This cross-product functionality demonstrates the platform's role as a central hub in Amplitude's analytics ecosystem.

The session start/end event tracking capabilities indicate integration with Amplitude's session management infrastructure, providing context for user behavior within defined interaction periods. The platform's support for both session-based and clock time analysis suggests flexibility in accommodating different product types and analysis methodologies.

Through its event properties filtering and expansion capabilities, Journeys leverages Amplitude's underlying event tracking infrastructure, enabling detailed analysis of user actions with full context preservation. This deep integration ensures that path analysis maintains the granular detail necessary for actionable insights while providing the high-level visualization needed for strategic decision-making.
