## Amplitude Journeys: User Path Analysis and Conversion Tracking

Amplitude Journeys is a comprehensive user path analysis platform that combines legacy Journeys and Pathfinder Users charts into a unified solution for tracking and analyzing user conversion paths between product transition points. The platform enables product teams to understand how users navigate through their applications, identify conversion bottlenecks, and optimize user experiences through detailed path visualization and analysis.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

Journeys operates through two primary visualization modes that work in tandem:

**Pathfinder Visualization** serves as the high-level exploration tool, providing broad path discovery capabilities for understanding overall user flow patterns. This visualization excels at identifying the most common paths users take and revealing unexpected navigation patterns.

**Journey Map Visualization** functions as the detailed analysis companion, offering granular path comparison capabilities with advanced filtering and segmentation options. This mode enables deep-dive analysis of specific conversion scenarios and detailed path performance metrics.

Both visualizations share core analytical infrastructure including event filtering systems, property expansion capabilities, conversion window management, and cohort creation functionality, ensuring consistent data interpretation across different analysis approaches.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Conversion Paths**: The sequence of events users complete when moving between defined product transition points, representing the actual user journey through the application.

**Starting Event**: The initial trigger point that begins a user journey analysis, defining where path tracking commences.

**Ending Event**: The target completion point for path analysis, representing successful conversion or journey completion.

**Between Events**: Intermediate actions that occur within the conversion path, providing context for user behavior patterns between start and end points.

**Conversion Window**: The time-based parameter that defines the maximum duration allowed for completing a conversion path, with distinct handling logic compared to legacy implementations.

**Event Expansion by Property**: The capability to break down events by specific properties, enabling segmented analysis of user paths based on contextual attributes.

**Path Segmentation**: The process of dividing user journeys into distinct groups based on behavioral patterns, user characteristics, or event properties.

**Uniques vs Totals Counting**: The measurement methodology distinction between counting unique users versus total event occurrences in path analysis.

## Ecosystem Integration and Positioning

Journeys represents a consolidation effort within Amplitude's analytics ecosystem, specifically migrating functionality from legacy Journeys and Pathfinder Users charts into a modernized, unified platform. This integration maintains backward compatibility while introducing enhanced analytical capabilities.

The platform integrates with Amplitude's broader cohort management system, enabling users to create targeted user segments directly from path analysis results. Additionally, Journeys connects with funnel analysis capabilities, allowing conversion from Pathfinder visualizations into detailed funnel analysis workflows.

Session-based analysis capabilities integrate with Amplitude's event tracking infrastructure, supporting both session-based and clock time analysis methodologies. The platform handles session start/end events automatically while providing flexibility for custom event sequence analysis.

## Technical Capabilities and Analysis Options

Journeys supports multiple analytical approaches including session-based analysis for understanding user behavior within defined session boundaries, and clock time analysis for tracking user actions across extended time periods. The platform provides sophisticated event filtering capabilities through the "Any Event" property filtering system, enabling precise path analysis based on specific user actions or characteristics.

The conversion window logic has been redesigned from legacy implementations, offering more accurate percentage calculations and improved handling of dropped-off users. Path percentage calculations now provide clearer insights into conversion rates and user drop-off points throughout the journey.

Event sequence branching capabilities allow analysts to understand decision points within user paths, identifying where users diverge from expected conversion flows and revealing optimization opportunities for product teams.
