# Amplitude Journeys: Path Analysis and User Journey Visualization

## Product Overview

Amplitude Journeys is a sophisticated path analysis tool designed for product teams to visualize and analyze user navigation patterns. The tool reveals how users move through a product by tracking paths between key events, uncovering conversion patterns, identifying drop-off points, and providing comprehensive user flow insights. Journeys helps teams understand actual user behavior rather than relying on assumptions about how users interact with their products.

The primary use cases for Amplitude Journeys include:
- Discovering unexpected user behaviors and navigation patterns
- Identifying the most popular paths through a product
- Pinpointing critical drop-off points where users abandon their journeys
- Comparing navigation patterns across different user segments
- Optimizing user flows based on actual usage data
- Converting discovered paths into funnels for deeper analysis

## Product Architecture and Relationships

Amplitude Journeys offers two complementary visualization types that serve different analytical purposes:

1. **Pathfinder Visualization**: Provides a high-level, exploratory view of user paths in a tree-like structure, showing how users branch between different events. This visualization is ideal for initial discovery and understanding the overall navigation landscape.

2. **Journey Map Visualization**: Offers a more focused, detailed comparison of specific paths, enabling side-by-side analysis of different user journeys. This visualization is better suited for comparative analysis once key paths have been identified.

Journeys appears to be part of Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem, complementing other analysis tools like Funnels. While Funnels analyzes conversion through predefined sequences, Journeys reveals the actual paths users take, which may differ significantly from expected paths. Journeys represents an evolution from Amplitude's legacy path analysis tools, offering enhanced flexibility and visualization options.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Path**: A sequence of events that users perform while navigating through a product
- **Conversion Window**: The specified time period within which user paths are analyzed
- **Bucket Threshold**: The minimum percentage required for a path to be displayed in the visualization
- **Dropped-off Users**: Users who did not continue to the next step in a particular path
- **Path Percentages**: The proportion of users who followed a specific path through the product
- **Path-to-funnel Conversion**: The process of converting a discovered path into a funnel for more detailed analysis
- **Branching Paths**: Multiple possible paths users can take from a single event point
- **Event Collapse**: A feature that combines similar events to simplify visualization and analysis

## Analysis Capabilities

Amplitude Journeys offers a robust set of analytical features:

- **Conversion Analysis**: Track how users convert between key product transitions
- **Path Expansion by Property**: Segment paths based on specific event properties
- **Event Filtering**: Include or exclude specific events from the analysis
- **Conversion Windows**: Customize the time frame for analyzing user paths
- **Unique vs. Total Counts**: Analyze by unique users or total occurrences of events
- **Bucket Threshold Adjustment**: Control the level of detail by setting minimum path percentage thresholds
- **Path Comparison**: Compare different user segments or time periods
- **Event Collapse**: Simplify visualization by combining similar events
- **Session Tracking**: Analyze paths within or across user sessions

These capabilities enable product teams to move beyond assumptions about user behavior and make data-driven decisions for product optimization based on actual usage patterns.
