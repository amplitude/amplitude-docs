Amplitude Journeys is a unified user path analysis platform that consolidates Amplitude's journey analytics capabilities into a comprehensive solution for tracking and analyzing user conversion paths between product transition points. The platform enables product teams to visualize user flows, identify conversion bottlenecks, and analyze behavioral patterns across different user segments through advanced path analysis and journey mapping.

## Product Architecture and Feature Integration

Journeys represents a strategic consolidation of Amplitude's path analysis tools, merging legacy Journeys and Pathfinder Users charts into a single, enhanced platform. This integration maintains backward compatibility while introducing improved analytical capabilities, allowing existing users to migrate workflows seamlessly while accessing enhanced visualization and measurement options.

The platform operates through a dual visualization system that provides complementary analytical approaches:

**Pathfinder Visualization** focuses on detailed path flow analysis with branching event sequences, enabling granular examination of user navigation patterns and decision points within applications.

**Journey Map Visualization** delivers comprehensive user journey mapping capabilities, providing broader context for understanding complete user experiences across extended interaction periods.

Both visualization engines share core analytical infrastructure, including event filtering mechanisms, property expansion capabilities, conversion window configuration, and integrated cohort creation functionality.

## Core Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Conversion Paths** represent the sequential events or actions users execute while navigating through product transition points, serving as the fundamental data structure for behavioral pattern analysis.

**Transition Points** function as specific events or milestones within user journeys that serve as measurement nodes for path analysis, enabling teams to identify critical decision moments and conversion opportunities.

**Conversion Windows** provide configurable time boundaries that define analytical scope for measuring user paths and conversions, accommodating both short-term interaction analysis and long-term behavioral tracking.

**Event Filtering and Expansion** encompasses advanced capabilities for refining analysis through specific event filtering and expanding analysis scope based on event properties, enabling precise segmentation and focused insights.

**Uniques vs Totals Measurement** represents two distinct measurement methodologies where uniques count distinct users performing actions, while totals aggregate all action instances regardless of user duplication, providing different perspectives on user engagement intensity.

**Bucket Below Threshold** functions as a visualization optimization feature that groups less frequent paths or events below specified thresholds, simplifying complex visualizations while maintaining focus on statistically significant user flows.

**Session-Based Analysis** provides analytical methodology that groups user actions within defined session boundaries, enabling understanding of user behavior within discrete interaction periods.

**Event Property Grouping** enables segmentation and analysis of paths based on specific properties associated with events, allowing for detailed behavioral analysis across different user characteristics or interaction contexts.

**Dropped Off Users** identifies users who exit analyzed flows at specific points without completing intended conversion paths, providing insights into friction points and optimization opportunities.

**Any Event Property Filtering** delivers advanced filtering capabilities that enable analysis based on any event property within datasets, providing flexible analytical approaches for complex user behavior investigation.

## Ecosystem Integration and Platform Connectivity

Journeys integrates comprehensively with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem through multiple connection points:

**Cohort Integration** enables direct cohort creation from Journeys analysis results, facilitating user segmentation that extends across other Amplitude tools and external platforms for comprehensive user lifecycle management.

**Funnel Conversion** provides seamless transformation of Pathfinder visualizations into funnel analyses, enabling fluid transition between different analytical methodologies within the Amplitude platform ecosystem.

**Event Data Foundation** leverages Amplitude's core event tracking infrastructure, utilizing session start/end events and comprehensive event property data to provide robust analytical foundations.

**Legacy Migration Framework** ensures continuity for users transitioning from legacy Pathfinder and Journeys tools, with documented differences in conversion window handling and percentage calculations to maintain analytical accuracy during platform migration.

## Technical Implementation and Analytical Capabilities

The platform implements sophisticated visualization engines that support dual analytical approaches while maintaining shared underlying functionality for event processing and analysis. Property-based analysis capabilities enable advanced event expansion based on event properties, facilitating detailed segmentation and filtering for complex behavioral investigation.

Flexible time window configuration accommodates diverse analysis requirements, from short-term interaction analysis to extended user journey tracking across multiple sessions and time periods. Enhanced percentage calculation logic differs from legacy implementations, providing more accurate representation of user path frequencies and conversion rates through improved statistical methodologies.

Journeys represents Amplitude's evolution toward unified user journey analysis, combining strengths from multiple legacy analytical tools while introducing enhanced capabilities designed for modern product analytics requirements. The platform enables comprehensive understanding of user behavior patterns through sophisticated path analysis, supporting data-driven product optimization and user experience enhancement strategies.
