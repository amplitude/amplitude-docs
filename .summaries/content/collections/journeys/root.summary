# Amplitude Journeys: Comprehensive Path Analysis Tool

## Product Overview

Amplitude Journeys is a sophisticated path analysis tool that helps product teams understand how users navigate through their products and convert between key transitions. It provides multiple visualization methods to analyze user behavior patterns, conversion rates, and drop-off points, enabling data-driven product optimization.

Journeys allows teams to track user navigation across events, properties, and sessions, identify the most common paths users take, pinpoint where users drop off, and understand conversion patterns between key events. This enables product teams to optimize user flows, improve conversion rates, and enhance the overall user experience.

## Product Relationships and Features

Journeys consists of two primary visualization components:

1. **Pathfinder Visualization**: A flow diagram showing how users navigate between events, with nodes representing events and connections showing transitions between them. Ideal for high-level exploration of user paths and identifying common navigation patterns.

2. **Journey Map Visualization**: A detailed view focusing on conversion patterns and timing between events, allowing for more precise comparison of different paths and their performance metrics. This visualization helps analyze conversion rates and drop-off points more thoroughly.

Both visualizations share the same underlying data and configuration settings, allowing users to switch between views to gain different perspectives on the same user journey data. The visualizations complement each other by providing both broad overview (Pathfinder) and detailed analysis (Journey Map).

Additional features include:
- Conversion window customization to analyze paths within specific time frames
- Segmentation capabilities to filter and compare paths by user properties
- Multiple measurement options (unique users or total occurrences)
- Path expansion to drill down into specific paths by properties
- Cohort generation based on specific paths

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Conversion Window**: The time frame within which a user must complete a path to be counted in the analysis.
- **Unique vs. Total Counts**: Measurement options where "unique" counts each user once regardless of how many times they complete a path, while "total" counts every occurrence.
- **Path Expansion**: The ability to break down a path segment by a specific property to see more detailed user flows.
- **Bucket Below Threshold**: A feature that groups less common paths together to simplify visualization.
- **Dropped-off Users**: Users who started but did not complete a defined conversion path.
- **Event Filtering**: The ability to include or exclude specific events from path analysis.
- **Session Tracking**: Following user paths within the context of individual usage sessions.
- **Path Percentages**: Metrics showing the proportion of users who follow specific paths.

## Integration with Amplitude Ecosystem

Journeys is a core analytical component within the broader Amplitude analytics platform. It integrates with:

- Amplitude's event tracking and user identification systems
- Amplitude's segmentation and targeting features through cohort generation
- User property and event property tracking systems for detailed path analysis

The insights discovered through Journeys can be used to inform other Amplitude features and drive product decisions based on actual user behavior data.

## Usage Workflow

Journeys is accessed through Amplitude's web interface where users can:

1. Configure path analysis by selecting start and end events
2. Filter paths by specific user properties or behaviors
3. Customize conversion windows to focus analysis on relevant timeframes
4. Switch between visualization types to gain different perspectives
5. Expand paths by properties to drill down into specific user segments
6. Generate cohorts based on users who follow specific paths
7. Compare different path segments to identify optimization opportunities

The tool enables product teams to answer critical questions about user navigation patterns, drop-off points, conversion rates, and behavioral differences between user segments, ultimately leading to more informed product decisions.
