# Amplitude Journeys: Comprehensive Path Analysis Tool

## Product Overview

Amplitude Journeys is an advanced analytics tool that visualizes and analyzes user paths through digital products. It helps product teams understand navigation patterns between key events, identify conversion patterns, and optimize user flows. The tool provides insights into user behavior sequences, conversion rates between steps, and timing of conversions.

## Key Features and Visualizations

Journeys offers two primary visualization types:

1. **Pathfinder Visualization**
   - Flow diagram representation of user paths
   - Shows user movement between product events
   - Visualizes branches and multiple possible paths
   - Allows path expansion by properties
   - Supports exploration of specific branches and segments
   - Enables filtering for focused behavior analysis

2. **Journey Map Visualization**
   - Detailed view of conversion patterns and timing
   - Compares different paths side-by-side
   - Shows conversion rates between steps
   - Provides timing information for conversions
   - Reveals patterns across different user segments

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Conversion Window**: Time period within which users must complete event sequences to be counted
- **Unique vs. Total Counts**: Analysis based on unique users (counted once) or total occurrences (every instance)
- **Bucket Threshold**: Minimum percentage of users required for a path to appear in visualizations
- **Path Expansion**: Breaking down paths by specific event properties for deeper insights
- **Dropped-off Users**: Users who didn't complete the expected conversion path
- **Path Filtering**: Narrowing analysis to specific user segments or behaviors
- **Path Percentages**: Proportion of users following a specific path relative to the total

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Journeys complements other Amplitude analytics tools:
- Works alongside **Funnels** but provides more flexible path analysis beyond linear conversions
- Integrates with Amplitude's user segmentation capabilities
- Supports Amplitude's event property system for detailed breakdowns
- Can be used with other Amplitude charts for comprehensive analysis

Journeys represents an evolution from legacy path analysis tools in Amplitude, offering more intuitive visualizations, enhanced filtering capabilities, better support for property-based path expansion, and improved performance for analyzing complex user journeys.

## Implementation and Access

The Journeys tool is accessed through the Amplitude analytics interface. Users interact with the tool through the Amplitude UI to:
- Select events to analyze
- Configure visualization settings
- Apply filters and segments
- Adjust conversion windows
- Export or share findings

Journeys enables product teams to make data-driven decisions about user experience optimization through sophisticated visual path analysis.
