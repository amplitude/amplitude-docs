# Amplitude Journeys: Path Analysis Tool

## Overview

Amplitude Journeys is a path analysis tool that helps product teams understand user navigation patterns and conversion behaviors. It visualizes how users move through products, identifies drop-off points, and measures conversion rates between key transitions. The tool supports data-driven product optimization by revealing user behavior patterns across different segments and timeframes.

## Key Features and Capabilities

- **Dual visualization methods**: 
  - Pathfinder: Flow diagram showing navigation patterns
  - Journey Map: Detailed conversion pattern analysis
- **Analysis flexibility**: Analyze by unique users or total event occurrences
- **Customizable conversion windows**: Define specific timeframes for path completion
- **Path expansion by properties**: Drill down into paths based on event properties
- **Event filtering**: Include or exclude specific events from analysis
- **Cohort generation**: Create user segments based on specific paths
- **Conversion timing analysis**: Measure time between steps in user journeys

## Product Relationships

Journeys consists of two complementary visualization components:

1. **Pathfinder Visualization**: Provides a flow diagram showing how users navigate through a product. Nodes represent events and connections show transitions between events. This visualization excels at high-level exploration of user paths.

2. **Journey Map Visualization**: Offers a detailed view of conversion patterns and timing between events, enabling precise comparison of different paths. This visualization specializes in showing conversion rates and timing between specific steps.

Both visualizations share the same underlying data and configuration settings, allowing users to switch between views for different analytical perspectives on the same journey data.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Conversion Window**: Time period within which a user must complete a path to be counted
- **Bucket Threshold**: Minimum percentage of users required for a path to be displayed
- **Path Expansion**: Breaking down a path further based on event properties
- **Unique vs. Total Counts**: Analysis based on either unique users or total event occurrences
- **Dropped-off Users**: Users who did not complete the full conversion path
- **Session Tracking**: Analysis of user paths within defined session boundaries
- **Path Percentages**: Proportion of users following a specific path relative to the total
- **Repeated Events**: Instances where the same event occurs multiple times in a user journey

## Integration with Amplitude Ecosystem

Journeys functions as a core analytical tool within the broader Amplitude analytics platform. It integrates with Amplitude's event collection and user tracking systems to analyze paths based on the events and properties defined in the platform.

The tool supports cohort generation, allowing analysts to create user segments based on specific paths for further analysis in other Amplitude tools. This enables an integrated analytics workflow where path analysis insights can inform other types of analysis and targeting within the Amplitude ecosystem.

Journeys appears designed to complement other Amplitude features by providing specialized path analysis capabilities that work with the same underlying event and user data used throughout the platform.

## Usage Patterns

Journeys is primarily accessed through Amplitude's web interface. Common usage patterns include:

- Switching between Pathfinder and Journey Map visualizations for different analytical perspectives
- Filtering events to focus analysis on specific user behaviors
- Expanding paths based on event properties for deeper insights
- Adjusting conversion windows to analyze behavior over different timeframes
- Toggling between unique user counts and total event occurrences
- Generating cohorts based on users who follow specific paths

The tool helps answer questions about user navigation patterns, drop-off points, conversion rates, and time-to-conversion between key steps in the user journey.
