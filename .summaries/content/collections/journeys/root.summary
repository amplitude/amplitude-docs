## Amplitude Journeys: Unified User Path Analysis Platform

Amplitude Journeys is a comprehensive user path analysis and conversion tracking platform that consolidates legacy Journeys and Pathfinder Users charts into a unified solution. The platform enables product teams to visualize, analyze, and optimize user navigation patterns through applications by tracking conversion paths between product transition points, identifying bottlenecks, and understanding user behavior across different journey stages.

## Product Architecture and Feature Integration

The platform operates through two complementary visualization modes that share core analytical infrastructure:

**Pathfinder Visualization** functions as the primary exploration tool for broad path discovery, revealing common user flow patterns and unexpected navigation behaviors across the application. This mode excels at high-level journey mapping and pattern identification.

**Journey Map Visualization** serves as the detailed analysis engine, providing granular path comparison capabilities with advanced filtering, segmentation, and performance metrics. This mode enables deep-dive analysis of specific conversion scenarios and comparative path performance evaluation.

Both visualization modes leverage shared analytical components including event filtering systems, property expansion capabilities, conversion window management, and cohort creation functionality, ensuring data consistency and seamless transitions between analysis approaches.

## Core Nomenclature and Definitions

**Conversion Paths**: Sequential event chains representing user movement between defined product transition points, capturing the complete user journey through application workflows.

**Starting Event**: Initial trigger point that commences journey analysis, establishing the baseline for path tracking and conversion measurement.

**Ending Event**: Target completion point representing successful conversion or journey fulfillment, serving as the conversion goal for path analysis.

**Between Events**: Intermediate actions occurring within conversion paths that provide behavioral context and reveal user decision patterns between start and end points.

**Conversion Window**: Time-based parameter defining maximum duration for path completion, featuring redesigned logic that improves percentage calculations and dropped-user handling compared to legacy implementations.

**Event Expansion by Property**: Analytical capability enabling event breakdown by specific properties, facilitating segmented path analysis based on contextual attributes and user characteristics.

**Path Segmentation**: Process of categorizing user journeys into distinct behavioral groups based on patterns, user attributes, or event properties for targeted analysis.

**Uniques vs Totals Counting**: Measurement methodology distinguishing between unique user counts and total event occurrence counts in path analysis calculations.

## Ecosystem Integration and Platform Positioning

Journeys represents a strategic consolidation within Amplitude's analytics ecosystem, migrating and modernizing functionality from legacy systems while maintaining backward compatibility. The platform integrates deeply with Amplitude's cohort management infrastructure, enabling direct creation of targeted user segments from path analysis results.

The system connects with funnel analysis capabilities, supporting conversion from Pathfinder visualizations into detailed funnel workflows for deeper conversion analysis. Integration with Amplitude's event tracking infrastructure supports both session-based and clock time analysis methodologies, with automatic handling of session start/end events while maintaining flexibility for custom event sequences.

## Technical Capabilities and Analysis Framework

The platform supports multiple analytical methodologies including session-based analysis for understanding behavior within defined session boundaries, and clock time analysis for tracking extended-period user actions. Advanced event filtering through the "Any Event" property system enables precise path analysis based on specific user actions and characteristics.

Redesigned conversion window logic provides enhanced accuracy in percentage calculations and improved handling of user drop-off scenarios. Path percentage calculations deliver clearer insights into conversion rates and identification of critical drop-off points throughout user journeys.

Event sequence branching capabilities enable analysis of decision points within user paths, revealing where users diverge from expected conversion flows and identifying optimization opportunities. The platform handles complex path variations while maintaining analytical precision across different user journey scenarios.
