## Amplitude Journeys: User Path Analysis and Conversion Tracking

Amplitude Journeys is a comprehensive user path analysis tool that enables product teams to visualize and understand how users navigate through their applications. The product combines legacy Journeys and Pathfinder Users functionality into a unified charting system that tracks user conversion paths between key product transition points, providing insights into user behavior patterns, drop-off points, and conversion optimization opportunities.

## Core Features and Visualization Modes

Journeys operates through two primary visualization modes, each serving distinct analytical purposes:

**Pathfinder Visualization** functions as a high-level exploration tool for broad user journey analysis, enabling teams to identify overall flow patterns and major conversion paths through their product ecosystem.

**Journey Map Visualization** provides detailed path comparison capabilities, allowing for granular analysis of specific user routes and conversion sequences with enhanced filtering and segmentation options.

Both visualization modes support flexible counting methodologies, offering analysis based on either unique user counts or total event counts, accommodating different analytical needs and use cases.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Conversion Paths** represent the sequential flow of user actions between defined start and end points, capturing the actual routes users take through product experiences rather than idealized funnel flows.

**Conversion Windows** define the time boundaries within which user actions are considered part of a cohesive journey, supporting both session-based windows (tied to Amplitude's session tracking) and clock-time windows for more flexible temporal analysis.

**Event Expansion** allows analysts to break down events by specific properties, enabling deeper segmentation of user paths based on contextual attributes like feature variations, user segments, or interaction types.

**Path Branching** visualizes the divergent routes users take from common starting points, highlighting where user journeys split and the relative popularity of different continuation paths.

**Drop-off Analysis** identifies points in user journeys where significant user attrition occurs, providing insights into potential friction points or optimization opportunities.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Journeys integrates deeply with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem, leveraging the platform's event tracking infrastructure and session management capabilities. The tool connects with Amplitude's cohort creation functionality, enabling users to generate audience segments directly from identified user paths for targeted analysis or activation campaigns.

The product supports seamless conversion to funnel analysis, allowing teams to transition from exploratory path analysis to structured conversion measurement. This integration bridges the gap between open-ended user journey exploration and hypothesis-driven conversion optimization.

Journeys also incorporates Amplitude's event filtering and property-based segmentation capabilities, enabling analysts to focus on specific user behaviors, exclude irrelevant actions, and analyze paths within defined user segments or feature contexts.

## Advanced Analytical Capabilities

The platform handles complex user journey scenarios including repeated event handling, where users may perform the same action multiple times within a conversion window, and path progression timing analysis that reveals the temporal patterns of user navigation.

Event filtering and exclusion capabilities allow analysts to remove noise from user paths, focusing on meaningful interactions while maintaining the integrity of the overall journey flow. Property-based expansion enables detailed breakdowns of user paths based on contextual attributes, supporting sophisticated segmentation and comparative analysis.

The system calculates path percentage distributions, providing quantitative insights into the relative popularity of different user routes and enabling data-driven prioritization of optimization efforts. Session start and end event tracking ensures accurate journey boundary definition, particularly important for products with complex multi-session user experiences.
