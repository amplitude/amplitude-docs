## Amplitude Journeys: User Path Analysis and Conversion Tracking Platform

Amplitude Journeys is a comprehensive user path analysis platform that consolidates legacy Journeys and Pathfinder Users charts into a unified interface for visualizing, analyzing, and optimizing user conversion paths and behavioral flows within digital products. The platform enables product teams to understand user journey progression between key transition points through advanced path exploration, detailed conversion analysis, and sophisticated segmentation capabilities.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

Journeys operates through two complementary visualization modes that provide different analytical perspectives:

**Pathfinder Visualization** functions as the primary exploration interface, offering broad path discovery capabilities for understanding overall user flow patterns. This mode excels at identifying common user routes, behavioral branching points, and drop-off locations across the product experience, providing teams with high-level journey insights.

**Journey Map** serves as the detailed analysis layer, delivering granular path comparison capabilities with advanced filtering and segmentation options. This mode enables precise conversion window configuration, comprehensive event filtering, and property-based path expansion for deep-dive behavioral analysis.

The platform integrates seamlessly with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem, supporting direct cohort creation from identified user paths and enabling conversion of Pathfinder analyses into funnel charts for enhanced conversion optimization workflows.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Conversion Paths**: Sequential event flows that users follow between defined starting and ending points within the product experience.

**Starting Event**: The initial user touchpoint or action that triggers the beginning of journey analysis tracking.

**Ending Event**: The target conversion point or final action that defines successful journey completion.

**Between Events**: Intermediate actions occurring within the defined user journey that provide contextual understanding of path progression and user behavior.

**Conversion Window**: Time-based parameters that establish the allowable duration for users to complete the journey from starting event to ending event.

**Event Expansion by Property**: Advanced capability to decompose events by specific properties, enabling analysis of how different user segments, contexts, or product variations affect path progression.

**Path Segmentation**: Filtering and analysis functionality for examining specific user cohorts or behavioral patterns within broader journey datasets.

**Uniques vs Totals Counting**: Measurement methodology distinguishing between unique users completing paths versus total instances of path completion events.

**Session-based Analysis**: Path tracking methodology that respects user session boundaries to provide accurate behavioral understanding within defined interaction periods.

**Clock Time Analysis**: Time-based path analysis that incorporates real-world timing constraints and natural user behavior patterns.

## Ecosystem Integration and Platform Evolution

Journeys represents a strategic consolidation of Amplitude's path analysis capabilities, specifically migrating and enhancing functionality from legacy Journeys and Pathfinder Users charts. This unification provides users with a streamlined analytical interface while maintaining backward compatibility and preserving established analytical workflows.

The platform integrates with Amplitude's session tracking infrastructure to deliver accurate user journey mapping and supports cohort creation workflows that feed into other Amplitude analysis tools. The seamless conversion capability from Pathfinder visualizations to funnel analysis creates an integrated analytical pipeline for comprehensive conversion optimization efforts.

## Analysis Capabilities and Methodologies

The platform supports dual analysis methodologies through both session-based and clock time frameworks, allowing teams to select the most appropriate measurement approach for their specific analytical requirements. Advanced event filtering and exclusion capabilities enable precise path definition, while sophisticated repeated event handling ensures accurate representation of complex user behavior patterns.

Path percentage calculations provide quantitative insights into conversion rates and drop-off analysis, while detailed friction point identification highlights specific user experience obstacles. The platform's event sequence handling with property-based expansion supports sophisticated segmentation and behavioral analysis across different user contexts, product variations, and demographic segments, enabling teams to understand how various factors influence user journey completion and optimization opportunities.
