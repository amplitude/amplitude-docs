## Amplitude Journeys: User Path Analysis and Conversion Tracking Platform

Amplitude Journeys is a comprehensive user path analysis platform that combines legacy Journeys functionality with Pathfinder Users charts to provide deep insights into user conversion paths and behavioral flows within digital products. The platform enables product teams to visualize, analyze, and optimize user journeys between key product transition points through two primary visualization modes and advanced filtering capabilities.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Journeys platform operates through a unified chart system that integrates two complementary analytical approaches:

**Pathfinder Visualization** serves as the high-level exploration tool, providing broad path discovery capabilities for understanding user flow patterns across the product ecosystem. This visualization excels at revealing the frequency and distribution of different user paths, making it ideal for initial exploration and identifying significant behavioral patterns.

**Journey Map Visualization** functions as the detailed analysis companion, offering granular path comparison capabilities with sophisticated conversion window settings and comprehensive event filtering. This mode enables precise examination of specific user journeys and detailed conversion analysis between defined product states.

The relationship between these visualizations creates a hierarchical analysis workflow where Pathfinder provides the strategic overview while Journey Map delivers tactical insights. Both visualizations share core functionality including event property expansion, session-based analysis, and path transition tracking, but differ in their analytical depth and use case optimization.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Conversion Paths**: The sequential flow of user actions between defined product transition points, representing the journey users take to complete desired outcomes.

**Path Transitions**: Individual steps or movements between events within a user's journey, forming the building blocks of conversion paths.

**Conversion Window**: The time-based parameter that defines the acceptable duration for completing a conversion path, with different logic applied across visualization types.

**Event Filtering**: The capability to narrow analysis scope by applying property-based filters to events within user paths.

**Event Expansion by Property**: The functionality to break down events into sub-categories based on event properties, enabling more granular path analysis.

**Session-based Analysis**: The analytical approach that groups user actions within defined session boundaries for path tracking and conversion measurement.

**Uniques vs Totals Counting**: The measurement methodology distinction where uniques count individual users while totals count all instances of path completion.

**Starting/Ending/Between Events**: The categorical framework for defining event roles within conversion paths, establishing journey boundaries and intermediate steps.

**Path Frequency Analysis**: The quantitative assessment of how often specific user paths occur within the analyzed dataset.

**Dropped-off Users**: Users who begin but do not complete defined conversion paths, though cohort creation for these users faces limitations due to session event constraints.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Journeys integrates deeply within Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem, maintaining backward compatibility with legacy Journeys and Pathfinder Users charts while extending functionality through modern visualization capabilities. The platform connects to Amplitude's core event tracking infrastructure, leveraging session management and event property systems for comprehensive user behavior analysis.

The integration enables seamless funnel creation from Pathfinder visualizations, allowing users to transition from path exploration to conversion optimization workflows. However, certain legacy features like microscope actions face restrictions in the new implementation, and cohort creation capabilities are limited for dropped-off users due to session event architectural constraints.

The platform's session-based analysis approach aligns with Amplitude's broader user behavior tracking methodology, ensuring consistency across the analytics suite while providing specialized path analysis capabilities that complement other Amplitude products like funnels, retention analysis, and user segmentation tools.

## Technical Capabilities and Limitations

The Journeys platform processes user path data through sophisticated conversion window logic that differs from legacy implementations, providing more accurate path attribution and timing analysis. The system supports complex event property filtering and expansion capabilities, enabling detailed behavioral segmentation within path analysis.

Key technical limitations include the inability to create cohorts from dropped-off users due to session event processing constraints, and restrictions on certain microscope actions that were available in legacy versions. These limitations reflect architectural decisions that prioritize performance and accuracy in path analysis while maintaining system scalability for large-scale user behavior datasets.
