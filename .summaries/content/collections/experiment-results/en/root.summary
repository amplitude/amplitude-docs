## Amplitude Experiment Results

Amplitude Experiment Results is an analytics feature designed for Analytics customers who use non-Amplitude feature flagging platforms but want to leverage Amplitude's powerful A/B test analysis capabilities. This feature enables organizations to analyze experiments conducted through external feature flagging systems by configuring exposure events, variants, and metrics within Amplitude's interface.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

The Experiment Results feature operates as a bridge between external feature flagging platforms and Amplitude's analytics engine. The core workflow involves:

- **Exposure Event Configuration**: Setting up events that track when users are exposed to different experiment variants
- **Variant Management**: Defining control groups and treatment variants for experiments
- **Metric Analysis**: Configuring various metric types to measure experiment performance
- **Statistical Analysis**: Applying statistical methods to determine significance and confidence

The feature integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics platform through the Primary Metric module and leverages the platform's event tracking infrastructure to analyze experiments conducted elsewhere.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Concepts:**
- **Experiment Results Chart**: The primary interface for visualizing and analyzing A/B test results
- **Exposure Events**: Events that indicate when a user has been exposed to a specific experiment variant
- **Exposure Attribution Window**: The time period during which user actions are attributed to experiment exposure
- **Variants**: Different versions of a feature being tested, including control groups and treatment groups
- **Cumulative Exposure Tracking**: Monitoring the total number of users exposed to each variant over time

**Metric Types:**
- **Unique Conversions**: Count of distinct users who performed a specific action
- **Event Totals**: Total number of times an event occurred
- **Sum/Average Property Value**: Aggregated numerical values from event properties
- **Funnel Conversion**: Percentage of users completing a sequence of actions
- **Retention Metrics**: User return behavior over specified time periods
- **Formula Metrics**: Custom calculations combining multiple data points

**Statistical Methods:**
- **Sequential Testing**: Continuous monitoring approach allowing for early stopping decisions
- **T-test**: Traditional statistical hypothesis testing method
- **CUPED (Controlled-experiment Using Pre-Experiment Data)**: Variance reduction technique
- **Confidence Interval Charts**: Visual representation of statistical uncertainty

## Formula Metrics System

The formula metrics functionality provides advanced analytical capabilities through specific functions:

**Supported Functions:**
- `UNIQUES`: Count distinct users (uses HyperLogLog algorithm for efficiency)
- `TOTALS`: Sum total event occurrences
- `PROPSUM`: Sum property values across events
- `PROPAVG`: Calculate average property values
- `PROPCOUNT`: Count events with specific property values
- `PROPMAX/PROPMIN`: Find maximum/minimum property values
- `REVENUETOTAL`: Aggregate revenue-specific calculations

**Statistical Calculations:**
The system performs sophisticated statistical analysis including variance calculations, mean computations, p-value determinations, confidence interval generation, and covariance analysis to ensure robust experiment evaluation.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Experiment Results serves as a critical component in Amplitude's analytics ecosystem by:

- **Extending Platform Reach**: Allowing customers using external feature flagging tools to benefit from Amplitude's analytics capabilities
- **Unifying Analysis**: Centralizing experiment analysis regardless of the feature flagging platform used
- **Leveraging Core Infrastructure**: Utilizing Amplitude's event tracking, user segmentation, and statistical analysis engines
- **Supporting Hybrid Architectures**: Enabling organizations with mixed tooling stacks to maintain consistent experiment analysis workflows

The feature represents Amplitude's strategy to provide comprehensive analytics solutions that integrate with existing customer technology stacks rather than requiring complete platform migration. This approach allows organizations to maintain their preferred feature flagging tools while gaining access to Amplitude's advanced experiment analysis capabilities.
