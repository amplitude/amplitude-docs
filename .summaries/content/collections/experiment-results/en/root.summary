2. **Multiple Metric Types Support**:
   - Unique conversions
   - Event totals
   - Sum/average of property values
   - Funnel conversion
   - Formula metrics
   - Retention metrics
3. **Advanced Statistical Analysis**:
   - Sequential testing
   - Confidence interval calculations
   - P-value determinations
4. **Visualization Tools**:
   - Confidence interval charts
   - Cumulative exposure charts
   - Performance by variant charts
   - Mean over time charts
5. **Formula Metrics Engine**: Create custom metrics using mathematical operations and specialized functions

## Product Relationships and Architecture

Experiment Results appears to be a component within Amplitude Analytics that specifically focuses on experiment analysis. It integrates with:

1. **Amplitude Analytics**: The parent platform providing the user interface and data infrastructure
2. **Third-party Feature Flagging Platforms**: Accepts experiment data from external sources
3. **Amplitude Metrics System**: Leverages existing metrics definitions and capabilities

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Exposure Events**: Events that indicate when a user has been exposed to a specific experiment variant
2. **Variants**: Different versions of a feature or experience being tested (e.g., control vs. treatment)
3. **Metric Types**:
   - **Unique Conversions**: Count of unique users who performed a specific action
   - **Event Totals**: Total count of specific events
   - **Property Values**: Sum or average of numeric properties associated with events
   - **Funnel Conversion**: Percentage of users who complete a defined sequence of events
   - **Formula Metrics**: Custom metrics created using mathematical operations and functions
   - **Retention**: Measurement of users returning to perform actions over time
4. **Statistical Settings**:
   - **Sequential Testing**: Statistical approach that allows for continuous monitoring of results
   - **Confidence Interval**: Range of values that likely contains the true value of a metric
   - **P-value**: Probability measure used to determine statistical significance

## Formula Metrics Functions

Experiment Results supports the following specialized functions for formula metrics:

1. **UNIQUES(event_name)**: Counts unique users who performed a specific event
2. **TOTALS(event_name)**: Counts total occurrences of a specific event
3. **PROPSUM(event_name, property_name)**: Sums values of a property across events
4. **PROPAVG(event_name, property_name)**: Calculates average value of a property across events
5. **PROPCOUNT(event_name, property_name)**: Counts occurrences of a property with specific values
6. **PROPMAX(event_name, property_name)**: Returns maximum value of a property
7. **PROPMIN(event_name, property_name)**: Returns minimum value of a property
8. **CONVERSIONRATE(funnel_name)**: Returns conversion rate for a funnel
9. **CONVERSIONAVG(funnel_name)**: Returns average conversion time for a funnel
10. **REVENUETOTAL(event_name)**: Calculates total revenue from an event

## Workflow and Usage

1. **Creating an Experiment Analysis**:
   - Define exposure events that identify experiment participants
   - Select metrics to track
   - Configure statistical settings
   - Define experiment variants

2. **Analyzing Results** through four chart types:
   - **Confidence Interval Chart**: Shows statistical significance of results
   - **Cumulative Exposure Chart**: Tracks experiment participation over time
   - **Performance by Variant Chart**: Compares metric performance across variants
   - **Mean Over Time Chart**: Shows how metrics evolve throughout the experiment

3. **Using Formula Metrics**:
   - Create custom metrics using mathematical operations
   - Combine multiple metrics into a single formula
   - Apply specialized functions for specific analytical needs
   - Amplitude automatically calculates statistical significance for formula metrics

## Statistical Methodology

Amplitude Experiment Results calculates statistical significance for metrics, including formula metrics, through:

1. **Variance Calculation**: Determines the spread of data points
2. **Mean Calculation**: Determines the average value
3. **Confidence Interval Determination**: Establishes the range of likely true values
4. **P-value Calculation**: Determines the probability that observed differences occurred by chance

These calculations are automatically applied to all metrics, including custom formula metrics, ensuring statistical rigor in experiment analysis.
