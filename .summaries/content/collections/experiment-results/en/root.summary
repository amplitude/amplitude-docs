# Amplitude Experiment Results: Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude Experiment Results is a feature within Amplitude Analytics that enables customers to analyze A/B tests from both Amplitude's native experimentation platform and third-party feature flagging platforms. The product allows users to create, track, and analyze experiments with statistical rigor, providing insights into how different variants affect user behavior and business metrics.

## Key Features and Concepts

1. **Cross-Platform Experiment Analysis**: Analyze A/B tests from non-Amplitude feature flagging platforms
2. **Multiple Metric Types Support**: Track various metrics including unique conversions, event totals, property values, funnel conversions, formulas, and retention
3. **Statistical Analysis Tools**: Provides confidence intervals, p-values, and sequential testing capabilities
4. **Visualization Components**: Four key charts for experiment analysis (confidence interval, cumulative exposure, performance by variant, and mean over time)
5. **Formula Metrics**: Create custom metrics using mathematical operations and functions

## Product Relationships and Architecture

Experiment Results is integrated within the Amplitude Analytics ecosystem, allowing it to leverage user behavior data collected by the platform. The product consists of:

1. **Experiment Creation Interface**: Where users define experiment parameters, variants, and metrics
2. **Results Analysis Dashboard**: Visualizations and statistical data for experiment evaluation
3. **Metric Configuration System**: Tools to define and customize metrics for experiment analysis

Experiment Results works by tracking exposure events (when users are assigned to experiment variants) and then analyzing subsequent user behaviors against defined metrics to determine statistical significance between variants.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Exposure Events**: Events that indicate when a user has been exposed to a specific variant in an experiment
2. **Metric Types**:
   - **Unique Conversions**: Count of unique users who performed a specific action
   - **Event Totals**: Total count of specific events
   - **Sum/Average of Property Values**: Calculations based on event property values
   - **Funnel Conversion**: Percentage of users who complete a defined sequence of events
   - **Formula**: Custom metrics created using mathematical operations
   - **Retention**: Measurement of users returning to the product over time

3. **Statistical Terms**:
   - **Confidence Interval**: Range of values that likely contains the true effect of a variant
   - **Sequential Testing**: Statistical method that allows for continuous monitoring of experiments
   - **P-value**: Probability of observing results as extreme as the current results under the null hypothesis

4. **Formula Functions**:
   - **UNIQUES**: Count of unique users performing an event
   - **TOTALS**: Total count of an event
   - **PROPSUM/PROPAVG/PROPCOUNT/PROPMAX/PROPMIN**: Property-based calculations
   - **CONVERSIONRATE/CONVERSIONAVG**: Funnel-based calculations
   - **REVENUETOTAL**: Revenue calculations

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Experiment Results fits into Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem by:

1. Using the same user and event data that powers other Amplitude Analytics features
2. Allowing experiment results to inform product decisions tracked in other Amplitude tools
3. Supporting integration with third-party feature flagging and experimentation platforms
4. Leveraging Amplitude's user segmentation capabilities for experiment analysis

## Technical Implementation

To use Experiment Results, customers need to:

1. Instrument their application to track exposure events with specific properties:
   - Experiment name
   - Variant name
   - User identifier

2. Define metrics for evaluation using the Amplitude interface or API

3. Configure statistical settings including:
   - Confidence level (typically 95%)
   - One or two-tailed tests
   - Sequential testing parameters

The product uses sophisticated statistical methods including HyperLogLog algorithms for unique user counting and variance calculation techniques for determining statistical significance of formula metrics.
