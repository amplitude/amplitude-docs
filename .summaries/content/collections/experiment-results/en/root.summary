## Amplitude Experiment Results

Amplitude Experiment Results is an analytics feature designed for Analytics customers who use non-Amplitude feature flagging platforms to conduct A/B testing. The product enables comprehensive analysis of experiments through statistical measurement, visualization, and interpretation of test results across multiple metric types.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

The Experiment Results feature operates as a standalone analytics layer that integrates with external feature flagging platforms. It consists of two primary components:

**Core Analysis Engine**: Processes experiment data through exposure events and variant configurations, applying statistical methods including sequential testing, T-tests, and CUPED (Controlled-experiment Using Pre-Experiment Data) for variance reduction.

**Formula Metrics System**: Provides advanced metric calculation capabilities through a comprehensive function library that extends the basic metric types with custom mathematical operations and statistical computations.

The relationship between these components is hierarchical - the core engine handles experiment setup, exposure tracking, and basic metric calculations, while the formula metrics system builds upon this foundation to enable complex custom metrics and advanced statistical analysis.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Exposure Events**: User interactions that trigger assignment to experiment variants, forming the basis for statistical analysis and attribution.

**Variant Configuration**: The experimental setup defining control groups and treatment variants for comparison analysis.

**Metric Types**: Six primary categories of measurements:
- **Unique Conversions**: Distinct user actions within the experiment
- **Event Totals**: Aggregate count of specific events
- **Funnel Conversion**: Multi-step conversion process analysis
- **Retention**: User return behavior measurement
- **Formula Metrics**: Custom calculations using predefined functions

**Statistical Methods**:
- **Sequential Testing**: Continuous monitoring approach for ongoing experiments
- **T-test**: Traditional statistical significance testing
- **CUPED**: Variance reduction technique using pre-experiment data
- **Confidence Intervals**: Statistical range estimation for result interpretation

**Formula Functions**: Eleven specialized functions for custom metric creation:
- **UNIQUES**: Distinct user counting using HyperLogLog algorithm
- **TOTALS**: Event aggregation
- **PROPSUM/PROPAVG/PROPCOUNT/PROPMAX/PROPMIN**: Property-based calculations
- **CONVERSIONRATE/CONVERSIONAVG**: Conversion analysis
- **REVENUETOTAL**: Revenue aggregation

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Experiment Results operates within Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem as a specialized experimentation analysis tool. It bridges external feature flagging platforms with Amplitude's statistical analysis capabilities, enabling organizations to maintain their existing experimentation infrastructure while leveraging Amplitude's advanced analytics.

The product integrates with:
- **External Feature Flagging Platforms**: Receives experiment configuration and exposure data
- **Amplitude Analytics**: Utilizes core event tracking and user identification systems
- **Statistical Computing Engine**: Processes variance calculations, covariance analysis, and p-value computations

## Technical Implementation

**Exposure Attribution Settings**: Configure how user exposure to variants is tracked and attributed across the experiment lifecycle.

**Conversion Windows and Latency Offset**: Define time-based parameters for measuring user actions and accounting for data processing delays.

**Performance Visualization**: Multi-dimensional charting system displaying:
- Cumulative exposure tracking over time
- Confidence interval visualization
- Primary and secondary metric performance comparison
- Statistical significance indicators

The formula metrics system supports arithmetic operations, event grouping, and numerical property analysis, with statistical calculations including variance computation through covariance analysis and confidence interval generation for result interpretation.
