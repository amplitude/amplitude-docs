## Amplitude Experiment Results

Amplitude Experiment Results is an A/B testing analysis platform designed for Analytics customers who use non-Amplitude feature flagging platforms but want to leverage Amplitude's advanced statistical analysis capabilities. The product enables organizations to create comprehensive experiments by defining exposure events, configuring variants, and measuring success through multiple metric types.

## Product Relationships and Features

The Experiment Results feature integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem while accommodating external feature flagging systems. Users create experiments by establishing exposure events that trigger when users encounter different variants, then configure success metrics to measure performance across test groups. The platform supports both primary and secondary metrics, with control variant setup for baseline comparisons.

The system provides two main analytical approaches: sequential testing for continuous monitoring and traditional T-tests for fixed-period analysis. Results are visualized through confidence interval charts, cumulative exposure tracking, performance-by-variant analysis, and mean-over-time visualizations. An experiment exposure attribution window ensures proper user assignment and measurement accuracy.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Exposure Events**: Trigger events that indicate when a user encounters a specific experiment variant, forming the foundation for experiment tracking and user attribution.

**Variant Configuration**: The different versions or treatments being tested within an experiment, including the control group used as a baseline for comparison.

**Metric Types**: Six categories of success measurements:
- **Unique Conversions**: Count of distinct users performing target actions
- **Event Totals**: Total occurrences of specific events
- **Sum/Average Property Value**: Aggregated numerical property calculations
- **Funnel Conversion**: Multi-step conversion rate analysis
- **Formula Metrics**: Custom calculations using predefined functions

**Formula Functions**: Eight statistical functions for custom metric creation:
- **UNIQUES**: Distinct user counts using HyperLogLog algorithm
- **TOTALS**: Event occurrence summation
- **PROPSUM**: Property value summation
- **PROPAVG**: Property value averaging
- **PROPCOUNT**: Property occurrence counting
- **PROPMAX/PROPMIN**: Property value extremes
- **REVENUETOTAL**: Revenue-specific calculations

**Statistical Methods**: 
- **Sequential Testing**: Continuous significance monitoring throughout experiment duration
- **T-test**: Traditional fixed-period statistical analysis
- **Variance/Covariance Calculations**: Statistical measures for confidence interval determination

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Experiment Results serves as a bridge between external feature flagging platforms and Amplitude's analytics infrastructure. This positioning allows organizations to maintain their existing feature flag management systems while accessing Amplitude's sophisticated statistical analysis capabilities. The product leverages Amplitude's event tracking and user segmentation foundations, utilizing the platform's data collection and processing capabilities for experiment measurement.

The integration supports Amplitude's Analytics customers specifically, indicating a tiered product approach where advanced experimentation analysis is available to users with comprehensive analytics subscriptions. The system's ability to handle non-Amplitude feature flagging suggests a strategic approach to ecosystem compatibility and customer retention.

## Technical Implementation

The platform processes experiments through exposure event tracking, where users are attributed to variants based on their interaction with feature flags. The experiment exposure attribution window ensures accurate user assignment and prevents data contamination from multiple exposures.

Statistical calculations employ industry-standard methods including HyperLogLog algorithms for unique counting, variance and covariance calculations for confidence intervals, and p-value computations for significance testing. The system supports arithmetic operations within formula metrics, enabling complex custom calculations for specialized business metrics.

Visualization capabilities include confidence interval charts for statistical significance display, cumulative exposure tracking for user acquisition monitoring, and mean-over-time analysis for trend identification across experiment duration.
