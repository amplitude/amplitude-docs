## Amplitude Experiment Results

Amplitude Experiment Results is an advanced A/B testing analysis platform that enables Analytics customers to leverage Amplitude's statistical analysis capabilities regardless of their feature flagging platform. The product provides comprehensive experiment analysis tools through exposure event tracking, variant configuration, and sophisticated statistical testing methodologies.

## Product Relationships and Features

The Experiment Results functionality centers around the **Experiment Results chart**, which serves as the primary interface for A/B test analysis. This chart integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem while accommodating external feature flagging platforms through exposure event mapping.

Key feature relationships include:
- **Exposure Events**: Foundation events that trigger experiment participation tracking
- **Variant Configuration**: Defines test groups and control conditions for statistical comparison
- **Success Metrics**: Multiple metric types that measure experiment outcomes
- **Formula Metrics**: Advanced calculated metrics using predefined functions
- **Statistical Analysis Engine**: Provides significance testing and confidence intervals
