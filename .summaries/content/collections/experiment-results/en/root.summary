# Amplitude Experiment Results: Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude Experiment Results is an analytics tool that enables customers to analyze A/B tests from both Amplitude's native experimentation platform and third-party feature flagging platforms. The product allows users to create, track, and analyze experiments with statistical rigor, providing insights through various visualization charts and metrics.

## Key Features and Capabilities

1. **Cross-Platform Experiment Analysis**: Analyze A/B tests from non-Amplitude feature flagging platforms
2. **Multiple Metric Types Support**:
   - Unique conversions
   - Event totals
   - Sum/average of property values
   - Funnel conversion
   - Formula metrics
   - Retention metrics
3. **Statistical Analysis Tools**:
   - Confidence interval calculations
   - Sequential testing
   - P-value calculations
   - Variance estimation
4. **Visualization Charts**:
   - Confidence interval charts
   - Cumulative exposure charts
   - Performance by variant charts
   - Mean over time charts
5. **Formula Metrics System**: Create custom metrics using mathematical operations and specialized functions

## Product Relationships and Architecture

Experiment Results appears to be a component within Amplitude Analytics that specifically focuses on experimentation analysis. It integrates with:

1. **Amplitude Analytics**: The parent platform providing the user data and event tracking infrastructure
2. **Third-party Feature Flagging Platforms**: Allows importing experiment data from external sources
3. **Amplitude Metrics System**: Leverages Amplitude's metrics definitions and calculations

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Exposure Events**: Events that indicate when a user has been exposed to a specific experiment variant
2. **Variants**: Different versions of a feature or experience being tested (control vs. treatment groups)
3. **Metric Types**:
   - **Unique Conversions**: Count of unique users who performed a specific action
   - **Event Totals**: Total count of specific events
   - **Property Values**: Sum or average of numeric properties associated with events
   - **Funnel Conversion**: Percentage of users who complete a defined sequence of events
   - **Formula Metrics**: Custom metrics created using mathematical operations and functions
   - **Retention**: Measurement of users returning to the product over time
4. **Statistical Settings**:
   - **Sequential Testing**: Statistical approach that allows for continuous monitoring of results
   - **Confidence Interval**: Range of values that likely contains the true effect with a specified probability
   - **P-value**: Probability of observing results at least as extreme as the current data, assuming the null hypothesis is true

## Formula Metrics Functions

Experiment Results supports the following specialized functions for formula metrics:

1. **UNIQUES(event_name)**: Counts unique users who performed the specified event
2. **TOTALS(event_name)**: Counts total occurrences of the specified event
3. **PROPSUM(event_name, property_name)**: Sums the values of a property across events
4. **PROPAVG(event_name, property_name)**: Calculates the average value of a property
5. **PROPCOUNT(event_name, property_name)**: Counts events with a specific property
6. **PROPMAX(event_name, property_name)**: Returns the maximum value of a property
7. **PROPMIN(event_name, property_name)**: Returns the minimum value of a property
8. **CONVERSIONRATE(event_name1, event_name2)**: Calculates conversion rate between two events
9. **CONVERSIONAVG(event_name1, event_name2)**: Calculates average conversion time between events
10. **REVENUETOTAL(event_name)**: Calculates total revenue from an event

## Statistical Methodology

Experiment Results calculates statistical significance for metrics through:

1. **Variance Calculation**: Estimates the variance of metrics to determine confidence intervals
2. **Mean Calculation**: Determines the average effect of each variant
3. **Confidence Intervals**: Visualizes the range of likely true values for the metric
4. **P-values**: Quantifies the statistical significance of observed differences

## Usage Flow

1. Create an experiment by defining exposure events and variants
2. Select or create metrics to track during the experiment
3. Configure statistical settings (significance level, etc.)
4. Analyze results through the four visualization charts:
   - Confidence interval chart: Shows statistical significance of results
   - Cumulative exposure chart: Tracks experiment exposure over time
   - Performance by variant chart: Compares metrics across variants
   - Mean over time chart: Shows how metrics evolve throughout the experiment

The product appears to be designed for data analysts, product managers, and experimentation teams who need to make data-driven decisions based on A/B test results.
