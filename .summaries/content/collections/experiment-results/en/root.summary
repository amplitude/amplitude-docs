## Amplitude Experiment Results

Amplitude's Experiment Results is a comprehensive A/B testing analysis platform that enables teams to analyze experiments from external feature flagging platforms through sophisticated statistical charting and metric evaluation capabilities. The product provides deep analytical insights into experiment performance through configurable metrics, statistical significance testing, and advanced formula-based calculations.

## Product Relationships and Features

The Experiment Results functionality centers around the **Experiment Results chart**, which serves as the primary interface for A/B test analysis. This chart integrates with external feature flagging platforms to provide unified experiment analysis capabilities within Amplitude's analytics ecosystem.

The product consists of two main analytical components:

**Core Analysis Engine**: Handles standard metric types including unique conversions, event totals, sum/average property values, funnel conversions, retention metrics, and basic formula calculations. This engine manages exposure event tracking, variant definition, and statistical significance calculations using both T-test and Sequential testing methodologies.

**Formula Metrics Engine**: Provides advanced custom metric creation through a comprehensive function library, enabling complex calculations that combine multiple data sources and apply sophisticated statistical methods including the HyperLogLog algorithm for unique count estimations.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Exposure Events**: The foundational tracking mechanism that defines when users are exposed to experiment variants, serving as the basis for all subsequent metric calculations and statistical analysis.

**Variant Definition**: The configuration system that categorizes experiment participants into different test groups (control, treatment variants) based on feature flag assignments from external platforms.

**Sequential Testing**: An advanced statistical methodology that allows for continuous monitoring of experiment results with controlled false positive rates, contrasting with traditional T-test approaches that require predetermined sample sizes.

**CUPED (Controlled-experiment Using Pre-Experiment Data)**: A variance reduction technique that improves statistical power by incorporating pre-experiment user behavior data into the analysis.

**Cumulative Exposure Tracking**: The system for monitoring user exposure patterns over time, enabling proper attribution of user actions to experiment variants.

**Formula Functions**: A comprehensive library of analytical functions including:
- **UNIQUES**: Counts distinct users using HyperLogLog approximation
- **TOTALS**: Aggregates event counts
- **PROPSUM/PROPAVG/PROPCOUNT/PROPMAX/PROPMIN**: Property-based calculations
- **CONVERSIONRATE/CONVERSIONAVG**: Conversion-focused metrics
- **REVENUETOTAL**: Revenue aggregation functions

**Conversion Window**: The time period after exposure during which user actions are attributed to the experiment variant.

**Latency Offset**: A timing adjustment mechanism that accounts for data processing delays in experiment attribution.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Experiment Results operates as a bridge between external feature flagging platforms and Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem. The product ingests experiment data from third-party feature flag providers and applies Amplitude's advanced statistical and analytical capabilities to generate insights.

The platform integrates with Amplitude's core event tracking infrastructure, leveraging existing user behavior data to enhance experiment analysis through techniques like CUPED. The formula metrics system connects to Amplitude's broader metric calculation engine, allowing experiment results to be incorporated into dashboards, alerts, and other analytical workflows.

The statistical engine supports both real-time analysis through sequential testing and traditional fixed-horizon analysis, making it suitable for various experimental methodologies and organizational preferences.

## Technical Implementation

The product processes experiment data through exposure event configuration, where teams define the events that trigger experiment exposure tracking. Variant assignment is handled through integration with external feature flagging platforms, with Amplitude providing the analytical layer for result interpretation.

Statistical calculations include confidence interval analysis, p-value computation, variance and covariance calculations for formula metrics, and support for both primary and secondary metric evaluation. The system handles complex scenarios including user re-exposure, variant switching, and time-based attribution windows.

The formula metrics system supports arithmetic operations and nested function calls, enabling sophisticated custom metric creation that can combine multiple event types, user properties, and conversion patterns into single analytical measures.
