# Amplitude Experiment Results

## Overview

Amplitude Experiment Results is a feature within Amplitude Analytics that enables customers to analyze A/B test data from both Amplitude and non-Amplitude feature flagging platforms. The tool provides comprehensive statistical analysis capabilities for experiment data, allowing users to evaluate the performance of different variants across multiple metric types.

Key features include:
- Statistical analysis tools (sequential testing, confidence intervals)
- Support for various metric types (conversions, event totals, funnels, formulas, retention)
- Variant performance comparisons
- Integration with non-Amplitude feature flagging platforms
- Formula metrics with multiple supported functions

## Product Relationships and Features

Experiment Results integrates with the broader Amplitude Analytics ecosystem while also supporting external feature flagging platforms. The feature consists of:

1. **Experiment Results Chart**: The primary interface for analyzing A/B test data, displaying variant performance and statistical significance.

2. **Exposure Events**: The mechanism by which Amplitude tracks which users are exposed to which experiment variants.

3. **Metric Types Support**: The ability to analyze different types of metrics:
   - Conversion metrics
   - Event total metrics
   - Funnel metrics
   - Formula metrics
   - Retention metrics

4. **Formula Metrics**: A specialized feature allowing users to create custom metrics using mathematical functions and operations.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Exposure Events**: Events that indicate when a user has been exposed to a specific variant in an experiment.

- **Cumulative Exposure**: Tracking of user exposure to variants over time.

- **Statistical Significance**: The determination of whether observed differences between variants are likely due to the experimental changes rather than random chance.

- **Sequential Testing**: A statistical approach that allows for continuous monitoring of experiment results without inflating false positive rates.

- **Confidence Intervals**: Ranges that indicate the precision of the estimated effect of a variant.

- **Formula Metrics**: Custom metrics created using mathematical functions and operations on existing metrics.

- **Variants**: Different versions of a feature or experience being tested against each other.

## Formula Metrics Functions

Experiment Results supports the following functions for formula metrics:

- **UNIQUES**: Counts unique users who performed an event
- **TOTALS**: Counts total occurrences of an event
- **PROPSUM**: Sums property values
- **PROPAVG**: Calculates average of property values
- **PROPCOUNT**: Counts events with a property
- **PROPMAX**: Finds maximum property value
- **PROPMIN**: Finds minimum property value
- **CONVERSIONRATE**: Calculates conversion rate
- **CONVERSIONAVG**: Calculates average conversions
- **REVENUETOTAL**: Calculates total revenue

Statistical significance for formula metrics is calculated through variance and mean calculations specific to each function type.

## Integration with Amplitude Ecosystem

Experiment Results appears to be a component of Amplitude Analytics that enhances the platform's experimentation capabilities. It allows users to:

1. Import experiment data from non-Amplitude feature flagging platforms
2. Analyze experiment results using Amplitude's analytics capabilities
3. Create custom metrics to evaluate experiment performance
4. Make data-driven decisions based on statistical analysis

The product extends Amplitude's core analytics functionality by providing specialized tools for experimentation analysis, making it valuable for product teams conducting A/B tests.

## API and Usage

While specific API endpoints aren't explicitly mentioned in the documentation, the product is used through the Experiment Results chart interface within Amplitude Analytics. Users can:

1. Create and configure formula metrics using supported functions
2. Analyze experiment data through the chart interface
3. Compare variant performance across different metrics
4. Evaluate statistical significance of results
