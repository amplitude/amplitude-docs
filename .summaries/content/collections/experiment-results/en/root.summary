## Amplitude Experiment Results

Amplitude's Experiment Results is a comprehensive A/B testing analysis platform designed for Analytics customers who use non-Amplitude feature flagging platforms but want to leverage Amplitude's advanced statistical analysis capabilities. The product enables organizations to create sophisticated experiment analysis charts by connecting their existing feature flag implementations with Amplitude's analytics engine.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Experiment Results platform centers around the **Experiment Results chart**, which serves as the primary interface for A/B test analysis. This chart system integrates several core components:

**Exposure and Variant Management**: The platform uses exposure events to track when users encounter different experiment variants. Users configure variant settings within the chart interface, establishing the foundation for statistical comparison across test groups.

**Multi-Modal Metrics System**: The platform supports six distinct metric types that work together to provide comprehensive experiment analysis:
- **Unique conversions** and **event totals** for basic conversion tracking
- **Sum/average property value** metrics for quantitative analysis
- **Funnel conversion** metrics for multi-step process optimization
- **Retention metrics** for long-term user behavior analysis
- **Formula metrics** for custom calculations and complex business logic

**Statistical Analysis Engine**: Three statistical methodologies power the analysis:
- **Sequential testing** for continuous monitoring
- **T-tests** for traditional hypothesis testing
- **CUPED (Controlled-experiment Using Pre-Experiment Data)** for variance reduction

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Exposure Events**: The fundamental tracking mechanism that records when users are exposed to specific experiment variants, forming the basis for all statistical calculations.

**Exposure Attribution Window**: The time period during which user actions are attributed to their experiment exposure, critical for accurate metric calculation.

**Primary vs Secondary Metrics**: Primary metrics represent the main success criteria for experiments, while secondary metrics provide additional insights and guard against negative side effects.

**Cumulative Exposure**: The running total of users exposed to experiment variants over time, essential for understanding experiment reach and statistical power.

**Confidence Intervals**: Statistical ranges that indicate the precision of metric estimates, helping determine the reliability of experiment results.

## Formula Metrics Subsystem

The formula metrics capability represents a sophisticated sub-product within Experiment Results, supporting eleven specialized functions:

**Basic Event Functions**:
- `UNIQUES`: Counts unique users (using HyperLogLog algorithm)
- `TOTALS`: Counts total events

**Property-Based Functions**:
- `PROPSUM`, `PROPAVG`, `PROPCOUNT`, `PROPMAX`, `PROPMIN`: Aggregate numerical properties across events

**Conversion Functions**:
- `CONVERSIONRATE`, `CONVERSIONAVG`: Calculate conversion metrics with configurable windows

**Revenue Function**:
- `REVENUETOTAL`: Specialized revenue calculation

The formula system includes advanced statistical calculations for variance, covariance, and p-values, enabling sophisticated custom metrics that maintain statistical rigor.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Experiment Results operates as a bridge product within Amplitude's ecosystem, specifically designed for customers using external feature flagging platforms (non-Amplitude solutions) while wanting to retain Amplitude's analytics capabilities. This positioning suggests integration with:

- External feature flag providers through event-based data ingestion
- Amplitude's core Analytics platform for data processing and visualization
- Growth and Enterprise tier services, indicating this is a premium offering

The platform supports **latency offset** configurations and **conversion windows**, suggesting integration with real-time data pipelines and batch processing systems for handling different data freshness requirements.

## Technical Implementation

While specific API endpoints aren't detailed in the documentation, the platform operates through:
- Chart configuration interfaces for setting up experiments
- Event-based data ingestion for exposure and conversion tracking
- Statistical computation engines for real-time analysis
- Formula parsing and execution systems for custom metrics

The architecture supports both real-time sequential testing and batch-processed traditional statistical analysis, indicating a flexible backend capable of handling different experimental methodologies and data processing requirements.
