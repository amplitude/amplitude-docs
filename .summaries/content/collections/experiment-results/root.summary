## Amplitude Experiment Results

Amplitude Experiment Results is an analytics feature designed for customers using non-Amplitude feature flagging platforms who want to leverage Amplitude's advanced statistical analysis capabilities for A/B test evaluation. The product enables comprehensive experiment analysis through Amplitude's interface by connecting external feature flag data with Amplitude's event tracking and statistical modeling.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Experiment Results system operates through several interconnected components:

**Core Analysis Engine**: The Experiment Results chart serves as the primary interface for A/B test analysis, processing exposure events and variant configurations to generate statistical insights.

**Metric System**: The platform supports multiple metric types that work together to provide comprehensive experiment evaluation:
- Unique conversions and event totals for basic counting metrics
- Sum/average property value calculations for numerical analysis
- Funnel conversion metrics for multi-step process optimization
- Retention metrics for long-term user behavior analysis
- Formula metrics for custom calculations combining multiple data points

**Statistical Framework**: Two primary statistical approaches are supported - Sequential testing for continuous monitoring and T-tests for fixed-horizon analysis, both enhanced with CUPED (Controlled-experiment Using Pre-Experiment Data) support for variance reduction.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Exposure Events**: The foundational data points that indicate when users encounter different experiment variants, serving as the basis for all statistical calculations.

**Variants**: Different versions of features being tested, including control groups, with each variant representing a distinct experimental condition.

**Attribution Window**: The time period during which user actions are attributed to their exposure to specific experiment variants.

**Formula Functions**: A comprehensive set of statistical functions including:
- `UNIQUES`: Count distinct users using HyperLogLog algorithm
- `TOTALS`: Sum event occurrences
- `PROPSUM/PROPAVG/PROPCOUNT/PROPMAX/PROPMIN`: Property-based calculations
- `CONVERSIONRATE/CONVERSIONAVG`: Conversion-focused metrics
- `REVENUETOTAL`: Revenue aggregation

**Statistical Measures**: The system calculates variance, covariance, confidence intervals, and p-values to determine statistical significance and provide reliable experiment insights.

## Ecosystem Integration

Experiment Results functions as a bridge between external feature flagging platforms and Amplitude's analytics ecosystem. It integrates with:

**Analytics Platform**: Leverages Amplitude's core event tracking infrastructure to capture and process experiment data alongside standard product analytics.

**Feature Flag Platforms**: Connects with non-Amplitude feature flagging tools, allowing organizations to maintain their existing experimentation infrastructure while gaining access to Amplitude's statistical analysis capabilities.

**Metrics Framework**: Utilizes Amplitude's broader metrics system, enabling experiment results to be contextualized within overall product performance and user behavior patterns.

The system supports both primary and secondary metrics configuration, allowing experimenters to define key success criteria while monitoring for potential negative impacts across other important business metrics. Cumulative exposure tracking and confidence interval charts provide ongoing visibility into experiment performance and statistical reliability throughout the test duration.
