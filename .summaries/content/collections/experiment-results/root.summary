# Amplitude Experiment Results: Comprehensive Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude Experiment Results is a specialized analytics tool that enables customers to analyze A/B tests and experiments conducted through both Amplitude's native experimentation platform and third-party feature flagging systems. The product allows users to measure the impact of product changes, feature releases, and user experience modifications by providing robust statistical analysis and visualization capabilities.

Key features include:
- Integration with non-Amplitude feature flagging platforms
- Multiple metric type support for comprehensive experiment analysis
- Statistical significance calculations with sequential testing methodology
- Interactive visualization charts for experiment performance
- Formula metrics for advanced custom analysis

Primary use cases include:
- Analyzing the impact of product changes on user behavior
- Measuring conversion rates between experiment variants
- Tracking revenue impact of feature releases
- Evaluating user retention across different experience versions
- Creating custom metrics to measure specific business outcomes

## Product Relationships and Features

Experiment Results functions as an analytical layer within the broader Amplitude Analytics ecosystem. The product consists of two main components:

1. **Experiment Setup and Configuration**:
   - Allows defining experiment parameters
   - Supports tracking exposure events from external feature flagging systems
   - Enables selection of target metrics and variants to analyze

2. **Results Analysis and Visualization**:
   - Provides four primary visualization charts:
     - Confidence interval charts showing statistical significance
     - Cumulative exposure charts tracking experiment participation
     - Performance by variant charts comparing outcomes
     - Mean over time charts showing metric trends throughout the experiment
   - Supports formula metrics for custom analysis needs

Experiment Results integrates with other Amplitude products by leveraging the core event tracking infrastructure while providing specialized analysis capabilities for experimental data.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Exposure Events**: Events that indicate when a user has been exposed to a specific experiment variant.
- **Variants**: Different versions of a feature or experience being tested (e.g., control vs. treatment).
- **Metric Types**:
  - **Unique Conversions**: Count of unique users who performed a specific action
  - **Event Totals**: Total count of events performed
  - **Sum/Average of Property Values**: Calculations based on event property values
  - **Funnel Conversion**: Percentage of users who complete a defined sequence of events
  - **Formula**: Custom metrics using mathematical expressions
  - **Retention**: Measurement of users returning to the product over time
- **Statistical Significance**: Mathematical determination of whether observed differences between variants are likely due to the experimental change rather than random chance.
- **Sequential Testing**: Statistical methodology that allows for continuous monitoring of experiment results without inflating false positive rates.
- **Confidence Interval**: Range of values that likely contains the true effect of an experiment with a specified probability.
- **P-value**: Probability of observing results at least as extreme as the current data, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

## Formula Metrics Functionality

Formula metrics provide advanced analytical capabilities through a specialized syntax:

- **Supported Functions**:
  - UNIQUES: Count unique users performing an event
  - TOTALS: Count total occurrences of an event
  - PROPSUM: Sum values of an event property
  - PROPAVG: Calculate average of an event property
  - PROPCOUNT: Count occurrences of a property value
  - PROPMAX/PROPMIN: Find maximum/minimum property values
  - CONVERSIONRATE: Calculate conversion percentage
  - CONVERSIONAVG: Calculate average time to conversion
  - REVENUETOTAL: Calculate total revenue

- **Formula Syntax**: Combines functions with arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to create custom metrics.

- **Statistical Calculations**: For formula metrics, Amplitude calculates:
  - Mean values for each variant
  - Variance using the delta method
  - Confidence intervals based on these calculations
  - P-values to determine statistical significance

## Integration in Amplitude Ecosystem

Experiment Results fits into the broader Amplitude product ecosystem by:

1. Leveraging Amplitude's core event tracking infrastructure for data collection
2. Providing specialized analysis for experimental data that complements standard analytics
3. Supporting integration with both Amplitude's native experimentation tools and third-party systems
4. Utilizing Amplitude's visualization capabilities for presenting experiment outcomes

The product appears designed to function as a bridge between experimentation platforms (both native and third-party) and Amplitude's core analytics capabilities, allowing customers to centralize their experiment analysis regardless of which feature flagging system they use.

## Implementation Process

To implement Experiment Results with a non-Amplitude feature flagging system:

1. Track exposure events in Amplitude when users are assigned to experiment variants
2. Create an experiment in Amplitude Experiment Results
3. Define metrics to measure (using standard or formula metrics)
4. Select the exposure event that identifies experiment participants
5. Analyze results through the four visualization charts
6. Make data-driven decisions based on statistical significance and observed trends
