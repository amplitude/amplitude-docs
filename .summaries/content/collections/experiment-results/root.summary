## Amplitude Experiment Results

Amplitude Experiment Results is a comprehensive A/B testing analysis platform designed for Analytics customers who use non-Amplitude feature flagging platforms but want to leverage Amplitude's advanced statistical analysis capabilities. The product enables organizations to create sophisticated experiment analysis charts by connecting exposure events with variants and applying multiple metric types to measure test performance.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Experiment Results system operates through a chart-based interface that integrates three core components: exposure events (which define when users enter an experiment), experiment variants (the different versions being tested), and metrics (the measurements used to evaluate performance). This architecture allows users to maintain their existing feature flagging infrastructure while gaining access to Amplitude's analytics engine.

The platform supports multiple metric types that work together to provide comprehensive experiment analysis:
- **Conversion metrics** (unique conversions and event totals) measure user actions and engagement
- **Funnel conversion metrics** analyze multi-step user journeys and conversion paths
- **Retention metrics** track user behavior over time
- **Formula metrics** enable custom calculations using built-in functions

Statistical analysis capabilities include both sequential testing and traditional T-test methodologies, with CUPED (Controlled-experiment Using Pre-Experiment Data) statistical preferences for improved sensitivity and reduced variance.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Exposure Events**: The triggering events that indicate when a user has been exposed to an experiment variant, serving as the foundation for all subsequent analysis.

**Experiment Variants**: The different versions or treatments being tested within an experiment, including control and treatment groups.

**Primary and Secondary Metrics**: Primary metrics represent the main success criteria for an experiment, while secondary metrics provide additional insights and guard against negative impacts.

**Exposure Attribution Settings**: Configuration options that determine how user exposure to variants is tracked and attributed throughout the experiment duration.

**Confidence Interval Charts**: Visualization tools that display the statistical confidence ranges for metric performance across variants.

**Cumulative Exposure Visualization**: Charts showing the accumulation of user exposure over time, helping identify experiment ramp-up patterns and potential issues.

## Formula Metrics System

The formula metrics component provides advanced calculation capabilities through a comprehensive function library:

- **UNIQUES/TOTALS**: Count unique users or total events using HyperLogLog algorithms for scalable computation
- **Property Functions** (PROPSUM, PROPAVG, PROPCOUNT, PROPMAX, PROPMIN): Aggregate numerical properties from events
- **Conversion Functions** (CONVERSIONRATE, CONVERSIONAVG): Calculate conversion rates and average conversion values
- **REVENUETOTAL**: Aggregate revenue metrics across experiment variants

These functions support arithmetic operations and can be combined to create custom metrics tailored to specific business requirements. The system handles statistical calculations including variance, covariance, and p-values for proper significance testing.

## Statistical Analysis Framework

The platform employs sophisticated statistical methodologies including confidence interval calculations, sequential testing capabilities, and traditional hypothesis testing. Users can configure conversion windows and latency offsets to account for delayed conversions and ensure accurate attribution. The system provides both mean over time charts for trend analysis and performance by variant comparisons for direct variant evaluation.

## Integration and Ecosystem Position

Experiment Results serves as a bridge between external feature flagging platforms and Amplitude's analytics ecosystem, allowing organizations to maintain their existing experimentation infrastructure while accessing advanced statistical analysis tools. The product integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics platform, enabling users to leverage existing event data, user properties, and segmentation capabilities within their experiment analysis workflows.

The system supports real-time analysis with configurable exposure attribution settings and provides comprehensive visualization tools including performance charts, confidence interval displays, and cumulative exposure tracking to support data-driven experimentation decisions.
