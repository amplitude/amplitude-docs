## Amplitude Experiment Results

Amplitude Experiment Results is an analytics feature that enables Analytics customers using external feature flagging platforms to leverage Amplitude's A/B test analysis capabilities. The product serves as a bridge between third-party feature flagging systems and Amplitude's analytics engine, allowing organizations to analyze experiments conducted through external platforms while maintaining their existing tooling infrastructure.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

The Experiment Results feature operates within a hybrid architecture model, connecting external feature flagging platforms to Amplitude's core analytics infrastructure. The system centers around the **Experiment Results Chart**, which serves as the primary interface for visualization and analysis.

The workflow integrates several key components:
- **Exposure Event Configuration** tracks when users encounter different experiment variants
- **Variant Management** defines control and treatment groups for experiments
- **Metric Analysis** configures performance measurement parameters
- **Statistical Analysis Engine** applies various statistical methods for significance testing

The feature leverages Amplitude's existing **Primary Metric module** and event tracking infrastructure, creating a unified analysis environment regardless of the underlying feature flagging platform.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Experiment Concepts:**
- **Exposure Events**: Events indicating user exposure to specific experiment variants
- **Exposure Attribution Window**: Time period for attributing user actions to experiment exposure
- **Variants**: Different feature versions being tested (control groups and treatment groups)
- **Cumulative Exposure Tracking**: Monitoring total users exposed to each variant over time

**Metric Classifications:**
- **Unique Conversions**: Distinct user count performing specific actions
- **Event Totals**: Total occurrences of specific events
- **Sum/Average Property Value**: Aggregated numerical values from event properties
- **Funnel Conversion**: Completion percentage for action sequences
- **Retention Metrics**: User return behavior over specified periods
- **Formula Metrics**: Custom calculations combining multiple data points

**Statistical Methodologies:**
- **Sequential Testing**: Continuous monitoring with early stopping capabilities
- **T-test**: Traditional statistical hypothesis testing
- **CUPED (Controlled-experiment Using Pre-Experiment Data)**: Variance reduction technique
- **Confidence Interval Charts**: Visual statistical uncertainty representation

## Formula Metrics System

The formula metrics functionality provides advanced analytical capabilities through specific computational functions:

**Core Functions:**
- `UNIQUES`: Distinct user counting using HyperLogLog algorithm
- `TOTALS`: Event occurrence summation
- `PROPSUM`: Property value aggregation
- `PROPAVG`: Property value averaging
- `PROPCOUNT`: Event counting with specific property values
- `PROPMAX/PROPMIN`: Property value extremes identification
- `REVENUETOTAL`: Revenue-specific aggregation calculations

The system performs comprehensive statistical analysis including variance calculations, mean computations, p-value determinations, confidence interval generation, and covariance analysis for robust experiment evaluation.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Experiment Results functions as a strategic component within Amplitude's analytics ecosystem by extending platform capabilities to customers with diverse technology stacks. The feature enables **platform reach extension** by accommodating external feature flagging tools while providing access to Amplitude's advanced analytics.

The integration strategy supports **hybrid architectures** where organizations can maintain preferred feature flagging platforms while centralizing experiment analysis through Amplitude. This approach leverages Amplitude's core infrastructure including event tracking, user segmentation, and statistical analysis engines.

The product represents Amplitude's broader strategy of providing comprehensive analytics solutions that integrate with existing customer technology rather than requiring complete platform migration. This positioning allows organizations to benefit from Amplitude's sophisticated experiment analysis capabilities while preserving their established feature flagging workflows and tooling investments.
