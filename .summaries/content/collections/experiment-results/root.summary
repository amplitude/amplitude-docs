# Amplitude Experiment Results

## Product Overview

Amplitude Experiment Results is an advanced analytics tool for analyzing A/B tests from both Amplitude's native experimentation platform and third-party feature flagging platforms. The product enables users to create, track, and analyze experiments with statistical rigor, providing actionable insights through various visualization charts and metrics.

## Key Features

- **Cross-Platform Analysis**: Analyze experiments from Amplitude and third-party feature flagging platforms
- **Comprehensive Metric Support**: Track unique conversions, event totals, property values, funnel conversions, formula metrics, and retention metrics
- **Statistical Analysis Tools**: Leverage confidence intervals, sequential testing, p-value calculations, and variance estimation
- **Visualization Charts**: View results through confidence interval charts, cumulative exposure charts, performance by variant charts, and mean over time charts
- **Formula Metrics System**: Create custom metrics using mathematical operations and specialized functions

## Product Relationships

Experiment Results functions as a component within the broader Amplitude Analytics ecosystem:

1. It integrates directly with Amplitude Analytics for user data and event tracking
2. It connects with third-party feature flagging platforms to import external experiment data
3. It leverages Amplitude's metrics system for definitions and calculations
4. It serves as the analytical engine for experiment evaluation within the Amplitude product suite

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Experiment Components
- **Exposure Events**: Events indicating when a user has been exposed to a specific experiment variant
- **Variants**: Different versions of a feature being tested (typically control vs. treatment groups)

### Metric Types
- **Unique Conversions**: Count of unique users performing a specific action
- **Event Totals**: Total count of specific events
- **Property Values**: Sum or average of numeric properties associated with events
- **Funnel Conversion**: Percentage of users completing a defined sequence of events
- **Formula Metrics**: Custom metrics created using mathematical operations
- **Retention**: Measurement of users returning to the product over time

### Statistical Terminology
- **Sequential Testing**: Statistical approach allowing continuous monitoring of results
- **Confidence Interval**: Range of values likely containing the true effect with specified probability
- **P-value**: Probability of observing results at least as extreme as current data, assuming null hypothesis
- **Variance Estimation**: Method for calculating the statistical variance of metrics

## Formula Metrics Functions

Experiment Results provides specialized functions for formula metrics:

- **UNIQUES(event_name)**: Counts unique users who performed the specified event
- **TOTALS(event_name)**: Counts total occurrences of the specified event
- **PROPSUM(event_name, property_name)**: Sums property values across events
- **PROPAVG(event_name, property_name)**: Calculates average property value
- **PROPCOUNT(event_name, property_name)**: Counts events with a specific property
- **PROPMAX(event_name, property_name)**: Returns maximum property value
- **PROPMIN(event_name, property_name)**: Returns minimum property value
- **CONVERSIONRATE(event_name1, event_name2)**: Calculates conversion rate between events
- **CONVERSIONAVG(event_name1, event_name2)**: Calculates average conversion time
- **REVENUETOTAL(event_name)**: Calculates total revenue from an event

## Workflow and Usage

The typical workflow for using Amplitude Experiment Results includes:

1. Creating an experiment by defining exposure events and variants
2. Selecting or creating metrics to track during the experiment
3. Configuring statistical settings (significance level, etc.)
4. Analyzing results through the visualization charts:
   - Confidence interval chart for statistical significance
   - Cumulative exposure chart for tracking experiment exposure
   - Performance by variant chart for comparing metrics
   - Mean over time chart for tracking metric evolution

The product is designed for data analysts, product managers, and experimentation teams who need to make data-driven decisions based on rigorous A/B test analysis.
