## Amplitude Experiment Results

Amplitude Experiment Results is a specialized A/B testing analysis platform that serves as a bridge solution for Analytics customers using third-party feature flagging platforms. The product enables organizations to leverage Amplitude's advanced statistical analysis capabilities while maintaining their existing feature flag infrastructure, providing sophisticated experiment analysis through a comprehensive charting and metrics system.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The platform centers around the **Experiment Results chart**, which functions as the primary analytical interface. This chart system orchestrates several interconnected components:

**Exposure and Variant Management** forms the foundational layer, using exposure events to track user encounters with experiment variants. The variant configuration system within the chart interface establishes the framework for statistical comparison across test groups.

**Multi-Modal Metrics System** provides six distinct metric types that work synergistically:
- **Unique conversions** and **event totals** for fundamental conversion tracking
- **Sum/average property value** metrics for quantitative behavioral analysis  
- **Funnel conversion** metrics for multi-step process optimization
- **Retention metrics** for longitudinal user behavior assessment
- **Formula metrics** for custom calculations and complex business logic implementation

**Statistical Analysis Engine** employs three methodological approaches:
- **Sequential testing** for continuous experiment monitoring
- **T-tests** for traditional hypothesis validation
- **CUPED (Controlled-experiment Using Pre-Experiment Data)** for variance reduction and improved statistical power

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Exposure Events**: Core tracking mechanism recording user encounters with specific experiment variants, serving as the statistical foundation for all calculations and the primary data input for experiment analysis.

**Exposure Attribution Window**: Temporal boundary defining the period during which user actions are attributed to their experiment exposure, critical for accurate metric calculation and preventing attribution errors.

**Primary vs Secondary Metrics**: Primary metrics represent core success criteria and key performance indicators for experiments, while secondary metrics provide supplementary insights and serve as guardrails against unintended negative consequences.

**Cumulative Exposure**: Running aggregate of users exposed to experiment variants over time, essential for understanding experiment reach, statistical power calculations, and determining when sufficient sample sizes are achieved.

**Confidence Intervals**: Statistical ranges indicating the precision and reliability of metric estimates, providing bounds for effect size interpretation and supporting decision-making confidence.

**Latency Offset**: Configuration parameter accounting for data processing delays and ensuring accurate temporal alignment between exposure events and outcome measurements.

## Formula Metrics Subsystem

The formula metrics capability represents a sophisticated computational sub-product featuring eleven specialized functions organized into functional categories:

**Basic Event Functions**:
- `UNIQUES`: Unique user counting using HyperLogLog algorithm for memory-efficient cardinality estimation
- `TOTALS`: Total event counting for volume-based metrics

**Property-Based Aggregation Functions**:
- `PROPSUM`, `PROPAVG`, `PROPCOUNT`, `PROPMAX`, `PROPMIN`: Numerical property aggregation across events with statistical rigor

**Conversion Analysis Functions**:
- `CONVERSIONRATE`, `CONVERSIONAVG`: Conversion metric calculation with configurable attribution windows

**Revenue Function**:
- `REVENUETOTAL`: Specialized revenue calculation with business-specific logic

The formula system incorporates advanced statistical computations including variance calculation, covariance analysis, and p-value determination, enabling custom metrics that maintain statistical validity and experimental rigor.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Experiment Results operates as a strategic bridge product within Amplitude's ecosystem, specifically architected for customers utilizing external feature flagging platforms while requiring Amplitude's analytical capabilities. This positioning indicates integration touchpoints with:

- **External Feature Flag Providers**: Event-based data ingestion supporting various third-party flagging systems
- **Amplitude Analytics Platform**: Core data processing, storage, and visualization infrastructure
- **Growth and Enterprise Tiers**: Premium service positioning suggesting advanced feature sets and dedicated support

The platform's support for **conversion windows** and **latency offset** configurations indicates integration with both real-time data pipelines and batch processing systems, accommodating varying data freshness requirements and processing latencies.

## Technical Implementation and Data Flow

The platform operates through a multi-layered technical architecture:

**Data Ingestion Layer**: Event-based system capturing exposure events and outcome measurements from external feature flagging platforms, with configurable latency handling and data validation.

**Statistical Computation Engine**: Real-time and batch processing capabilities supporting both sequential testing methodologies and traditional statistical analysis approaches.

**Chart Configuration System**: User interface for experiment setup, variant definition, metric selection, and analysis parameter configuration.

**Formula Processing Engine**: Parsing and execution system for custom metric calculations, maintaining statistical accuracy across complex business logic implementations.

The architecture supports dual processing modes - real-time sequential testing for continuous monitoring and batch-processed traditional analysis for comprehensive post-experiment evaluation, indicating a flexible backend capable of handling diverse experimental methodologies and varying data processing requirements across different organizational needs and technical constraints.
