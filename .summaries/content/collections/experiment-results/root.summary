# Amplitude Experiment Results

Amplitude Experiment Results is a comprehensive A/B testing analysis platform that bridges external feature flagging platforms with Amplitude's advanced statistical analytics capabilities. The product enables teams to conduct sophisticated experiment analysis through configurable metrics, statistical significance testing, and formula-based calculations, providing deep insights into experiment performance within Amplitude's unified analytics ecosystem.

## Product Relationships and Features

The platform centers around the **Experiment Results chart**, which serves as the primary analytical interface for A/B test evaluation. This chart integrates with external feature flagging platforms to deliver unified experiment analysis capabilities within Amplitude's broader analytics infrastructure.

The architecture comprises two complementary analytical engines:

**Core Analysis Engine** manages standard metric types including unique conversions, event totals, sum/average property values, funnel conversions, retention metrics, and basic formula calculations. This engine handles exposure event tracking, variant definition, and statistical significance calculations using both T-test and Sequential testing methodologies.

**Formula Metrics Engine** enables advanced custom metric creation through a comprehensive function library, supporting complex calculations that combine multiple data sources and apply sophisticated statistical methods including the HyperLogLog algorithm for unique count estimations.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Exposure Events** constitute the foundational tracking mechanism defining when users are exposed to experiment variants, serving as the basis for all subsequent metric calculations and statistical analysis.

**Variant Definition** represents the configuration system categorizing experiment participants into different test groups (control, treatment variants) based on feature flag assignments from external platforms.

**Sequential Testing** is an advanced statistical methodology enabling continuous monitoring of experiment results with controlled false positive rates, contrasting with traditional T-test approaches requiring predetermined sample sizes.

**CUPED (Controlled-experiment Using Pre-Experiment Data)** is a variance reduction technique that improves statistical power by incorporating pre-experiment user behavior data into the analysis framework.

**Cumulative Exposure Tracking** monitors user exposure patterns over time, enabling proper attribution of user actions to experiment variants.

**Formula Functions** comprise a comprehensive analytical library including:
- **UNIQUES**: Counts distinct users using HyperLogLog approximation
- **TOTALS**: Aggregates event counts
- **PROPSUM/PROPAVG/PROPCOUNT/PROPMAX/PROPMIN**: Property-based calculations
- **CONVERSIONRATE/CONVERSIONAVG**: Conversion-focused metrics
- **REVENUETOTAL**: Revenue aggregation functions

**Conversion Window** defines the time period after exposure during which user actions are attributed to the experiment variant.

**Latency Offset** provides a timing adjustment mechanism accounting for data processing delays in experiment attribution.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Experiment Results operates as a strategic bridge between external feature flagging platforms and Amplitude's comprehensive analytics ecosystem. The product ingests experiment data from third-party feature flag providers while applying Amplitude's advanced statistical and analytical capabilities to generate actionable insights.

The platform integrates deeply with Amplitude's core event tracking infrastructure, leveraging existing user behavior data to enhance experiment analysis through techniques like CUPED. The formula metrics system connects to Amplitude's broader metric calculation engine, enabling experiment results to be incorporated into dashboards, alerts, and other analytical workflows throughout the platform.

The statistical engine supports both real-time analysis through sequential testing and traditional fixed-horizon analysis, accommodating various experimental methodologies and organizational preferences across different use cases.

## Technical Implementation

The product processes experiment data through exposure event configuration, where teams define events that trigger experiment exposure tracking. Variant assignment is managed through integration with external feature flagging platforms, with Amplitude providing the sophisticated analytical layer for result interpretation and statistical analysis.

Statistical calculations encompass confidence interval analysis, p-value computation, variance and covariance calculations for formula metrics, and comprehensive support for both primary and secondary metric evaluation. The system handles complex experimental scenarios including user re-exposure, variant switching, and time-based attribution windows.

The formula metrics system supports arithmetic operations and nested function calls, enabling sophisticated custom metric creation that combines multiple event types, user properties, and conversion patterns into unified analytical measures. This flexibility allows teams to create highly specific metrics tailored to their unique experimental objectives and business requirements.
