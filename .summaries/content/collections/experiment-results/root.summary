Amplitude Experiment Results is an A/B testing analysis platform that enables Analytics customers using external feature flagging systems to leverage Amplitude's advanced statistical analysis capabilities. The product allows organizations to create comprehensive experiments through exposure event definition, variant configuration, and multi-dimensional success measurement across different test groups.

## Product Relationships and Features

Experiment Results integrates with Amplitude's analytics ecosystem while accommodating third-party feature flagging platforms. The core workflow involves creating experiments by establishing exposure events that trigger when users encounter variants, then configuring success metrics for performance measurement. The platform supports primary and secondary metrics with control variant baseline comparisons.

The system offers two analytical methodologies: sequential testing for continuous monitoring throughout experiment duration, and traditional T-tests for fixed-period analysis. Results visualization includes confidence interval charts, cumulative exposure tracking, performance-by-variant analysis, and temporal trend monitoring. An experiment exposure attribution window ensures accurate user assignment and measurement integrity.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Exposure Events**: Trigger mechanisms indicating when users encounter specific experiment variants, serving as the foundation for experiment tracking and user attribution to test groups.

**Variant Configuration**: Different experimental treatments being tested, including control groups used as baseline comparisons for statistical analysis.

**Metric Types**: Six categories of success measurements:
- **Unique Conversions**: Distinct user counts performing target actions
- **Event Totals**: Aggregate occurrences of specific events
- **Sum/Average Property Value**: Numerical property aggregations and calculations
- **Funnel Conversion**: Multi-step conversion rate analysis
- **Formula Metrics**: Custom calculations using predefined statistical functions

**Formula Functions**: Eight statistical functions enabling custom metric creation:
- **UNIQUES**: Distinct user counting via HyperLogLog algorithm
- **TOTALS**: Event occurrence summation
- **PROPSUM**: Property value summation
- **PROPAVG**: Property value averaging
- **PROPCOUNT**: Property occurrence counting
- **PROPMAX/PROPMIN**: Property value extremes identification
- **REVENUETOTAL**: Revenue-specific aggregations

**Statistical Methods**:
- **Sequential Testing**: Continuous significance monitoring with real-time statistical evaluation
- **T-test**: Traditional fixed-period hypothesis testing
- **Variance/Covariance Calculations**: Statistical measures for confidence interval determination and significance testing

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Experiment Results functions as a strategic bridge between external feature flagging platforms and Amplitude's analytics infrastructure. This positioning enables organizations to maintain existing feature flag management systems while accessing Amplitude's sophisticated statistical analysis capabilities. The product leverages Amplitude's foundational event tracking, user segmentation, and data processing infrastructure for experiment measurement and analysis.

The platform specifically targets Analytics customers, indicating a tiered product strategy where advanced experimentation analysis is available to users with comprehensive analytics subscriptions. The compatibility with non-Amplitude feature flagging systems demonstrates strategic ecosystem integration and customer retention approaches.

## Technical Implementation

The platform processes experiments through exposure event tracking, attributing users to variants based on feature flag interactions. The experiment exposure attribution window prevents data contamination from multiple exposures and ensures statistical validity.

Statistical processing employs industry-standard methodologies including HyperLogLog algorithms for unique user counting, variance and covariance calculations for confidence interval computation, and p-value calculations for significance determination. Formula metrics support arithmetic operations, enabling complex custom calculations for specialized business requirements.

Visualization capabilities encompass confidence interval charts for significance display, cumulative exposure tracking for user acquisition monitoring, performance-by-variant comparisons, and mean-over-time analysis for trend identification across experiment lifecycles. The system maintains statistical rigor while providing accessible visual interpretation of experimental results.
