# Amplitude Experiment Results

Amplitude Experiment Results is an analytics platform designed for organizations using external feature flagging systems to conduct A/B testing. The product provides comprehensive statistical analysis, visualization, and interpretation capabilities for experiment data, enabling teams to measure the impact of their experiments across multiple metric types while maintaining their existing experimentation infrastructure.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The platform operates through two interconnected layers that work together to provide complete experiment analysis:

**Core Analysis Engine** serves as the foundational layer, handling experiment setup, exposure tracking, and statistical processing. This engine processes exposure events and variant configurations, applying advanced statistical methods including sequential testing, T-tests, and CUPED (Controlled-experiment Using Pre-Experiment Data) for variance reduction.

**Formula Metrics System** builds upon the core engine to provide advanced metric calculation capabilities. This system extends basic metric types through a comprehensive function library that enables custom mathematical operations and complex statistical computations.

The relationship is hierarchical - the core engine establishes the experimental framework and handles basic measurements, while the formula metrics system leverages this foundation to enable sophisticated custom analytics and advanced statistical analysis.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Exposure Events** are user interactions that trigger assignment to experiment variants, serving as the fundamental data points for statistical analysis and result attribution.

**Variant Configuration** defines the experimental structure, including control groups and treatment variants that form the basis for comparative analysis.

**Metric Types** encompass six primary measurement categories:
- **Unique Conversions**: Distinct user actions measured within the experiment timeframe
- **Event Totals**: Aggregate counts of specific user events
- **Funnel Conversion**: Multi-step conversion process analysis tracking user progression
- **Retention**: Measurement of user return behavior and engagement patterns
- **Formula Metrics**: Custom calculations utilizing predefined mathematical functions

**Statistical Methods** include:
- **Sequential Testing**: Continuous monitoring methodology for real-time experiment evaluation
- **T-test**: Traditional statistical significance testing for result validation
- **CUPED**: Variance reduction technique leveraging pre-experiment data to improve statistical power
- **Confidence Intervals**: Statistical range estimation providing result interpretation boundaries

**Formula Functions** comprise eleven specialized calculation types:
- **UNIQUES**: Distinct user counting using HyperLogLog algorithm for scalable unique value estimation
- **TOTALS**: Event aggregation across experiment populations
- **PROPSUM/PROPAVG/PROPCOUNT/PROPMAX/PROPMIN**: Property-based calculations for numerical event attributes
- **CONVERSIONRATE/CONVERSIONAVG**: Conversion analysis functions for success rate measurement
- **REVENUETOTAL**: Revenue aggregation for financial impact analysis

## Ecosystem Integration

Experiment Results functions as a bridge between external experimentation platforms and Amplitude's analytics infrastructure. The product integrates with multiple system layers:

**External Feature Flagging Platforms** provide experiment configuration data and exposure event streams, allowing organizations to maintain their existing experimentation tools while accessing advanced analytics capabilities.

**Amplitude Analytics Core** supplies foundational event tracking, user identification, and data processing infrastructure that powers the experiment analysis engine.

**Statistical Computing Engine** processes complex calculations including variance analysis, covariance computations, and p-value generation for statistical significance determination.

## Technical Implementation

**Exposure Attribution Settings** control how user exposure to experiment variants is tracked and attributed throughout the experiment lifecycle, ensuring accurate statistical analysis.

**Conversion Windows and Latency Offset** define temporal parameters for measuring user actions and accounting for data processing delays, critical for accurate time-based analysis.

**Performance Visualization System** provides multi-dimensional analytics through:
- Cumulative exposure tracking displaying user assignment patterns over time
- Confidence interval visualization showing statistical certainty ranges
- Primary and secondary metric performance comparison across variants
- Statistical significance indicators providing clear result interpretation

The formula metrics system supports comprehensive mathematical operations including arithmetic calculations, event grouping, and numerical property analysis. Statistical processing includes variance computation through covariance analysis and confidence interval generation, enabling robust result interpretation and decision-making support for experiment outcomes.
