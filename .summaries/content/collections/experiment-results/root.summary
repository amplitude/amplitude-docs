# Amplitude Experiment Results: Product Overview

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude Experiment Results is a comprehensive experimentation analysis tool within Amplitude Analytics that enables users to analyze A/B tests from both Amplitude's native experimentation platform and third-party feature flagging platforms. The product provides statistical rigor to experiment analysis, allowing users to track how different variants affect user behavior and business metrics through various visualization tools and statistical methods.

Key features include cross-platform experiment analysis, support for multiple metric types, robust statistical analysis tools, and visualization components that help interpret experiment results. The product is designed to help product teams make data-driven decisions by providing clear insights into the performance of different product variants.

## Product Relationships and Features

Experiment Results is tightly integrated within the Amplitude Analytics ecosystem, leveraging the platform's user behavior data collection capabilities. The product architecture consists of:

1. **Experiment Creation Interface** - Where users define experiment parameters, variants, and metrics to be tracked
2. **Results Analysis Dashboard** - Provides visualizations and statistical data for evaluating experiment outcomes
3. **Metric Configuration System** - Tools for defining and customizing metrics used in experiment analysis

The product works by tracking exposure events (when users are assigned to experiment variants) and analyzing subsequent user behaviors against defined metrics to determine statistical significance between variants. This allows teams to understand which product variations drive better outcomes.

Experiment Results supports integration with third-party feature flagging platforms, making it versatile for organizations using multiple experimentation tools while wanting centralized analysis.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Exposure Events**: Events that indicate when a user has been exposed to a specific variant in an experiment. These must include:
   - Experiment name
   - Variant name
   - User identifier

2. **Metric Types**:
   - **Unique Conversions**: Count of unique users who performed a specific action
   - **Event Totals**: Total count of specific events
   - **Sum/Average of Property Values**: Calculations based on event property values
   - **Funnel Conversion**: Percentage of users who complete a defined sequence of events
   - **Formula**: Custom metrics created using mathematical operations
   - **Retention**: Measurement of users returning to the product over time

3. **Statistical Terms**:
   - **Confidence Interval**: Range of values that likely contains the true effect of a variant
   - **Sequential Testing**: Statistical method allowing continuous monitoring of experiments
   - **P-value**: Probability of observing results as extreme as the current results under the null hypothesis

4. **Formula Functions**:
   - **UNIQUES**: Count of unique users performing an event
   - **TOTALS**: Total count of an event
   - **PROPSUM/PROPAVG/PROPCOUNT/PROPMAX/PROPMIN**: Property-based calculations
   - **CONVERSIONRATE/CONVERSIONAVG**: Funnel-based calculations
   - **REVENUETOTAL**: Revenue calculations

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Experiment Results is positioned as a key component in Amplitude's analytics ecosystem:

1. It uses the same user and event data that powers other Amplitude Analytics features
2. Experiment results can inform product decisions tracked in other Amplitude tools
3. It supports integration with third-party feature flagging and experimentation platforms
4. The product leverages Amplitude's user segmentation capabilities for more granular experiment analysis

This integration allows organizations to maintain a consistent data foundation across their experimentation and analytics workflows, reducing data silos and enabling more cohesive product development processes.

## Technical Implementation

To implement Experiment Results, customers need to:

1. Instrument their application to track exposure events with specific properties including experiment name, variant name, and user identifier
2. Define metrics for evaluation using the Amplitude interface or API
3. Configure statistical settings including confidence level (typically 95%), one or two-tailed tests, and sequential testing parameters

The product employs sophisticated statistical methods including HyperLogLog algorithms for unique user counting and specialized variance calculation techniques for determining statistical significance of formula metrics.

The visualization components include four key charts:
- Confidence interval charts
- Cumulative exposure charts
- Performance by variant charts
- Mean over time charts

These visualizations help teams interpret experiment results and make informed decisions about which variants to implement permanently.
