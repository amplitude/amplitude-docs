# Amplitude Experiment Results

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude Experiment Results is an analytics tool for analyzing A/B tests and experiments from both Amplitude's native experimentation platform and third-party feature flagging platforms. The product enables users to create detailed experiment analyses, track various metric types, and visualize results through multiple chart types to make data-driven decisions about feature releases and optimizations.

## Product Relationships and Features

Experiment Results functions as a component within the broader Amplitude Analytics ecosystem, specifically focusing on experiment analysis. It integrates with:

1. **Amplitude Analytics** - Provides the underlying user interface and data infrastructure
2. **Third-party Feature Flagging Platforms** - Accepts and analyzes experiment data from external sources
3. **Amplitude Metrics System** - Leverages existing metrics definitions and capabilities

Key features include:
- Cross-platform experiment analysis for non-Amplitude feature flagging platforms
- Support for multiple metric types (unique conversions, event totals, property values, funnels, formulas, retention)
- Advanced statistical analysis with sequential testing, confidence intervals, and p-value calculations
- Multiple visualization tools including confidence interval charts, cumulative exposure charts, performance by variant charts, and mean over time charts
- Formula metrics engine for creating custom metrics using mathematical operations and specialized functions

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Exposure Events**: Events indicating when a user has been exposed to a specific experiment variant
2. **Variants**: Different versions of a feature or experience being tested (control vs. treatment)
3. **Metric Types**:
   - **Unique Conversions**: Count of unique users performing a specific action
   - **Event Totals**: Total count of specific events
   - **Property Values**: Sum or average of numeric properties associated with events
   - **Funnel Conversion**: Percentage of users completing a defined sequence of events
   - **Formula Metrics**: Custom metrics created using mathematical operations and functions
   - **Retention**: Measurement of users returning to perform actions over time
4. **Statistical Settings**:
   - **Sequential Testing**: Statistical approach allowing continuous monitoring of results
   - **Confidence Interval**: Range of values likely containing the true metric value
   - **P-value**: Probability measure for determining statistical significance

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Experiment Results appears to be tightly integrated with the broader Amplitude Analytics platform. It leverages the core analytics infrastructure while providing specialized functionality for experiment analysis. The product can:

1. Use metrics defined elsewhere in Amplitude
2. Import experiment data from third-party platforms
3. Apply Amplitude's statistical methodologies to experiment analysis
4. Visualize results using Amplitude's charting capabilities

## Technical Functions and APIs

The product includes a robust Formula Metrics engine with specialized functions:

- `UNIQUES(event_name)`: Counts unique users who performed a specific event
- `TOTALS(event_name)`: Counts total occurrences of a specific event
- `PROPSUM(event_name, property_name)`: Sums values of a property across events
- `PROPAVG(event_name, property_name)`: Calculates average value of a property across events
- `PROPCOUNT(event_name, property_name)`: Counts occurrences of a property with specific values
- `PROPMAX(event_name, property_name)`: Returns maximum value of a property
- `PROPMIN(event_name, property_name)`: Returns minimum value of a property
- `CONVERSIONRATE(funnel_name)`: Returns conversion rate for a funnel
- `CONVERSIONAVG(funnel_name)`: Returns average conversion time for a funnel
- `REVENUETOTAL(event_name)`: Calculates total revenue from an event

The workflow for using Experiment Results involves:
1. Defining exposure events that identify experiment participants
2. Selecting metrics to track
3. Configuring statistical settings
4. Defining experiment variants
5. Analyzing results through the four chart types (Confidence Interval, Cumulative Exposure, Performance by Variant, and Mean Over Time)

The product automatically calculates statistical significance for all metrics, including custom formula metrics, ensuring statistical rigor in experiment analysis through variance calculation, mean calculation, confidence interval determination, and p-value calculation.
