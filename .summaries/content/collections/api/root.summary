# Amplitude API Suite

## Product Overview

Amplitude is a digital analytics platform that provides tools for tracking, analyzing, and optimizing user behavior across digital products. The API suite enables programmatic access to Amplitude's features, allowing developers to integrate data collection, user management, and analytics capabilities into their applications and workflows.

Key features of the Amplitude API suite include:
- Event tracking and ingestion via HTTP APIs
- User identity management and property updates
- Data export and retrieval capabilities
- Cohort management and behavioral analysis
- Dashboard and analytics data access
- Privacy compliance and user data management
- Event schema and taxonomy management
- Cross-project user mapping

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Amplitude API suite consists of several interconnected APIs that serve different purposes within the analytics ecosystem:

1. **Data Ingestion APIs**:
   - HTTP V2 API: Core API for sending event data to Amplitude
   - Batch Event Upload API: For uploading large volumes of event data
   - Identify API: For updating user properties without sending events
   - Group Identify API: For setting properties on groups of users
   - Attribution API: For sending attribution campaign events

2. **Data Retrieval APIs**:
   - Export API: For retrieving raw event data
   - Dashboard REST API: For accessing analytics data from dashboards
   - User Profile API: For retrieving user properties and recommendations

3. **User Management APIs**:
   - User Mapping (Aliasing) API: For mapping user IDs across projects
   - User Privacy API: For GDPR/CCPA compliance and data deletion
   - SCIM API: For user provisioning and permission management

4. **Analytics Enhancement APIs**:
   - Behavioral Cohorts API: For managing user cohorts
   - Chart Annotations API: For adding context to analytics charts
   - Releases API: For tracking product releases
   - Lookup Table API: For property augmentation and mapping
   - Taxonomy API: For managing event schema

5. **Operational APIs**:
   - Event Streaming Metrics API: For monitoring event delivery
   - CCPA DSAR API: For data subject access requests

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **device_id**: A unique identifier for a device or browser instance
- **user_id**: A unique identifier for a user, which can be assigned to multiple device_ids
- **event_type**: The name of an event being tracked
- **user_properties**: Attributes associated with a user
- **event_properties**: Attributes associated with a specific event
- **group_type/group_value**: Identifiers for grouping users (e.g., by organization)
- **insert_id**: A unique identifier for an event used for deduplication
- **amplitude_id**: Amplitude's internal user identifier
- **global_user_id**: An identifier used to map users across projects
- **cohort**: A group of users who share common behaviors or attributes
- **lookup table**: A mapping of existing properties to new properties

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's API suite integrates with the broader Amplitude product ecosystem in several ways:

1. **Data Collection and Processing**:
   - The HTTP V2 API and Batch Event Upload API feed data into Amplitude's analytics engine
   - The Identify and Group Identify APIs update user and group properties
   - The Attribution API connects marketing campaign data with user behavior

2. **Analytics and Visualization**:
   - The Dashboard REST API exposes data from Amplitude's visualization tools
   - The Chart Annotations API enhances charts with contextual information
   - The Releases API connects product releases to analytics data

3. **User Management and Privacy**:
   - The User Privacy API implements data deletion for compliance
   - The SCIM API connects with identity providers for user management
   - The User Mapping API enables cross-project analysis

4. **Data Enhancement**:
   - The Lookup Table API augments properties without requiring formulas
   - The Taxonomy API manages the event schema for better data organization
   - The Behavioral Cohorts API enables advanced user segmentation
