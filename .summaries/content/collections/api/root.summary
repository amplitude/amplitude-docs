# Amplitude Analytics API Suite

Amplitude provides a comprehensive suite of REST APIs for analytics data ingestion, user management, data export, and platform configuration. The API ecosystem centers around event-driven analytics with robust user identification, property management, and data governance capabilities.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

### Core Data Ingestion APIs
The **HTTP V2 API** (`/2/httpapi`) serves as the primary event ingestion endpoint, supporting real-time event streaming with rate limiting of 1000 events/second per device/user ID. The **Batch Event Upload API** extends this capability for bulk operations with 20MB payload limits. Both APIs share the same event schema and support user property operations (`$set`, `$setOnce`, `$add`, `$append`, `$unset`) and group property management.

The **Identify API** (`/identify`) and **Group Identify API** (`/groupidentify`) complement event ingestion by enabling property updates without sending events, supporting user-device ID mapping and group property management for the Accounts add-on.

### Data Export and Access APIs
The **Export API** (`/api/2/export`) provides bulk event data extraction in zipped JSON format with 4GB limits and 365-day query periods. The **Dashboard REST API** offers structured access to analytics results including event segmentation, funnel analysis, retention metrics, and revenue analytics. The **User Profile API** (`profile-api.amplitude.com/v1/userprofile`) delivers enriched user profiles with computed properties, cohort memberships, and ML-driven recommendations.

### User Management and Privacy
The **User Privacy API** (`/api/2/deletions/users`) handles GDPR/CCPA compliance through programmatic user data deletion with 30-day processing timelines. The **User Mapping API** (`/usermap`) enables cross-project user identity resolution via the Portfolio add-on. The **SCIM 2.0 API** provides enterprise user provisioning and group management with Identity Provider integration.

### Configuration and Metadata APIs
The **Taxonomy API** (Enterprise-only) manages event schema including categories, event types, and property definitions with Data Access Controls. The **Lookup Table API v3** (`/api/3/lookup_table`) enables CSV-based property augmentation with 100MB/1M row limits. The **Releases API** (`/api/2/release`) supports deployment workflow integration through programmatic release tracking.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### User Identification
- **amplitude_id**: Amplitude's internal user identifier
- **user_id**: Customer-defined user identifier
- **device_id**: Device-specific identifier
- **global_user_id**: Cross-project user identifier (Portfolio add-on)

### Event Structure
- **event_type**: Event name/category
- **event_properties**: Event-specific attributes
- **user_properties**: User-level attributes
- **group_properties**: Account/organization-level attributes (Accounts add-on)
- **insert_id**: Deduplication identifier
- **session_id**: Session tracking identifier

### Property Operations
- **$set**: Set property value
- **$setOnce**: Set only if not previously set
- **$add**: Increment numeric values
- **$append/$prepend**: Array manipulation
- **$unset**: Remove property
- **$identify**: User property update event
- **$groupidentify**: Group property update event

### API Infrastructure
- **Rate Limiting**: Varies by endpoint (1000 events/sec, 1800 user properties/hour, 100 SCIM requests/minute)
- **Authentication**: HTTP Basic Auth, API keys, secret keys, scim_key
- **Endpoints**: Primary (`api2.amplitude.com`), EU (`api.eu.amplitude.com`), specialized (`profile-api`, `data-api`)

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

### Analytics Platform Integration
The APIs integrate with Amplitude's core analytics platform through standardized event schemas and user identification systems. The **Attribution API** connects advertising campaign data via platform-specific identifiers (idfa, idfv, adid, android_app_set_id) with 72-hour matching windows.

### Enterprise Features
Enterprise capabilities include the **Taxonomy API** for schema governance, **Behavioral Cohorts API** with 2M user limits, advanced **User Privacy** controls, and **SCIM** integration for identity management. The **Accounts add-on** enables B2B analytics through group properties and multi-level user organization.

### Data Pipeline Integration
**Event Streaming Metrics API** monitors delivery performance across streaming destinations with latency and success rate tracking. The **Lookup Table API** enables data enrichment through CSV uploads, while **Export APIs** support data warehouse integration and custom analytics workflows.

### Development Workflow Integration
The **Releases API** connects deployment pipelines to analytics tracking, while **Chart Annotations API** enables programmatic documentation of significant events. Multiple programming language examples (cURL, JavaScript, Python, Java, Go, Ruby) support diverse development environments.

## Key API Endpoints and Operations

- `POST /2/httpapi` - Real-time event ingestion
- `POST /batch` - Bulk event upload
- `POST /identify` - User property updates
- `POST /groupidentify` - Group property management
- `GET /api/2/export` - Event data export
- `POST /api/2/deletions/users` - User data deletion
- `GET /profile-api.amplitude.com/v1/userprofile` - User profile retrieval
