# Amplitude Analytics API Platform

Amplitude provides a comprehensive REST API ecosystem for analytics data management, offering real-time event ingestion, user identity management, data export capabilities, and enterprise-grade administration tools. The platform operates through multiple specialized API endpoints supporting both high-volume data operations and granular user management with robust authentication and compliance features.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

The Amplitude API ecosystem is structured around four core functional domains that work together to provide end-to-end analytics capabilities:

**Data Ingestion Layer**: The HTTP V2 API (`api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`) and Batch Event Upload API form the primary data entry points, handling real-time and bulk event tracking respectively. The Attribution API extends this layer specifically for mobile advertising attribution, creating a comprehensive event capture system that feeds into Amplitude's analytics engine.

**Identity Management Layer**: The Identify API, Group Identify API, and User Mapping API work in concert to maintain user identity resolution across devices and projects. The User Mapping API requires the Portfolio add-on and enables cross-project identity linking through global_user_id mapping, while the Group Identify API supports account-level analytics through the Accounts add-on.

**Data Access Layer**: The Export API, Dashboard REST API, and User Profile API provide different levels of data retrieval - from bulk raw event exports to processed analytics insights to individual user profiles. These APIs serve different use cases from data warehousing to real-time personalization.

**Administration and Compliance Layer**: The Taxonomy API, SCIM 2.0 API, User Privacy API, and CCPA DSAR API provide enterprise governance capabilities, ensuring data quality, user provisioning, and regulatory compliance across the platform.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Event Ingestion Concepts**:
- `insert_id`: Unique identifier for event deduplication across ingestion APIs
- `user_id` and `device_id`: Primary user identification mechanisms with automatic mapping
- `global_user_id`: Cross-project user identifier enabled through Portfolio add-on
- `attribution_window`: 72-hour window for mobile advertising attribution matching

**User Property Operations**:
- `$set`, `$setOnce`, `$add`, `$append`, `$prepend`, `$unset`: Standard user property modification operations
- `user_properties`, `event_properties`, `group_properties`: Three-tier property classification system

**Group Analytics**:
- Up to 5 unique `group_types` supported per project
- Group-level analytics requiring Accounts add-on
- 1024 group identifies limit per request

**Data Export Specifications**:
- `sync_id`: Parameter for tracking event streaming delivery metrics
- Pre-signed S3 URLs for large file transfers (cohorts, exports)
- UTC timestamps in milliseconds since epoch as standard time format

**Compliance and Privacy**:
- GDPR/CCPA deletion workflows with 30-day scheduling
- DSAR (Data Subject Access Request) processing with 3-day SLA
- PII, SENSITIVE, REVENUE property classifications in Taxonomy API

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The API platform integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem through several key mechanisms:

**Plan-Based Feature Access**: APIs are tiered across Amplitude's pricing plans - Taxonomy API requires Enterprise, User Profile API requires Activation plan, and Behavioral Cohorts API requires Growth Enterprise, creating a natural upgrade path for advanced functionality.

**Add-on Product Integration**: The Portfolio add-on enables cross-project user mapping, while the Accounts add-on unlocks group-level analytics, demonstrating how APIs extend core platform capabilities.

**Third-Party Integration Points**: SCIM 2.0 API enables Identity Provider integration, Event Streaming Metrics API supports external data pipeline monitoring, and the Attribution API connects with mobile advertising platforms for campaign tracking.

**Data Pipeline Architecture**: The platform supports both real-time (individual events) and batch processing (bulk uploads, exports) workflows, with APIs designed to handle different stages of the analytics data lifecycle from ingestion to analysis to action.

## API Endpoints and Technical Specifications
