# Amplitude API Suite

## Product Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive analytics and data platform that helps organizations understand user behavior, track events, manage user data, and derive insights from digital interactions. The API suite provides programmatic access to Amplitude's core functionalities, enabling developers to integrate Amplitude's analytics capabilities into their workflows, applications, and data pipelines.

Key features include event ingestion and tracking, user identity management, data export and retrieval, cohort management, dashboard access, privacy compliance, schema management, and cross-project user mapping. The platform serves use cases spanning product analytics, user behavior tracking, marketing attribution, privacy compliance, and data ecosystem integration.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Amplitude API suite consists of four interconnected API categories:

1. **Data Ingestion APIs**:
   - HTTP V2 API: Primary method for sending event data
   - Batch Event Upload API: For historical data uploads
   - Identify API: Updates user properties without events
   - Group Identify API: Sets properties on groups (requires Accounts add-on)
   - Attribution API: Tracks marketing campaign attribution

2. **Data Retrieval APIs**:
   - Export API: Extracts raw event data
   - Dashboard REST API: Accesses processed analytics data
   - User Profile API: Retrieves user properties and recommendations
   - Behavioral Cohorts API: Works with user segments

3. **Data Management APIs**:
   - Taxonomy API: Manages event schema
   - Lookup Table API: Handles property augmentation
   - User Mapping API: Enables cross-project identity resolution
   - User Privacy API: Supports GDPR/CCPA compliance

4. **Operational APIs**:
   - SCIM API: Manages user provisioning and access
   - Releases API: Documents product releases
   - Chart Annotations API: Marks significant events on charts
   - Event Streaming Metrics API: Monitors data delivery

These APIs form a complete workflow where data flows from ingestion through processing to retrieval and management.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: A discrete user action containing properties and identifiers
- **device_id**: Unique identifier for a device or browser instance
- **user_id**: Unique identifier for a user (can map to multiple device_ids)
- **amplitude_id**: Amplitude's internal user identifier
- **event_type**: Name/category of a tracked event
- **event_properties**: Key-value pairs providing context about an event
- **user_properties**: Persistent attributes associated with a user
- **group_properties**: Attributes associated with a group (account/organization)
- **insert_id**: Unique identifier for event deduplication
- **cohort**: User segment defined by behavioral criteria
- **lookup table**: Mapping of existing property values to new values
- **taxonomy**: Schema definition for events, properties, and metadata

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's API suite integrates with the broader data ecosystem through:

1. **Data Collection Integration**: HTTP APIs accept data from:
   - Client-side applications (web, mobile)
   - Server-side systems
   - Data pipelines and ETL processes
   - Third-party tools via webhooks

2. **Identity Resolution**: User Mapping API enables cross-project/platform identity resolution

3. **Data Activation**: User Profile and Behavioral Cohorts APIs make user data and segments available to other systems

4. **Enterprise Systems Integration**: SCIM API integrates with identity providers (Okta, JumpCloud)

5. **Privacy Compliance**: User Privacy API and CCPA DSAR API support privacy management systems

6. **Data Residency**: Dedicated API endpoints for European customers (EU data residency)
