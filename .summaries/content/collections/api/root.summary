# Amplitude API Suite

## Product Overview

Amplitude provides a comprehensive suite of APIs for analytics, user management, and data integration. The platform enables businesses to track user behavior, manage user data, create cohorts, and integrate analytics into their applications. Key features include event tracking, user identification, data export, behavioral cohort management, and privacy compliance tools.

The Amplitude API ecosystem supports various analytics workflows including:
- Event ingestion through HTTP APIs
- User and group property management
- Data export and integration
- Cross-project user mapping
- Privacy compliance and data subject access requests
- Dashboard and chart data retrieval
- Event schema management

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Amplitude API suite consists of several interconnected components:

1. **Data Ingestion APIs**:
   - HTTP V2 API: Core event tracking API for sending analytics data
   - Batch Event Upload API: For uploading large volumes of events (up to 20MB)
   - Identify API: For updating user properties without sending events
   - Group Identify API: For setting properties on groups of users

2. **Data Management APIs**:
   - User Mapping (Aliasing) API: Links user IDs across projects
   - Taxonomy API: Manages event schema definitions
   - Lookup Table API: Augments properties through CSV mappings
   - User Privacy API: Handles user data deletion requests
   - CCPA DSAR API: Retrieves user data for compliance purposes

3. **Data Retrieval APIs**:
   - Export API: Extracts raw event data
   - Dashboard REST API: Retrieves analyzed data from dashboards
   - User Profile API: Accesses user properties and recommendations
   - Behavioral Cohorts API: Manages user segments

4. **Visualization and Annotation APIs**:
   - Chart Annotations API: Marks significant events on charts
   - Releases API: Documents product releases on charts

5. **Integration APIs**:
   - SCIM API: Manages user provisioning with identity providers
   - Event Streaming Metrics API: Monitors event delivery to third-party destinations

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **device_id**: Unique identifier for a device or browser
- **user_id**: Custom identifier for a user, typically from your authentication system
- **amplitude_id**: Amplitude's internal user identifier
- **event_type**: Name of the tracked user action
- **user_properties**: Attributes associated with users
- **event_properties**: Attributes associated with specific events
- **group_type/group_value**: Identifiers for account-level analytics
- **insert_id**: Unique identifier for event deduplication
- **cohort**: A segment of users defined by behavioral criteria
- **lookup table**: Mapping between existing properties and new properties
- **taxonomy**: The schema definition for events and properties

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's APIs integrate with the broader Amplitude product ecosystem:

1. **Analytics Platform**: The HTTP APIs feed data into Amplitude's analytics engine, which processes and stores events for analysis.

2. **Dashboard and Visualization**: The Dashboard REST API and Chart Annotations API connect with Amplitude's visualization tools.

3. **Data Activation**: The User Profile API enables personalization and targeting based on analytics data.

4. **Cross-Project Analytics**: The User Mapping API enables the Portfolio add-on for cross-project analysis.

5. **Identity Management**: The SCIM API integrates with identity providers like Okta and JumpCloud.

6. **Privacy Compliance**: The User Privacy API and CCPA DSAR API support compliance workflows.

7. **Data Destinations**: The Event Streaming Metrics API monitors data flowing to integrated third-party systems.
