## Amplitude Analytics API Suite

Amplitude offers a comprehensive REST API ecosystem for analytics data management, providing real-time event ingestion, user behavior analysis, and enterprise-grade data governance capabilities. The platform operates with dual regional infrastructure supporting both standard (`api2.amplitude.com`) and EU-specific endpoints (`api.eu.amplitude.com`) for data residency compliance.

## Core Product Architecture and Relationships

The API suite is structured around three primary data flow patterns: **ingestion**, **analysis**, and **export**. The ingestion layer centers on the HTTP V2 API (`/2/httpapi`) as the primary real-time event streaming endpoint, complemented by the Batch Event Upload API for bulk operations. These feed into Amplitude's analytics engine, which powers the Dashboard REST API for programmatic access to segmentation, funnel, and retention analytics. The Export API completes the cycle by enabling bulk data extraction in zipped JSON format.

User identity management operates through a parallel system where the Identify API manages individual user properties, the Group Identify API handles organizational-level attributes, and the User Mapping API (Portfolio add-on) enables cross-project identity resolution. The User Profile API synthesizes this data into comprehensive profiles including computed properties, cohort memberships, and ML-driven predictions.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** represent user actions with structured properties, ingested at up to 1000 events/second per device/user ID through the HTTP V2 API with 1MB/2000 event payload limits. **User Properties** are managed through identify operations supporting standard operations: `$set` (assign), `$setOnce` (assign if null), `$add` (increment), `$append`/`$prepend` (array manipulation), and `$unset` (remove).

**Groups** enable organizational analytics with support for up to 5 unique group types and 10 total groups per event. **Cohorts** represent user segments managed through the Behavioral Cohorts API (v3/v5) with asynchronous three-step operations (request → poll → download) supporting up to 2 million users per cohort.

**Attribution** data processes advertising identifiers (idfa, idfv, adid, android_app_set_id) with a 72-hour matching window. **Taxonomy** (Enterprise-only) provides event schema governance with classifications for PII, SENSITIVE, and REVENUE data types.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The API suite integrates with enterprise workflows through multiple touchpoints. The SCIM 2.0 API enables automated user provisioning with Identity Providers (Okta, JumpCloud) at 100 requests per minute. The Releases API (`/api/2/release`) connects deployment pipelines for product release tracking, while Chart Annotations API (`/api/2/annotations`) supports operational monitoring through programmatic annotation creation.

Privacy compliance operates through dedicated endpoints: the User Privacy API (`/api/2/deletions/users`) handles GDPR/CCPA deletion requests with 30-day processing timelines, while the CCPA DSAR API manages data subject access requests with 3-day SLA and 14.4K cost per hour rate limits.

The Event Streaming Metrics API provides observability for real-time data pipelines, monitoring delivery latency, success rates, and failure tracking with 90-day retention. The Lookup Table API v3 (`data-api.amplitude.com/api/3/lookup_table`) enables property augmentation through CSV uploads with 100MB file and 1,000,000 row limits.

## Critical API Endpoints and Technical Specifications

**Primary Ingestion Endpoints:**
- `POST api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi` - Real-time event streaming
- `POST api2.amplitude.com/batch` - Bulk event upload (20MB limit)
- `POST api2.amplitude.com/identify` - User property management
- `POST api2.amplitude.com/groupidentify` - Group property management

**Analytics and Export Endpoints:**
- `GET analytics.amplitude.com/api/2/events/segmentation` - Event segmentation analysis
- `GET analytics.amplitude.com/api/2/funnels` - Funnel analysis
- `GET amplitude.com/api/2/export` - Bulk data export (4GB limit, YYYYMMDDTHH format)

The platform employs HTTP Basic authentication across most endpoints, with rate limiting varying by function: 1000 events/second for ingestion, 1800 user property updates/hour for identification, and 5 concurrent requests for dashboard analytics. Error handling follows standard HTTP status codes with specific handling for 429 (rate limiting) and 413 (payload size exceeded).
