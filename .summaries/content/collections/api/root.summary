# Amplitude Analytics API Suite

Amplitude provides a comprehensive suite of REST APIs for analytics data ingestion, user management, data export, and privacy compliance. The platform serves as a product analytics solution with robust server-side integration capabilities, supporting both real-time event tracking and batch data operations.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The API ecosystem is organized around several core functional areas:

**Data Ingestion Layer:**
- **HTTP V2 API** (`/2/httpapi`) serves as the primary event ingestion endpoint, supporting real-time server-side event tracking with comprehensive field specifications
- **Batch Event Upload API** (`/batch`) handles large-scale data uploads up to 20MB with rate limiting of 1000 events per second per device/user ID
- **Identify API** (`/identify`) manages user property updates and Device ID to User ID mappings without generating events
- **Group Identify API** (`/groupidentify`) handles group-level property management for account-based analytics
- **Attribution API** (`/attribution`) processes attribution campaign events using advertising identifiers (idfa, idfv, adid, android_app_set_id)

**Data Access and Export Layer:**
- **Export API** (`/api/2/export`) provides bulk event data export in zipped JSON format with 4GB size limits
- **Dashboard REST API** offers structured access to analytics data including user metrics, funnels, retention, and revenue analytics
- **User Profile API** (`profile-api.amplitude.com/v1/userprofile`) retrieves comprehensive user profiles including computed properties and predictions

**User and Privacy Management:**
- **User Privacy API** (`/api/2/deletions/users`) handles GDPR/CCPA compliance through programmatic user data deletion
- **CCPA DSAR API** provides Data Subject Access Request functionality with asynchronous processing
- **User Mapping API** (`/usermap`) enables cross-project user identity resolution through the Portfolio add-on
- **SCIM 2.0 API** supports enterprise user provisioning and group management

**Configuration and Metadata Management:**
- **Taxonomy API** (Enterprise) provides programmatic event schema management including categories, event types, and properties
- **Behavioral Cohorts API** (v3/v5) manages user cohort operations with asynchronous download capabilities
- **Lookup Table API** (v1/v2) enables CSV-based property augmentation through static data mappings
- **Chart Annotations API** (`/api/2/annotations`) supports programmatic chart annotation management
- **Releases API** (`/api/2/release`) integrates deployment workflows with product release tracking

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Identifiers:**
- `amplitude_id`: Internal Amplitude user identifier
- `user_id`: Customer-defined user identifier
- `device_id`: Device-specific identifier
- `session_id`: Session tracking identifier
- `insert_id`: Event deduplication identifier

**Event Structure:**
- `event_type`: Classification of user action
- `event_properties`: Event-specific metadata
- `user_properties`: User-level attributes
- `group_properties`: Account/organization-level attributes (Accounts add-on)

**Property Operations:**
- `$set`, `$setOnce`, `$add`, `$append`, `$prepend`, `$unset`, `$preInsert`, `$postInsert`, `$remove`: User property manipulation operations

**API Infrastructure:**
- Primary endpoint: `api2.amplitude.com`
- EU residency endpoint: `api.eu.amplitude.com`
- Profile API: `profile-api.amplitude.com`
- Data API: `data-api.amplitude.com`

**Rate Limiting and Throttling:**
- Standard rate limits with 429 response codes
- Cost-per-query model for certain endpoints
- Concurrent request limits (typically 5 requests)
- Device/user-specific throttling mechanisms

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The API suite integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics platform through several key mechanisms:

**Plan-Based Feature Access:**
- Growth and Enterprise plans unlock advanced features like Behavioral Cohorts API
- Portfolio add-on enables cross-project user mapping
- Accounts add-on provides group-level analytics capabilities
- Activation plan required for User Profile API access

**Authentication Patterns:**
- HTTP Basic Authentication using API keys for most endpoints
- Secret key authentication for sensitive operations like User Profile API
- SCIM-specific authentication using `scim_key`
- Organization-level API keys for admin operations

**Data Flow Architecture:**
The platform follows a hub-and-spoke model where:
- Ingestion APIs feed the central event store
- Export APIs provide data egress capabilities
- Management APIs control metadata and configuration
- Privacy APIs ensure compliance across all data stores

**Integration Points:**
- Identity Provider integration through SCIM 2.0
- Amazon S3 integration for large file operations
- Webhook and streaming integrations for real-time data delivery
- Cross-project data sharing through Portfolio features

**Operational Considerations:**
- Asynchronous processing patterns for large operations (cohort downloads, DSAR requests)
- Polling mechanisms for long-running operations using `request_id`
- Comprehensive error handling with specific HTTP status codes
- Data retention policies (90-day limits for streaming metrics, 365-day limits for exports)

The API ecosystem supports both real-time analytics use cases and batch processing workflows, with robust enterprise features for compliance, user management, and cross-project analytics coordination.
