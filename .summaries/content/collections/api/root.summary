# Amplitude Analytics API Suite

Amplitude offers a comprehensive REST API ecosystem for analytics data management, providing enterprise-grade capabilities for event ingestion, user management, data export, and platform configuration. The platform supports both real-time streaming and batch processing workflows with robust privacy compliance and cross-project analytics features.

## Core Architecture and Data Flow

The API suite centers around event-driven analytics with a clear separation between data ingestion, processing, and export layers. The **HTTP V2 API** (`/2/httpapi`) serves as the primary real-time ingestion endpoint, while the **Batch Event Upload API** (`/batch`) handles large-scale data processing with 20MB payload limits and 1000 events/second rate limiting. Data flows through Amplitude's processing pipeline before becoming available through various export and analytics endpoints.

The platform maintains strict user identity management through dedicated APIs - the **Identify API** (`/identify`) manages User ID to Device ID mappings without triggering events, while the **Group Identify API** (`/groupidentify`) extends this to group-level properties supporting up to 5 unique group types per event.

## Key Product Relationships and Feature Integration

### Data Ingestion Layer
- **HTTP V2 API**: Real-time event streaming with comprehensive field specifications (event_type, user_properties, group_properties, revenue tracking)
- **Batch Event Upload API**: Large-scale ingestion with JSON payloads and rate limiting
- **Attribution API**: Advertising attribution processing using platform identifiers (idfa, idfv, adid, android_app_set_id) with 72-hour matching windows

### Analytics and Export Layer  
- **Dashboard REST API**: Programmatic access to core analytics (event segmentation, funnel analysis, retention analysis, revenue analytics)
- **Export API** (`/api/2/export`): Bulk event data extraction in zipped JSON format with 4GB limits and 365-day maximum query periods
- **User Profile API** (`profile-api.amplitude.com/v1/userprofile`): Comprehensive user profiles including computed properties, cohort memberships, and prediction propensities

### Enterprise Management Layer
- **Taxonomy API**: Event schema management with CRUD operations for categories, event types, and property classifications (PII, SENSITIVE, REVENUE)
- **SCIM 2.0 API**: Automated user provisioning with Identity Provider integrations (Okta, JumpCloud)
- **User Mapping API** (`/usermap`): Cross-project identity resolution through Portfolio add-on

## Critical Nomenclature and Definitions

**Event Types**: Categorized user actions tracked through the platform with standardized naming conventions
**User Properties**: Persistent attributes associated with individual users, managed through $set, $setOnce, $add, $append, $prepend, $unset operations
**Group Properties**: Attributes applied to user groups, supporting up to 10 total groups per event
**Global User ID**: Cross-project identifier enabling user identity resolution across multiple Amplitude projects
**Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments with behavioral or demographic criteria, managed through v3/v5 APIs with 2 million user limits
**Lookup Tables**: CSV-based property augmentation supporting 100MB files and 1,000,000 rows
**Sync ID**: Tracking identifier for streaming destination delivery monitoring with 90-day retention
**Cost-per-query**: Rate limiting model based on computational resource consumption rather than simple request counts

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The API suite integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics platform through several key touchpoints:

**Data Governance**: The Taxonomy API connects with Data Access Controls for enterprise-grade schema management and PII classification
**Privacy Compliance**: Dedicated **User Privacy API** (`/api/2/deletions/users`) and **CCPA DSAR API** handle GDPR/CCPA requirements with 30-day processing timelines
**Cross-Project Analytics**: The Portfolio add-on enables global user identity resolution through the User Mapping API
**Streaming Infrastructure**: **Event Streaming Metrics API** provides delivery monitoring for real-time destinations with latency and success rate tracking
**Release Management**: **Releases API** (`/api/2/release`) integrates deployment workflows with chart annotations

Authentication follows HTTP Basic patterns with API keys or secret keys depending on endpoint requirements. EU data residency is supported through dedicated endpoints (api.eu.amplitude.com) for applicable services. Rate limiting varies by API with common patterns including concurrent request limits (typically 5), per-second throttling, and cost-per-query models for resource-intensive operations.
