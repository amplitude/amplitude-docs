# Amplitude API Suite

## Product Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive analytics and data platform that helps businesses track user behavior, analyze product usage, and make data-driven decisions. The Amplitude API suite provides programmatic access to the platform's features, enabling developers to integrate Amplitude's analytics capabilities into their workflows, applications, and systems.

Key features of the Amplitude API suite include:
- Event tracking and management for capturing user behavior
- User identity and profile management
- Data export and analysis capabilities
- Schema and taxonomy management
- Privacy and compliance tools
- Integration features for connecting with other systems

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Amplitude API suite consists of several interconnected APIs organized in layers:

### Data Ingestion Layer
- **HTTP V2 API**: Primary endpoint for sending event data to Amplitude
- **Batch Event Upload API**: For uploading large volumes of events in a single request
- **Identify API**: For setting user properties without sending events
- **Group Identify API**: For setting properties on groups of users
- **Attribution API**: For tracking marketing attribution data

### Data Management Layer
- **Taxonomy API**: For managing event schemas and property classifications
- **Lookup Table API**: For augmenting properties with additional data
- **User Mapping API**: For connecting user identities across projects
- **User Privacy API**: For handling data deletion requests

### Data Access Layer
- **Export API**: For retrieving raw event data
- **Dashboard REST API**: For accessing analytics data from dashboards
- **Behavioral Cohorts API**: For working with user segments
- **User Profile API**: For accessing user properties and recommendations
- **CCPA DSAR API**: For retrieving all data associated with a user

### Auxiliary Features
- **Chart Annotations API**: For marking significant events on charts
- **Releases API**: For tracking product releases
- **Event Streaming Metrics API**: For monitoring event delivery
- **SCIM API**: For user and group provisioning

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: A user action or occurrence tracked in Amplitude (identified by `event_type`)
- **User ID**: A unique identifier for a user (`user_id`)
- **Device ID**: A unique identifier for a device (`device_id`)
- **Amplitude ID**: Amplitude's internal user identifier
- **Properties**:
  - **Event Properties**: Attributes associated with a specific event
  - **User Properties**: Attributes associated with a user
  - **Group Properties**: Attributes associated with a group of users
- **Cohort**: A segment of users defined by specific behaviors or properties
- **Lookup Table**: A mapping of existing properties to new properties
- **Taxonomy**: The schema and classification of events and properties
- **DSAR**: Data Subject Access Request (for privacy compliance)
- **Attribution**: Tracking which marketing campaigns led to user actions

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's API suite integrates with the broader Amplitude product ecosystem:

1. **Amplitude Analytics**: The core analytics platform that processes and visualizes event data
2. **Amplitude Experiment**: For A/B testing and feature flagging
3. **Amplitude CDP**: For customer data management
4. **Amplitude Recommend**: For personalization and recommendations

The APIs enable bidirectional data flow between these products and external systems, allowing for:
- Integration with marketing automation platforms
- Connection to data warehouses and business intelligence tools
- Incorporation into CI/CD pipelines for release tracking
- Synchronization with identity providers via SCIM
- Custom application development using Amplitude data
