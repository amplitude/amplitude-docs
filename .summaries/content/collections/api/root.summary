## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Amplitude API suite consists of several interconnected APIs that work together to provide a complete analytics solution:

1. **Data Ingestion APIs**:
   - HTTP V2 API: Primary method for sending event data to Amplitude
   - Batch Event Upload API: For uploading large volumes of events
   - Identify API: For updating user properties without sending events
   - Group Identify API: For setting properties on groups of users
   - Attribution API: For tracking marketing attribution data

2. **Data Retrieval APIs**:
   - Export API: For extracting raw event data
   - Dashboard REST API: For accessing chart and dashboard data
   - User Profile API: For retrieving user properties and recommendations
   - Behavioral Cohorts API: For accessing user segments

3. **Data Management APIs**:
   - Taxonomy API: For managing event schema
   - Lookup Table API: For property mapping and augmentation
   - User Mapping API: For cross-project user identification
   - User Privacy API: For compliance with privacy regulations
   - SCIM API: For user and permission management

4. **Annotation and Metadata APIs**:
   - Chart Annotations API: For marking significant events on charts
   - Releases API: For tracking product releases

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **device_id**: Unique identifier for a device or browser
- **user_id**: Unique identifier for a user, typically from your authentication system
- **event_type**: Name of the action being tracked
- **event properties**: Metadata associated with a specific event
- **user properties**: Attributes associated with a user that persist across events
- **group properties**: Attributes associated with a group of users (requires Accounts add-on)
- **insert_id**: Unique identifier for an event used for deduplication
- **amplitude_id**: Amplitude's internal user identifier
- **global_user_id**: Identifier used to map users across projects
- **cohort**: Segment of users defined by behavioral criteria
- **lookup table**: Mapping of existing properties to new properties for data enrichment
- **taxonomy**: Schema definition for events, properties, and their metadata

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's API suite integrates with the broader Amplitude product ecosystem in several ways:

1. **Cross-Project Views**: The User Mapping API enables the Portfolio add-on functionality, allowing businesses to track users across multiple projects.

2. **Accounts Add-on**: The Group Identify API supports the Accounts add-on, enabling account-level reporting and analysis.

3. **Activation Plan**: The User Profile API requires an Activation plan and provides access to computed properties, cohort memberships, and recommendations.

4. **Enterprise Features**: The Taxonomy API is available to Enterprise customers for programmatic schema management.

5. **Data Residency**: The HTTP API supports EU data residency through different endpoints (api.eu.amplitude.com).
