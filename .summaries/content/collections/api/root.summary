# Amplitude API Platform

Amplitude provides a comprehensive suite of REST APIs for analytics data ingestion, user management, data export, and platform configuration. The platform supports both real-time event streaming and batch processing workflows, with enterprise-grade features for data governance, user privacy compliance, and cross-project analytics.

## Core Data Ingestion APIs

The platform's primary data ingestion capabilities center around the **HTTP V2 API** (`/2/httpapi` endpoint), which serves as the main server-to-server event ingestion mechanism. This API handles individual events with comprehensive payload validation, supporting user_id/device_id identification, event_type classification, and nested property structures for events, users, and groups.

For high-volume scenarios, the **Batch Event Upload API** (`/batch` endpoint) processes up to 20MB JSON payloads containing event arrays, with rate limiting of 1000 events per second per device/user ID. Both APIs support insert_id deduplication, session tracking, and revenue attribution fields.

Specialized ingestion includes the **Attribution API** (`/attribution` endpoint) for mobile advertising attribution using IDFA, IDFV, ADID, and android_app_set_id identifiers, with a 72-hour attribution window for campaign matching.

## User and Group Management

The **Identify API** (`/identify` endpoint) manages user properties without sending events, supporting operations like $set, $setOnce, $add, $append, $prepend, $unset, $preInsert, $postInsert, and $remove. The **Group Identify API** (`/groupidentify` endpoint) provides parallel functionality for group-level analytics through the Accounts add-on, supporting up to 5 unique group types with 1024 group identifies per request.

The **User Mapping API** (`/usermap` endpoint) enables cross-project user identity resolution through the Portfolio add-on, mapping local user_ids to global_user_ids with batch processing capabilities (2000 requests per batch, 50 events/second rate limit).

## Data Export and Analytics

The **Export API** (`/api/2/export`) provides raw event data extraction with date range queries, returning zipped JSON files up to 4GB containing complete event schemas including amplitude_id, user_properties, device information, and UTC timestamps. Data is available with a 2-hour delay and 365-day query limits.

The **Dashboard REST API** offers structured analytics data retrieval in JSON format, covering event segmentation, funnel analysis, retention analysis, session metrics, user activity tracking, and revenue LTV calculations. All endpoints use HTTP basic authentication with cost-per-query rate limiting models.

The **User Profile API** (`profile-api.amplitude.com/v1/userprofile`) retrieves comprehensive user profiles including computed properties, cohort memberships, recommendations, and prediction propensities, requiring Activation plan access and secret key authentication.

## Data Enhancement and Configuration

**Lookup Table APIs** (both v1 deprecated and v3 current at `data-api.amplitude.com/api/3/lookup_table`) enable CSV-based property augmentation through exact-match mappings, supporting up to 100MB files with 1,000,000 rows. The v3 API provides enhanced CRUD operations with incremental merge capabilities.

The **Taxonomy API** (Enterprise-only) manages event schema programmatically, providing CRUD operations for categories, event types, and properties with classifications (PII, SENSITIVE, REVENUE), validation rules, and Data Access Controls integration.

## Cohort and User Management

The **Behavioral Cohorts API** (v3/v5 endpoints at `/api/3/cohorts` and `/api/5/cohorts`) supports asynchronous cohort operations including download via S3 pre-signed URLs, upload by AMP_ID or USER_ID, and incremental membership updates with ADD/REMOVE operations. Rate limits include 500 requests per month with 5 concurrent requests and 2 million user maximum cohort sizes.

## Compliance and Privacy

The **User Privacy API** (`/api/2/deletions/users`) ensures GDPR/CCPA compliance through programmatic user data deletion, supporting batch processing of up to 100 users per request with 30-day deletion scheduling and job status tracking. The **CCPA DSAR API** provides comprehensive data subject access through asynchronous workflows, delivering gzipped JSON files within 3-day SLAs.

## Enterprise Features

**SCIM 2.0 API** integration enables automated user provisioning and group management for identity providers, supporting email-based user identification with 100 requests/minute rate limiting.

The **Releases API** (`/api/2/release`) integrates deployment workflows with analytics through programmatic release creation and chart annotation management.

## Key Nomenclature

- **amplitude_id**: Unique user identifier assigned by Amplitude
- **device_id/user_id**: Client-provided identifiers for user tracking
- **event_type**: Classification of user actions or system events
- **insert_id**: Deduplication identifier for event processing
- **group_type/group_value**: Account-level entity identification
- **sync_id**: Event streaming destination identifier
- **cohort_id**: User segment identifier
- **rec_id**: Recommendation engine identifier
- **API_KEY**: Project-level authentication token
- **secret_key**: Enhanced authentication for profile APIs

## Authentication and Rate Limiting

Most APIs use HTTP basic authentication with API keys, while specialized endpoints like User Profile API require secret keys. Rate limiting varies by endpoint, from 1 request/second for privacy operations to 1000 events/second for batch ingestion, with cost-per-query models for analytics endpoints and concurrent request limits for enterprise features.

The platform supports both US (api2.amplitude.com) and EU (api.eu.amplitude.com) data residency requirements, with some features like User Profile API currently unavailable in EU regions.
