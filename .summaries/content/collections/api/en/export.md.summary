# Summary
The Export API allows developers to retrieve event data from Amplitude projects with a GET request to `/api/2/export`, requiring start and end time parameters in YYYYMMDDTHH format. The API returns zipped JSON files with event data, has a 4GB size limit, and exports data based on server upload time with a minimum 2-hour delay.
