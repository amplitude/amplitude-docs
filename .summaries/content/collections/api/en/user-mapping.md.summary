# Summary
The User Mapping (Aliasing) API enables mapping different user IDs across projects to a global user ID, allowing accurate cross-project user counting while maintaining separate user properties for each original ID, with specific batch limits (2000 requests/batch, 1MB max) and rate limits (50 events/second).
