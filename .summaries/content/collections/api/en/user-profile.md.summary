**Summary:** The User Profile API retrieves Amplitude user profiles including user properties, computed user properties, cohort IDs, recommendations, and prediction propensities via GET requests to `https://profile-api.amplitude.com/v1/userprofile` using secret key authentication. This server-side only API requires an Activation plan, is unavailable in EU regions, and supports fetching recommendations by rec_id, user properties via get_amp_props, cohort memberships via get_cohort_ids, computations by comp_id, and prediction propensities by prediction_id.
