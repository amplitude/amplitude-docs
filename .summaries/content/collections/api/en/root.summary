## Amplitude Analytics API Suite

Amplitude provides a comprehensive suite of REST APIs for analytics data ingestion, user management, and data retrieval. The platform supports both standard and EU-specific endpoints with HTTP basic authentication as the primary authentication method across most APIs.

## Core Data Ingestion APIs

The **HTTP V2 API** serves as the primary event ingestion endpoint at `api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`, supporting real-time event streaming with rate limits of 1000 events/second per device/user ID and payload limits of 1MB/2000 events per request. For bulk operations, the **Batch Event Upload API** handles larger datasets up to 20MB with the same event schema but stricter rate limiting.

The **Identify API** (`/identify`) manages user properties without sending events, supporting operations like `$set`, `$setOnce`, `$add`, `$append`, `$prepend`, and `$unset` with rate limiting of 1800 updates per user per hour. The **Group Identify API** (`/groupidentify`) extends this functionality to group-level properties, supporting up to 5 unique group types and 10 total groups per event.

## Specialized Attribution and User Management

The **Attribution API** processes advertising attribution data using platform-specific identifiers (idfa, idfv, adid, android_app_set_id) with a 72-hour matching window. The **User Mapping API** enables cross-project user identity resolution through the Portfolio add-on, mapping different user IDs to global identifiers.

## Data Export and Analytics APIs

The **Export API** provides bulk event data extraction in zipped JSON format with YYYYMMDDTHH timestamp formatting and 4GB size limits. The **Dashboard REST API** offers programmatic access to analytics data including event segmentation, funnel analysis, retention metrics, and revenue analytics with concurrent limits of 5 requests.

The **User Profile API** (`profile-api.amplitude.com/v1/userprofile`) retrieves comprehensive user profiles including computed properties, cohort memberships, recommendations, and prediction propensities, requiring an Activation plan and unavailable in EU regions.

## Cohort and User Data Management

The **Behavioral Cohorts API** (v3/v5) manages user cohorts through asynchronous operations requiring three-step processes (request → poll status → download), supporting both `BY_AMP_ID` and `BY_USER_ID` operations with limits of 2 million users per cohort and 500 requests per month.

Privacy compliance is handled through the **User Privacy API** (`/api/2/deletions/users`) for GDPR/CCPA user data deletion with 30-day processing timelines, and the **CCPA DSAR API** for data subject access requests with 3-day SLA and rate limits of 14.4K cost per hour.

## Configuration and Metadata APIs

The **Taxonomy API** (Enterprise-only) provides comprehensive event schema management including CRUD operations for categories, event types, properties, and classifications (PII, SENSITIVE, REVENUE). The **Lookup Table API v3** (`data-api.amplitude.com/api/3/lookup_table`) manages CSV-based property augmentation with 100MB file limits and 1,000,000 row limits.

The **SCIM 2.0 API** enables automated user provisioning and group management with Identity Provider integration (Okta, JumpCloud) at 100 requests per minute. The **Releases API** (`/api/2/release`) supports deployment workflow integration for product release tracking.

## Monitoring and Annotations

The **Chart Annotations API** (`/api/2/annotations`) enables programmatic creation of date-based chart annotations supporting both global project-level and chart-specific annotations. The **Event Streaming Metrics API** provides delivery monitoring for event streams with metrics like latency, success rates, and failure tracking with 90-day retention.

## Key Technical Specifications

- **Authentication**: Primarily HTTP Basic authentication using API keys
- **Rate Limiting**: Varies by endpoint (1000 events/second for ingestion, 1800 user property updates/hour for Identify)
- **Payload Limits**: 1MB/2000 events (HTTP V2), 20MB (Batch), 100MB (Lookup Tables)
- **Regional Support**: Separate EU endpoints (`api.eu.amplitude.com`) for data residency compliance
- **Data Retention**: 90-day retention for streaming metrics, 365-day max query periods for exports
- **Error Handling**: Standard HTTP status codes with specific handling for 429 (rate limiting) and 413 (payload too large)

The API ecosystem supports both real-time and batch operations, with comprehensive user management, privacy compliance, and analytics capabilities designed for enterprise-scale implementations.
