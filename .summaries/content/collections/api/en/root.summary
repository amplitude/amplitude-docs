# Amplitude API Suite

## Product Overview

Amplitude provides a comprehensive suite of APIs for analytics, user management, and data integration. The platform enables businesses to track user behavior, manage user data, create cohorts, and integrate with other systems. Key features include event tracking, user identification, data export, privacy management, and behavioral analysis.

The Amplitude API ecosystem supports various use cases including:
- Sending event data to Amplitude servers
- Retrieving analytics data for dashboards and reports
- Managing user identities and properties
- Creating and analyzing user cohorts
- Ensuring compliance with privacy regulations
- Integrating with identity providers and other systems

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Amplitude API suite consists of several interconnected components:

1. **Data Ingestion APIs**:
   - HTTP V2 API: The primary method for sending event data to Amplitude
   - Batch Event Upload API: For uploading large volumes of events (up to 20MB)
   - Identify API: For updating user properties without sending events
   - Group Identify API: For setting properties on groups of users
   - Attribution API: For tracking attribution campaign events

2. **Data Retrieval APIs**:
   - Export API: For extracting raw event data
   - Dashboard REST API: For retrieving analyzed data from Amplitude dashboards
   - User Profile API: For accessing user properties and recommendations
   - Behavioral Cohorts API: For working with user segments

3. **Data Management APIs**:
   - User Privacy API: For GDPR/CCPA compliance and data deletion
   - User Mapping API: For connecting user identities across projects
   - Taxonomy API: For managing event schema
   - Lookup Table API: For property augmentation and mapping

4. **Integration and Enhancement APIs**:
   - SCIM API: For user provisioning and identity management
   - Chart Annotations API: For documenting important events on charts
   - Releases API: For tracking product releases
   - Event Streaming Metrics API: For monitoring data delivery

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **device_id**: A unique identifier for a device or browser
- **user_id**: A unique identifier for a user, typically set by the client application
- **event_type**: The name of the action being tracked
- **insert_id**: A unique identifier for an event used for deduplication
- **user_properties**: Attributes associated with a user
- **event_properties**: Attributes associated with a specific event
- **group_properties**: Attributes associated with a group of users
- **cohort**: A segment of users defined by behavioral criteria
- **amplitude_id**: Amplitude's internal user identifier
- **global_user_id**: An identifier used to connect users across projects

Property operations:
- **$set**: Sets the value of a property
- **$setOnce**: Sets a property value only if it's not already set
- **$add**: Increments a numeric property
- **$append/$prepend**: Adds values to a list property
- **$unset**: Removes a property

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's API suite integrates with the broader Amplitude product ecosystem:

1. **Analytics Platform**: The HTTP V2 API and Batch Event Upload API feed data into Amplitude's analytics engine, which processes and stores events for analysis.

2. **Dashboard and Reporting**: The Dashboard REST API allows programmatic access to the same data displayed in Amplitude's web interface.

3. **User Management**: The Identify API, User Mapping API, and SCIM API work together to maintain consistent user identities across the platform.

4. **Data Governance**: The Taxonomy API and User Privacy API support Amplitude's data governance capabilities, ensuring proper data classification and compliance.

5. **Cross-Project Analysis**: The Portfolio add-on enables cross-project user counting through the User Mapping API.

6. **Activation**: The User Profile API requires an Activation plan and enables personalization use cases.
