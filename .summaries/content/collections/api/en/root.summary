## Amplitude Analytics API Suite

Amplitude provides a comprehensive suite of REST APIs for analytics data ingestion, user management, data export, and privacy compliance. The platform serves as a product analytics solution with robust server-side integration capabilities, supporting both real-time event streaming and batch data operations.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The API ecosystem is organized around several core functional areas:

**Data Ingestion Layer:**
- **HTTP V2 API** (`/2/httpapi`) serves as the primary event ingestion endpoint, supporting real-time server-side event tracking with comprehensive field specifications
- **Batch Event Upload API** (`/batch`) handles large-scale data uploads up to 20MB with rate limiting of 1000 events per second per device/user ID
- **Attribution API** (`/attribution`) processes advertising campaign attribution using platform-specific identifiers (idfa, idfv, adid, android_app_set_id)

**User and Group Management:**
- **Identify API** (`/identify`) manages User ID to Device ID mappings and user property updates without generating events
- **Group Identify API** (`/groupidentify`) handles group-level properties for account-based analytics through the Accounts add-on
- **User Mapping API** (`/usermap`) provides cross-project user aliasing capabilities via the Portfolio add-on

**Data Access and Export:**
- **Export API** (`/api/2/export`) enables bulk event data extraction in zipped JSON format with 4GB size limits
- **Dashboard REST API** provides programmatic access to analytics results including funnels, retention, segmentation, and revenue metrics
- **User Profile API** (`profile-api.amplitude.com/v1/userprofile`) retrieves comprehensive user profiles including computed properties and ML predictions

**Schema and Configuration Management:**
- **Taxonomy API** (Enterprise) provides CRUD operations for event schema management including categories, event types, and property definitions
- **Lookup Table API v3** (`/api/3/lookup_table`) enables CSV-based property augmentation with 100MB file and 1M row limits
- **Releases API** (`/api/2/release`) supports deployment workflow integration with chart annotations

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Identifiers:**
- `amplitude_id`: Internal Amplitude user identifier
- `device_id`: Device-specific identifier for anonymous tracking
- `user_id`: Customer-defined user identifier
- `global_user_id`: Cross-project user identifier for Portfolio customers

**Event Structure:**
- `event_type`: Categorical event name
- `event_properties`: Event-specific metadata
- `user_properties`: User-level attributes with operation support ($set, $setOnce, $add, $append, $prepend, $unset)
- `group_properties`: Account/organization-level properties
- `insert_id`: Deduplication identifier for event uniqueness

**API Authentication:**
- `api_key`: Project-level authentication for data ingestion
- `secret_key`: Enhanced authentication for profile access
- `scim_key`: SCIM 2.0 provisioning authentication
- HTTP Basic Authentication: Username/password for management APIs

**Rate Limiting and Quotas:**
- EPDS (Events Per Device per Second): Device-level rate limiting
- EPUS (Events Per User per Second): User-level rate limiting
- Cost-based limiting for query APIs with concurrent and period limits

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The API suite integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics platform through several key mechanisms:

**Identity Resolution:** The platform maintains a unified identity graph through device_id/user_id mappings, enhanced by the User Mapping API for cross-project identity resolution in Portfolio configurations.

**Real-time and Batch Processing:** Event ingestion supports both real-time streaming via HTTP V2 API and batch processing for historical data migration, with automatic deduplication using insert_id.

**Enterprise Features:** Advanced capabilities like Taxonomy management, SCIM provisioning, and Behavioral Cohorts require specific plan tiers (Enterprise, Growth) and add-ons (Accounts, Portfolio).

**Privacy and Compliance:** Comprehensive privacy controls through User Privacy API for GDPR/CCPA deletion requests and CCPA DSAR API for data access requests, with 30-day deletion timelines.

**Third-party Integration:** Attribution API supports advertising platform integration, while SCIM API enables Identity Provider synchronization with Okta and JumpCloud.
