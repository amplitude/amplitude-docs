## Amplitude Analytics API Suite

Amplitude provides a comprehensive suite of REST APIs for analytics data ingestion, user management, data export, and platform configuration. The APIs support both real-time event tracking and bulk data operations with robust authentication, rate limiting, and compliance features.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The API ecosystem is organized around several core functional areas:

**Data Ingestion APIs** form the foundation, with the HTTP V2 API serving as the primary event ingestion endpoint (`/2/httpapi`), complemented by the Batch Event Upload API for bulk operations (20MB payload limit). The Attribution API handles advertising attribution events, while specialized APIs like Identify and Group Identify manage user and group property updates without sending events.

**Data Export and Access APIs** enable data retrieval through the Export API (4GB limit, zipped JSON), Dashboard REST API for analytics queries, and User Profile API for individual user data. The CCPA DSAR API provides compliant data access for privacy requests.

**Management and Configuration APIs** include the Taxonomy API for schema management (Enterprise), Lookup Table APIs (v1 deprecated, v3 current) for CSV-based property augmentation, and SCIM 2.0 for user provisioning. The Behavioral Cohorts API manages user segments with asynchronous operations.

**Operational APIs** cover the Releases API for deployment tracking, Chart Annotations API for timeline markers, User Privacy API for GDPR/CCPA deletion, User Mapping API for cross-project identity resolution, and Event Streaming Metrics API for monitoring data delivery.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Identifiers:**
- `amplitude_id`: Amplitude's internal user identifier
- `user_id`: Customer-defined user identifier  
- `device_id`: Device-specific identifier
- `session_id`: Session tracking identifier
- `insert_id`: Event deduplication identifier

**Authentication Methods:**
- API Key authentication for event ingestion
- HTTP Basic authentication for management APIs
- Secret key authentication for User Profile API
- SCIM key authentication for user provisioning

**Event Structure:**
- `event_type`: The name/category of the event
- `event_properties`: Custom properties specific to the event
- `user_properties`: Properties associated with the user
- `group_properties`: Properties for group-level analytics (Accounts add-on)

**Property Operations:**
- `$set`: Set property value
- `$setOnce`: Set only if not already set
- `$add`: Add numeric value
- `$append`: Append to array
- `$prepend`: Prepend to array  
- `$unset`: Remove property

**Rate Limiting and Throttling:**
- Events per second (EPS) limits with 429 responses
- Cost-based rate limiting for management APIs
- Concurrent request limits for bulk operations

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The APIs integrate with Amplitude's broader analytics platform through several key mechanisms:

**Plan-Based Feature Access:** Many APIs require specific Amplitude plans - Enterprise for Taxonomy API, Accounts add-on for Group Identify, Portfolio add-on for User Mapping, and Activation plan for User Profile API.

**Regional Data Residency:** APIs support EU data residency with dedicated endpoints (`api.eu.amplitude.com`) alongside standard US endpoints (`api2.amplitude.com`).

**Asynchronous Processing:** Several APIs implement three-step asynchronous patterns (request → poll status → download) for heavy operations like cohort exports, DSAR requests, and data exports.

**Cross-Project Functionality:** User Mapping API enables identity resolution across projects within portfolios, while some APIs like Export have cross-project view limitations.

## Key API Endpoints and Operations

**Primary Ingestion:**
- `POST /2/httpapi` - Real-time event ingestion
- `POST /batch` - Bulk event upload (20MB limit)
- `POST /identify` - User property updates
- `POST /groupidentify` - Group property updates
- `POST /attribution` - Attribution events

**Data Access:**
- `GET /api/2/export` - Event data export (4GB limit)
- `GET /v1/userprofile` - Individual user profiles
- Dashboard REST API endpoints for analytics queries

**Management Operations:**
- `POST /api/2/release` - Create product releases
- `POST /api/2/annotations` - Create chart annotations
- SCIM 2.0 endpoints for user/group provisioning
- Taxonomy API endpoints for schema management
- `POST /api/2/deletions/users` - GDPR/CCPA user deletion

**Monitoring:**
- Event Streaming Metrics API for delivery monitoring
- Status polling endpoints for asynchronous operations

The API suite provides comprehensive coverage for analytics implementation, from basic event tracking to enterprise-grade data management and compliance requirements.
