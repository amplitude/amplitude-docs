## Amplitude Analytics API Platform

Amplitude provides a comprehensive suite of REST APIs for analytics data ingestion, user management, data export, and platform administration. The platform supports both real-time event tracking and batch data operations with robust authentication, rate limiting, and compliance features.

## Core Data Ingestion APIs

The **HTTP V2 API** serves as the primary event ingestion endpoint at `api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`, supporting server-to-server event tracking with JSON payloads. The **Batch Event Upload API** handles bulk data ingestion with 20MB payload limits and rate limiting of 1000 events per second per device/user ID. Both APIs use `api_key` authentication and support event deduplication through `insert_id` parameters.

The **Attribution API** specifically handles mobile advertising attribution events, processing advertising IDs (idfa, idfv, adid, android_app_set_id) with a 72-hour attribution window for user matching. Events are sent to `api2.amplitude.com/attribution` for campaign tracking and install attribution.

## User and Group Management APIs

The **Identify API** manages user property updates and User ID to Device ID mappings without sending events, using the `/identify` endpoint with user_properties operations (`$set`, `$setOnce`, `$add`, `$append`, `$prepend`, `$unset`). The **Group Identify API** provides similar functionality for group-level analytics through the Accounts add-on, supporting up to 5 unique group types with 1024 group identifies limit.

The **User Mapping (Aliasing) API** enables cross-project user identity resolution through the Portfolio add-on, mapping different user IDs to a global_user_id via the `/usermap` endpoint with batch limits of 2000 requests and rate limits of 50 events per second.

## Data Export and Analytics APIs

The **Export API** provides bulk event data export through `/api/2/export` with HTTP basic authentication, supporting date range queries up to 365 days with 4GB size limits, returning zipped JSON files with comprehensive event schemas including user_properties, device information, and timestamps.

The **Dashboard REST API** offers programmatic access to Amplitude analytics data in JSON format, including endpoints for user metrics, event segmentation, funnel analysis, retention analysis, session data, and revenue analytics with cost-per-query rate limiting.

The **User Profile API** retrieves comprehensive user profiles at `profile-api.amplitude.com/v1/userprofile`, including user properties, computed user properties, cohort memberships, recommendations, and prediction propensities, requiring Activation plan and secret key authentication.

## Cohort and Segmentation APIs

The **Behavioral Cohorts API** manages user cohorts through asynchronous operations requiring three-step processes (request, poll status, download file). It supports cohort export/import via Amazon S3 pre-signed URLs, with Growth Enterprise plan limits of 500 requests per month and 2 million user cohort size limits. Operations include cohort membership updates (ADD/REMOVE) and sync metadata management.

## Data Management and Schema APIs

The **Taxonomy API** (Enterprise only) provides programmatic event schema management including CRUD operations for event categories, event types, event properties, user properties, and group properties. It supports property classifications (PII, SENSITIVE, REVENUE), validation rules, and visibility controls with cost-based rate limiting.

The **Lookup Table APIs** (both v1 deprecated and v3 current) enable CSV-based property augmentation through `data-api.amplitude.com/api/3/lookup_table`, supporting up to 100MB files with 1,000,000 row limits, case-sensitive exact matching, and incremental merge operations.

## Compliance and Privacy APIs

The **User Privacy API** ensures GDPR/CCPA compliance through programmatic user data deletion via `/api/2/deletions/users`, supporting batch processing with 30-day deletion scheduling, job status tracking, and rate limiting of 1 request per second with 100 users per request.

The **CCPA DSAR API** handles Data Subject Access Requests through asynchronous 3-step processes with 14.4K cost/hour rate limits, 3-day SLA completion, and gzipped JSON output files containing comprehensive user event data.

## Administrative and Monitoring APIs

The **SCIM 2.0 API** provides programmatic user provisioning and group management for Identity Provider integration, supporting user invitation workflows, permission groups, and email-based user identification with 100 requests/minute rate limiting.

The **Chart Annotations API** enables programmatic creation of date-based annotations on Amplitude charts via `/api/2/annotations`, supporting both global project-level and chart-specific annotations for feature releases and marketing campaigns.

The **Releases API** facilitates deployment workflow integration through `/api/2/release` for programmatic product release creation with chart visibility and platform targeting options.

The **Event Streaming Metrics API** monitors delivery metrics for Amplitude event streams using sync_id parameters, providing delivery rates, latency metrics (p95), success rates, and retry statistics with 90-day retention and 4-hour minute-level accuracy for recent data.

## Key Technical Specifications

**Authentication**: HTTP Basic authentication for most APIs, with API key authentication for ingestion endpoints and secret key authentication for User Profile API.

**Rate Limiting**: Varies by endpoint - from 50-1000 events per second for ingestion to 100-600 requests per minute for administrative APIs, with cost-based limiting for analytics queries.

**Regional Support**: EU residency supported through `api.eu.amplitude.com` endpoints for data sovereignty compliance.

**Data Formats**: Primarily JSON with multipart/form-data for file uploads, supporting UTC timestamps in milliseconds since epoch and comprehensive event schemas with user_properties, event_properties, and group_properties.

**Payload Limits**: Range from 4GB for exports to 20MB for batch uploads, with specific row limits (1-2 million) for lookup tables and cohorts.
