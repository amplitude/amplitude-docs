# Amplitude Analytics API Suite

## Product Overview

Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that enables businesses to track, analyze, and optimize user behavior across digital products. The API suite provides programmatic access to Amplitude's core functionalities, allowing developers to integrate Amplitude's analytics capabilities into their workflows, applications, and data pipelines.

Key features of the Amplitude API suite include:
- Event ingestion and tracking via HTTP APIs
- User identity management and property updates
- Data export and retrieval capabilities
- Cohort management and behavioral analysis
- Privacy compliance tools for GDPR and CCPA
- Schema management through taxonomy APIs
- Dashboard and chart data access
- Group-level analytics for B2B use cases
- Cross-project user mapping

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Amplitude API suite consists of several interconnected APIs that serve different purposes within the analytics ecosystem:

1. **Data Ingestion APIs**:
   - HTTP V2 API: The primary endpoint for sending event data to Amplitude
   - Batch Event Upload API: For uploading large volumes of events
   - Identify API: For updating user properties without sending events
   - Group Identify API: For updating group-level properties

2. **Data Retrieval APIs**:
   - Export API: For extracting raw event data
   - Dashboard REST API: For accessing analyzed data from dashboards
   - User Profile API: For retrieving user properties and recommendations
   - Behavioral Cohorts API: For accessing user segments

3. **Data Management APIs**:
   - Taxonomy API: For managing event schema
   - Lookup Table API: For property augmentation and transformation
   - User Mapping API: For cross-project identity resolution
   - User Privacy API: For compliance with data privacy regulations

4. **Annotation and Metadata APIs**:
   - Chart Annotations API: For marking significant events on charts
   - Releases API: For tracking product releases and changes

5. **Administrative APIs**:
   - SCIM API: For user provisioning and access management
   - Event Streaming Metrics API: For monitoring data delivery

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **device_id**: A unique identifier for a device or browser instance
- **user_id**: A unique identifier for a user, typically set when a user logs in
- **event_type**: The name of the action being tracked (e.g., "Button Clicked")
- **event_properties**: Key-value pairs providing context about an event
- **user_properties**: Attributes associated with a user that persist across events
- **group_type/group_value**: Identifiers for organizational structures like accounts or companies
- **group_properties**: Attributes associated with groups rather than individual users
- **insert_id**: A unique identifier for an event used for deduplication
- **amplitude_id**: Amplitude's internal user identifier
- **cohort**: A segment of users defined by behavioral criteria
- **lookup table**: A mapping of existing property values to new values for data enrichment
- **taxonomy**: The structured organization of event types, properties, and their metadata

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's API suite integrates with the broader Amplitude product ecosystem in several ways:

1. **Cross-Project Analytics**: The User Mapping API enables connecting user identities across different Amplitude projects, supporting the Portfolio add-on for cross-project analysis.

2. **B2B Analytics**: The Group Identify API supports the Accounts add-on, allowing analysis at the account or organization level rather than just individual users.

3. **Data Activation**: The User Profile API connects with Amplitude's Activation capabilities, enabling personalization and targeted engagement based on user behavior.

4. **Data Governance**: The Taxonomy API supports Enterprise-tier features for maintaining consistent data schemas across an organization.

5. **Privacy Compliance**: The User Privacy API and CCPA DSAR API enable compliance with global privacy regulations as part of Amplitude's privacy framework.

6. **Visualization Integration**: The Dashboard REST API and Chart Annotations API connect with Amplitude's visualization and reporting capabilities.
