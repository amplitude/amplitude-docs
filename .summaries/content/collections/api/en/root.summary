## Amplitude Analytics API Suite

Amplitude provides a comprehensive suite of REST APIs for analytics data ingestion, user management, data export, and privacy compliance. The platform serves as a product analytics solution with robust server-side integration capabilities, supporting both real-time event tracking and batch data operations.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The API ecosystem is organized around several core functional areas:

**Data Ingestion Layer:**
- **HTTP V2 API** (`/2/httpapi`) serves as the primary event ingestion endpoint, supporting real-time server-side event tracking with comprehensive field specifications
- **Batch Event Upload API** (`/batch`) handles large-scale data uploads up to 20MB with rate limiting of 1000 events per second
- **Attribution API** (`/attribution`) processes advertising campaign attribution using platform-specific identifiers (idfa, idfv, adid, android_app_set_id)

**User and Group Management:**
- **Identify API** (`/identify`) manages User ID to Device ID mappings and user property updates without generating events
- **Group Identify API** (`/groupidentify`) handles group-level properties for account-based analytics (requires Accounts add-on)
- **User Mapping API** (`/usermap`) provides cross-project user aliasing through global user IDs (Portfolio add-on)

**Data Access and Export:**
- **Export API** (`/api/2/export`) enables bulk event data extraction in zipped JSON format with 4GB limits
- **Dashboard REST API** provides programmatic access to analytics results including funnels, retention, segmentation, and revenue metrics
- **User Profile API** (`profile-api.amplitude.com/v1/userprofile`) retrieves comprehensive user profiles including computed properties and ML predictions

**Schema and Configuration Management:**
- **Taxonomy API** (Enterprise) provides CRUD operations for event schema management including categories, event types, and property definitions
- **Lookup Table API v3** (`/api/3/lookup_table`) manages CSV-based property augmentation with 100MB/1M row limits
- **Behavioral Cohorts API** supports cohort management with asynchronous download operations and S3 integration

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Identifiers:**
- `amplitude_id`: Amplitude's internal user identifier
- `user_id`: Customer-defined user identifier
- `device_id`: Device-specific identifier
- `session_id`: Session tracking identifier
- `insert_id`: Event deduplication identifier

**Property Operations:**
- `$set`, `$setOnce`, `$add`, `$append`, `$prepend`, `$unset`: Standard property modification operations
- `$preInsert`, `$postInsert`, `$remove`: Advanced list manipulation operations
- `event_properties`: Event-specific metadata
- `user_properties`: User-level attributes
- `group_properties`: Account/organization-level properties

**API Infrastructure:**
- `api2.amplitude.com`: Primary API endpoint (US)
- `api.eu.amplitude.com`: EU residency endpoint
- `data-api.amplitude.com`: Data management operations
- `profile-api.amplitude.com`: User profile services

**Rate Limiting and Quotas:**
- EPDS (Events Per Device per Second): 1000 limit
- Concurrent request limits: typically 5 requests
- Cost-based rate limiting for analytics queries
- Batch limits: 1024-2000 requests depending on endpoint

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The API suite integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics platform through several key mechanisms:

**Plan-Based Feature Access:**
- Growth/Enterprise plans unlock advanced cohort operations and higher limits
- Accounts add-on enables group-level analytics
- Portfolio add-on provides cross-project user mapping
- Activation plan required for User Profile API access

**Data Pipeline Integration:**
- Event Streaming Metrics API monitors delivery to external destinations
- Warehouse CDC integration with deletion job warnings
- Amazon S3 fallback for large export operations
- Real-time vs. batch processing pathways

**Compliance and Privacy:**
- GDPR/CCPA compliance through User Privacy API (`/api/2/deletions/users`)
- CCPA DSAR API for data subject access requests with 3-day SLA
- Data residency options (US/EU endpoints)
- Retention policies (72-hour attribution window, 90-day streaming metrics)

**Authentication Patterns:**
- HTTP Basic Authentication using API keys for most endpoints
- Secret key authentication for sensitive user profile operations
- SCIM key authentication for identity provider integrations
- Organization vs. project-level API key scoping

**Integration Ecosystem:**
- SCIM 2.0 support for identity providers (Okta, JumpCloud)
- Partner integration support in HTTP V2 API
- Chart annotations for release tracking and deployment workflows
- Multi-language SDK support with debugging tools

The platform emphasizes asynchronous operations for large data operations (exports, cohort downloads, DSAR requests) using a consistent three-step pattern: request initiation, status polling, and file download via pre-signed URLs.
