# Amplitude API Suite

## Product Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive analytics and data platform that helps organizations understand user behavior, track events, manage user data, and derive insights from digital interactions. The API suite provides programmatic access to Amplitude's core functionalities, enabling developers to integrate Amplitude's analytics capabilities into their workflows, applications, and data pipelines.

Key features of the Amplitude API suite include:
- Event ingestion and tracking via HTTP endpoints
- User identity management and property updates
- Data export and retrieval capabilities
- Cohort management and behavioral analysis
- Dashboard and visualization data access
- Privacy compliance and user data management
- Schema and taxonomy management
- Cross-project user mapping

The platform serves various use cases including product analytics, user behavior tracking, marketing campaign attribution, compliance with privacy regulations, and integration with broader data ecosystems.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Amplitude API suite consists of several interconnected APIs that work together to provide a complete analytics solution:

1. **Data Ingestion APIs**:
   - HTTP V2 API: The primary method for sending event data to Amplitude
   - Batch Event Upload API: For uploading large volumes of historical event data
   - Identify API: For updating user properties without sending events
   - Group Identify API: For setting properties on groups (requires Accounts add-on)
   - Attribution API: For tracking marketing campaign attribution

2. **Data Retrieval APIs**:
   - Export API: For extracting raw event data
   - Dashboard REST API: For accessing processed analytics data
   - User Profile API: For retrieving user properties and recommendations
   - Behavioral Cohorts API: For working with user segments

3. **Data Management APIs**:
   - Taxonomy API: For managing event schema
   - Lookup Table API: For property augmentation and transformation
   - User Mapping API: For cross-project identity resolution
   - User Privacy API: For GDPR/CCPA compliance

4. **Operational APIs**:
   - SCIM API: For user provisioning and access management
   - Releases API: For documenting product releases
   - Chart Annotations API: For marking significant events on charts
   - Event Streaming Metrics API: For monitoring data delivery

These APIs are designed to work together, with data flowing from ingestion endpoints through Amplitude's processing pipeline and then becoming available through the various retrieval and management APIs.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: A discrete user action or occurrence tracked in Amplitude, containing properties and identifiers
- **device_id**: A unique identifier for a device or browser instance
- **user_id**: A unique identifier for a user, which can be mapped to multiple device_ids
- **amplitude_id**: Amplitude's internal user identifier
- **event_type**: The name/category of an event being tracked
- **event_properties**: Key-value pairs providing context about an event
- **user_properties**: Attributes associated with a user that persist across events
- **group_properties**: Attributes associated with a group (like account or organization)
- **insert_id**: A unique identifier for an event used for deduplication
- **cohort**: A segment of users defined by behavioral criteria
- **lookup table**: A mapping of existing property values to new values for data enrichment
- **taxonomy**: The schema definition for events, properties, and their metadata

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's API suite is designed to integrate with the broader data and analytics ecosystem:

1. **Data Collection Integration**: The HTTP APIs allow data to be sent from various sources:
   - Client-side applications (web, mobile)
   - Server-side systems
   - Data pipelines and ETL processes
   - Third-party tools via webhooks

2. **Identity Resolution**: The User Mapping API enables cross-project and cross-platform identity resolution, supporting a unified view of users across multiple touchpoints.

3. **Data Activation**: The User Profile and Behavioral Cohorts APIs enable activation of insights by making user data and segments available to other systems.

4. **Enterprise Systems Integration**: The SCIM API allows integration with identity providers like Okta and JumpCloud for user provisioning.

5. **Privacy Compliance**: The User Privacy API and CCPA DSAR API support integration with privacy management systems.

6. **Data Residency**: The platform supports EU data residency with specific API endpoints for European customers.
