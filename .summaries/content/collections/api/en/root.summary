## Product Overview

Amplitude's Event Ingestion API provides server-to-server event data collection capabilities for analytics and user behavior tracking. The API offers two primary endpoints for sending event data: the HTTP V2 API for standard event ingestion and the Batch Event Upload API for high-volume bulk data uploads. Both APIs enable real-time and batch processing of user events, user properties, group operations, and revenue tracking data with comprehensive rate limiting and data validation features.

## Product Relationships and Features

The two API endpoints serve complementary purposes within Amplitude's data ingestion infrastructure:

**HTTP V2 API** (`api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`) serves as the standard ingestion endpoint with moderate volume limits (1MB payload, 2000 events per request) and is designed for real-time event streaming from application servers.

**Batch Event Upload API** (`/batch` endpoint) handles high-volume data ingestion with significantly larger payload limits (20MB) and higher throughput requirements, making it suitable for data migration, ETL processes, and bulk historical data uploads.

Both APIs share common event schema and authentication mechanisms while implementing different rate limiting strategies to optimize for their respective use cases.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Event Structure:**
- `event_type`: Required identifier for the type of action being tracked
- `user_id`: Unique identifier for authenticated users
- `device_id`: Unique identifier for devices/anonymous users
- `insert_id`: Deduplication key to prevent duplicate event processing

**Data Organization:**
- `user_properties`: Attributes associated with users that persist across sessions
- `event_properties`: Contextual data specific to individual events
- `group_properties`: Attributes for account-level or organizational data (requires accounts addon)
- `groups`: Mechanism for associating users with organizational entities

**Session and Revenue Tracking:**
- `session_id`: Groups events into user sessions
- `event_id`: Unique identifier for individual events
- Revenue tracking fields for e-commerce and monetization analytics

**Special Operations:**
- `$identify`: User property update operations
- `$groupidentify`: Group property update operations

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Event Ingestion APIs serve as the foundational data collection layer for Amplitude's analytics platform. They integrate with:

**Partner Integrations:** Support for `partner_id` parameter enables third-party data sources and integration platforms to send data on behalf of customers.

**Device Management:** Integration with device silencing capabilities for data quality control and compliance requirements.

**Rate Limiting Infrastructure:** Sophisticated throttling mechanisms (EPDS/EPUS for batch, hourly limits for HTTP V2) that scale with usage patterns and prevent system overload.

## API Endpoints and Technical Specifications

**HTTP V2 API:**
- Endpoint: `api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`
- Method: POST with JSON payload
- Limits: 1MB payload, 2000 events per request
- Rate limiting: 1800 user property updates per hour
- Authentication: `api_key` parameter

**Batch Event Upload API:**
- Endpoint: `/batch`
- Method: POST with `application/json` content-type
- Limits: 20MB payload
- Rate limiting: 1000 events per second per device/user ID, 500,000 events per day
- Authentication: `api_key` parameter
- Response codes: HTTP 429 for throttling

**Common Configuration Options:**
- `min_id_length`: Validation for minimum identifier length requirements
- Language field mapping for internationalization
- Comprehensive error handling with specific HTTP status codes (400, 413, 429, 503)

The APIs support both real-time streaming and batch processing workflows, enabling flexible data collection strategies that can scale from small applications to enterprise-level implementations with millions of daily events.
