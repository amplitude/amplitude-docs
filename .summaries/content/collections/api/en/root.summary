## Amplitude Analytics API Suite

Amplitude provides a comprehensive suite of REST APIs for analytics data ingestion, user management, data export, and platform configuration. The API ecosystem supports both real-time event streaming and batch processing workflows, with enterprise-grade features for data governance, privacy compliance, and cross-project analytics.

## Core Data Ingestion APIs

The **HTTP V2 API** (`/2/httpapi`) serves as the primary server-side event ingestion endpoint, supporting real-time event streaming with comprehensive field specifications including event_type, user_properties, group_properties, and revenue tracking. The **Batch Event Upload API** (`/batch`) handles large-scale data ingestion with JSON payloads up to 20MB and rate limiting of 1000 events per second per device/user ID.

The **Identify API** (`/identify`) manages User ID to Device ID mappings and user property updates without triggering events, supporting operations like $set, $setOnce, $add, $append, $prepend, $unset, $preInsert, $postInsert, and $remove. The **Group Identify API** (`/groupidentify`) extends this functionality to group-level properties with support for up to 5 unique group types and 10 total groups per event.

## Data Export and Analytics APIs

The **Export API** (`/api/2/export`) enables bulk event data extraction in zipped JSON format with 4GB size limits and 365-day maximum query periods. The **Dashboard REST API** provides programmatic access to Amplitude's analytics capabilities including event segmentation, funnel analysis, retention analysis, user activity metrics, and revenue analytics through JSON-formatted endpoints.

The **User Profile API** (`profile-api.amplitude.com/v1/userprofile`) retrieves comprehensive user profiles including computed properties, cohort memberships, recommendations, and prediction propensities, requiring an Activation plan and secret key authentication.

## User Management and Privacy APIs

The **User Privacy API** (`/api/2/deletions/users`) handles GDPR/CCPA compliance through programmatic user data deletion with 30-day processing timelines and organization-wide deletion capabilities. The **CCPA DSAR API** provides Data Subject Access Request functionality through an asynchronous three-step process (request → poll → download) with 14.4K cost/hour rate limits and 3-day SLA completion.

The **User Mapping API** (`/usermap`) supports cross-project user identity resolution through the Portfolio add-on, enabling global_user_id mapping across multiple Amplitude projects.

## Enterprise Configuration APIs

The **SCIM 2.0 API** enables automated user provisioning and group management with Identity Provider integrations (Okta, JumpCloud), supporting standard SCIM operations with 100 requests/minute rate limiting.

The **Taxonomy API** provides Enterprise users with programmatic event schema management, supporting CRUD operations for categories, event types, properties, and classifications (PII, SENSITIVE, REVENUE) with Data Access Controls integration.

## Specialized Feature APIs

The **Behavioral Cohorts API** (v3/v5) manages user cohort operations through asynchronous workflows, supporting cohort downloads, uploads, and incremental updates with 2 million user limits and Amazon S3 pre-signed URL delivery.

The **Lookup Table API** (v3) enables CSV-based property augmentation with 100MB file limits and 1,000,000 row capacity, supporting both incremental updates and full overrides through multipart/form-data uploads.

The **Attribution API** processes advertising attribution events using platform-specific identifiers (idfa, idfv, adid, android_app_set_id) with 72-hour matching windows. The **Releases API** (`/api/2/release`) integrates deployment workflows with chart annotations for release tracking.

## Authentication and Rate Limiting

All APIs use HTTP Basic authentication with API keys or secret keys, depending on the endpoint. Rate limiting varies by API, with common patterns including cost-per-query models, concurrent request limits (typically 5), and per-second throttling. EU data residency is supported through dedicated endpoints (api.eu.amplitude.com) for applicable services.

The **Event Streaming Metrics API** provides delivery monitoring for streaming destinations with sync_id-based tracking and 90-day retention for delivery metrics including latency, success rates, and failure categorization.
