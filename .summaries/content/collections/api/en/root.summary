# Amplitude API Suite

## Product Overview

Amplitude provides a comprehensive analytics platform with a suite of APIs that enable developers to programmatically interact with various aspects of the platform. The APIs support event tracking, user management, data export, cohort analysis, and privacy compliance features. Key capabilities include sending event data, managing user identities, retrieving analytics, configuring taxonomies, and ensuring compliance with privacy regulations.

## Key Features and Concepts

1. **Event Ingestion** - Multiple APIs for sending event data to Amplitude:
   - HTTP V2 API for real-time event tracking
   - Batch Event Upload API for large volumes of data (up to 20MB)
   - Identify API for updating user properties without sending events
   - Group Identify API for setting properties on groups of users

2. **Data Retrieval and Analysis**:
   - Dashboard REST API for accessing analytics data
   - Export API for retrieving raw event data
   - Behavioral Cohorts API for working with user segments
   - User Profile API for accessing user properties and recommendations

3. **Data Management**:
   - Taxonomy API for managing event schema
   - Lookup Table API for property augmentation
   - User Mapping API for cross-project identity resolution
   - Chart Annotations API for documenting important events

4. **Privacy and Compliance**:
   - User Privacy API for GDPR/CCPA compliance
   - CCPA DSAR API for data subject access requests

5. **User Management**:
   - SCIM API for user provisioning and permission management

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Amplitude API ecosystem is structured around several core components:

1. **Data Collection Layer**:
   - HTTP V2 API serves as the primary ingestion endpoint
   - Batch Event Upload API handles bulk data ingestion
   - Attribution API captures marketing attribution data
   - Identify and Group Identify APIs manage user and group properties

2. **Analytics and Reporting Layer**:
   - Dashboard REST API provides access to analytics data
   - Export API enables raw data extraction
   - Chart Annotations API enhances data visualization

3. **User Management Layer**:
   - User Profile API provides user data access
   - Behavioral Cohorts API manages user segments
   - User Mapping API handles cross-project identity
   - SCIM API manages user provisioning

4. **Data Governance Layer**:
   - Taxonomy API manages event schema
   - Lookup Table API augments properties
   - User Privacy API and CCPA DSAR API ensure compliance

5. **Operational Layer**:
   - Event Streaming Metrics API monitors data delivery
   - Releases API tracks product changes

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Identity Concepts**:
   - `device_id`: Unique identifier for a device
   - `user_id`: Identifier for a logged-in user
   - `amplitude_id`: Amplitude's internal user identifier
   - `global_user_id`: Cross-project identifier for the same user

2. **Event Data Structure**:
   - `event_type`: The name of the tracked event
   - `user_properties`: Attributes associated with users
   - `event_properties`: Attributes associated with events
   - `group_properties`: Attributes associated with groups
   - `insert_id`: Unique identifier for event deduplication

3. **Property Operations**:
   - `$set`: Set a property value
   - `$setOnce`: Set a property value only if it doesn't exist
   - `$add`: Increment a numeric property
   - `$append`/`$prepend`: Add values to a list property
   - `$unset`: Remove a property

4. **Rate Limiting Concepts**:
   - EPDS: Events Per Device Second
   - EPUS: Events Per User Second

## Integration with Amplitude Ecosystem

The APIs integrate with various Amplitude products:

1. **Amplitude Analytics** - Core analytics platform that receives data from HTTP V2 API and provides data through Dashboard REST API and Export API.

2. **Amplitude Experiment** - Feature flagging and experimentation platform that can leverage user properties set through the Identify API.

3. **Amplitude CDP** - Customer Data Platform that utilizes the User Mapping API for identity resolution and the User Profile API for activation.

4. **Amplitude Audiences** - Audience segmentation tool that works with the Behavioral Cohorts API.

5. **Amplitude Data** - Data management solution that leverages the Taxonomy API and Lookup Table API.

The APIs support various authentication methods, primarily HTTP Basic Authentication with API keys, and have specific rate limits and quotas that vary by endpoint and subscription tier, with Enterprise customers generally receiving higher limits.
