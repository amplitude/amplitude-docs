# Amplitude Analytics Product Suite: Other Charts and SQL Capabilities

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude's analytics platform extends beyond standard visualizations with specialized tools for deeper data analysis. The "Other Charts" collection includes Amplitude SQL and the User Composition Chart, providing advanced capabilities for data analysts and product teams. These tools enable custom SQL queries against Amplitude data and specialized user property analysis, helping teams gain deeper insights into user behavior and audience composition.

## Product Relationships and Features

### Amplitude SQL

Amplitude SQL is a component of the Query add-on product available to Growth and Enterprise plan customers. It provides direct SQL access to Amplitude data stored in Snowflake databases, enabling:

- Custom queries beyond standard Amplitude charts
- Visualization of query results
- SQL autocomplete functionality
- Access to the comprehensive `$events` table

Amplitude SQL serves as a bridge between Amplitude's user-friendly interface and more technical SQL-based analysis, allowing data analysts to perform custom analyses while still leveraging Amplitude's visualization capabilities.

### User Composition Chart

The User Composition chart focuses on analyzing who users are rather than what they do, providing:

- Breakdown of active users based on user properties
- Comparison capabilities between different user segments
- Insights into user demographics and characteristics
- Multiple viewing options:
  - Most recent values
  - All values
  - Cross property values

This chart complements event-based analyses by offering a non-event-driven perspective on user characteristics.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Amplitude SQL Terms

- **$events table**: Primary table containing all event data in Amplitude's Snowflake database
- **$date**: Field shortcut that leverages Amplitude's date picker UI
- **$amplitude_id**: Unique identifier for users
- **event_time**: Server-side timestamp when an event was received
- **client_event_time**: Client-side timestamp when an event occurred
- **variant data type**: Flexible Snowflake data type that stores various data types
- **event_properties**: JSON object containing properties associated with events
- **user_properties**: JSON object containing properties associated with users

### User Composition Terms

- **User property**: Attributes associated with users (demographics, preferences, etc.)
- **Most recent value**: Latest value of a property for each user
- **All values**: All historical values of a property across users
- **Cross property values**: Analysis across multiple properties
- **Active users**: Users who performed any activity in the specified time range
- **Segment**: Defined subset of users based on specific criteria

## Product Ecosystem Integration

These specialized tools integrate with Amplitude's broader ecosystem by:

1. Using the same underlying data as other Amplitude features
2. Providing complementary analysis capabilities:
   - Amplitude SQL offers technical depth for data analysts
   - User Composition Chart provides user-centric analysis
3. Supporting visualization creation that can be incorporated into Amplitude dashboards
4. Bridging the gap between user-friendly interfaces and technical data exploration

Amplitude SQL specifically connects to Snowflake databases where Amplitude data is stored, allowing for more complex queries while maintaining the connection to Amplitude's visualization layer.

## Technical Details

### Amplitude SQL

- Queries target the `$events` table in Snowflake
- Data is loaded at 30-minute intervals (not real-time)
- Export limit: 1,000 rows maximum
- Standard SQL syntax with Snowflake-specific features
- Example query:
  ```sql
  SELECT event_type, COUNT(*) as count
  FROM $events
  WHERE $date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-01-31'
  GROUP BY event_type
  ORDER BY count DESC
  ```

### $events Table Schema

The `$events` table includes numerous columns for analysis:
- **amplitude_id** (string): Unique user identifier
- **event_type** (string): Name of the event
- **event_time** (timestamp): Server-side timestamp
- **client_event_time** (timestamp): Client-side timestamp
- **event_properties** (variant): JSON object with event properties
- **user_properties** (variant): JSON object with user properties
- **platform** (string): Platform where event occurred
- **device_id** (string): Device identifier
- **session_id** (number): Session identifier

Additional columns include user demographics, device information, location data, and various tracking identifiers.
