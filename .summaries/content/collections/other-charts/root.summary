# Amplitude Analytics Product Suite: Other Charts and SQL Capabilities

## Product Overview

Amplitude's analytics suite extends beyond standard visualizations with specialized charts and SQL querying capabilities. The "Other Charts" collection features User Composition analysis tools and Amplitude SQL, enabling deeper analysis of user behavior, segment properties, and custom data exploration through direct SQL access to Amplitude data stored in Snowflake.

## Key Features

### User Composition Chart
A specialized visualization tool that breaks down active users based on user properties, providing non-event-driven analysis to understand user characteristics and shared properties across segments.

**Capabilities:**
- Segment users by single user property
- Compare property distributions across different segments
- View data in three modes:
  - Most recent value: Latest property value per user
  - All values: All property values during the timeframe
  - Cross property values: Analyze relationships between multiple properties

### Amplitude SQL
Available to Growth and Enterprise plan customers, this feature allows writing custom SQL queries directly against Amplitude data in Snowflake.

**Capabilities:**
- Write custom SQL using standard syntax
- Access complete event and user data through predefined schemas
- Visualize query results within Amplitude
- Use SQL autocomplete for easier query writing
- Export results (limited to 1,000 rows)

## Product Relationships

These features represent complementary approaches to data analysis:

- **User Composition Chart**: Provides structured, UI-driven analysis of user properties without requiring SQL knowledge
- **Amplitude SQL**: Offers direct access to raw data for custom analysis beyond pre-built charts

Both extend Amplitude's core analytics by providing different levels of analytical flexibility based on user needs and technical expertise.

## Key Nomenclature

### Amplitude SQL Schema
- **$events**: Primary table containing all event data
- **$date**: Special field shortcut for leveraging Amplitude's UI date picker
- **$amplitude_id**: Unique identifier for each user
- **event_time**: Server-recorded timestamp of event occurrence
- **client_event_time**: Device-recorded timestamp of event occurrence
- **variant data type**: Flexible data type for event_properties and user_properties

### User Composition Terminology
- **User property**: Attributes associated with users (country, device type, etc.)
- **Segment**: Defined group of users based on specific criteria
- **Most recent value**: Latest property value for each user
- **All values**: All property values users had during the timeframe
- **Cross property values**: Analysis of relationships between multiple properties

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude SQL integrates with the broader ecosystem by:
1. Accessing the same data that powers other Amplitude visualizations
2. Allowing results visualization using Amplitude's charting capabilities
3. Supporting the Query add-on product for advanced analytics
4. Connecting to Snowflake as the underlying data storage system

The User Composition chart complements event-based analytics by focusing on user attributes rather than behaviors, providing a more complete picture when used alongside other Amplitude charts.

## Technical Specifications

### Amplitude SQL
- Data refreshes in Snowflake every 30 minutes
- Maximum export limit of 1,000 rows
- Comprehensive schema including:
  - user_id, amplitude_id, device_id
  - event_type, event_time, client_event_time
  - platform, os_name, os_version
  - device_brand, device_manufacturer, device_model
  - country, region, city
  - event_properties, user_properties (as variant data types)
  - Various attribution and tracking columns

### User Composition Chart
- Focuses on user property analysis rather than event analysis
- Requires properly implemented user properties
