## Amplitude Analytics Platform - Other Charts Collection

This collection represents Amplitude's advanced analytics capabilities that extend beyond standard event tracking, providing specialized tools for custom data exploration and user-centric analysis within the broader analytics ecosystem.

## High-Level Product Overview

The Other Charts collection encompasses three core analytical capabilities designed for advanced users requiring deeper data access and specialized analysis patterns. **Amplitude SQL** provides direct SQL querying capabilities against event data stored in Snowflake databases, enabling custom analysis beyond pre-built chart types. **User Composition charts** shift focus from event-driven analytics to user property analysis, examining user demographics and characteristics rather than behavioral patterns. The **SQL Schema documentation** serves as the technical foundation, defining data structures and field mappings that enable both custom querying and standardized data access.

Key use cases include custom cohort analysis through SQL queries, demographic segmentation via user composition charts, and advanced data exploration for users requiring flexibility beyond standard analytics interfaces. The platform targets Growth and Enterprise customers with the Query add-on, indicating positioning as premium analytical capabilities.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

Amplitude SQL functions as the platform's custom query engine, bridging pre-built analytics with flexible data exploration needs. It operates on a 30-minute data loading cycle, ensuring near real-time access while maintaining query performance against Snowflake infrastructure.

User Composition charts complement the platform's event-driven analytics by focusing on user properties rather than event behaviors. This creates a dual analytical approach where standard charts analyze what users do, while User Composition examines who users are based on their attributes and characteristics.

The SQL Schema documentation underpins both capabilities, providing the structural foundation that enables SQL querying while also supporting general data access patterns across the platform. This schema serves as the contract between Amplitude's event collection system and analytical interfaces.

Notably, Portfolio Views integration is absent for SQL charts, indicating these tools are designed for individual project analysis rather than cross-project reporting, distinguishing them from standard analytics that support portfolio-level insights.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**$events table**: The primary data repository containing all event records, accessible through simplified shorthand syntax in Amplitude SQL queries, abstracting the underlying Snowflake table structure.

**Field shortcuts** provide predefined aliases for common query patterns:
- `$date`: Integrates with datepicker functionality for time-based filtering
- `$events`: References the main events table
- `$amplitude_id`: Manages user identification including merged user scenarios

**Property Classification** distinguishes data types through schema prefixes:
- `user_properties`: User-associated attributes (demographics, account information)
- `event_properties`: Event-specific attributes tied to individual actions

**User Composition Measurement Types**:
- **Most Recent Value**: Analyzes users based on their latest property values
- **All Values**: Includes complete historical property value sets
- **Cross Property Values**: Examines relationships and combinations between multiple user properties

**Merged Users**: Amplitude's identity resolution system tracked through `merged_amplitude_id` fields, maintaining data integrity when user identities are consolidated across devices or sessions.

**VARIANT Data Types**: Snowflake's flexible data structure handling dynamic event and user property schemas, enabling schema evolution without breaking existing queries.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude SQL integrates directly with Snowflake infrastructure, requiring specific plan tiers (Growth/Enterprise with Query add-on) and geographic availability (EU restrictions apply), indicating infrastructure and compliance considerations within the broader product architecture.

The User Composition functionality leverages the same user property infrastructure powering segmentation and cohort analysis across the platform, ensuring consistency in user attribute handling while providing specialized analytical interfaces.

Data loading operates on standardized 30-minute cycles, aligning with platform-wide data processing schedules while balancing real-time access needs with query performance requirements.

The absence of Portfolio Views support for SQL charts suggests architectural decisions prioritizing individual project analysis over cross-project reporting, distinguishing advanced analytical tools from standard dashboard capabilities.

## Technical Implementation and API Access

**Database Access**: SQL queries execute against Snowflake databases using the `$events` table schema, with direct SQL syntax support enabling complex analytical operations beyond standard chart capabilities.

**Temporal Data Handling**: Multiple timestamp fields support different analytical requirements:
- `event_time`: Client-side event timestamp for user experience analysis
- `client_event_time`: Original client timestamp preserving user timezone context
- `server_received_time`: Server processing timestamp in UTC for system analysis

**User Identification System**: Multi-layered identifier support including:
- `user_id`: Business logic user identification
- `amplitude_id`: Platform-specific user tracking
- `adid`/`idfa`: Advertising identifier integration
- `session_id`: Session-based analysis capabilities

**Geographic Analysis**: Location tracking through `latitude`/`longitude` fields enables geographic segmentation and analysis within SQL query contexts.

**Data Structure**: VARIANT data types accommodate flexible event and user property schemas, supporting dynamic property addition without schema migration requirements, enabling rapid feature development and custom property implementation.
