# Amplitude Analytics Product Suite: Other Charts and SQL Capabilities

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude is an analytics platform for tracking, analyzing, and visualizing user behavior data. The "Other Charts" collection extends Amplitude's core analytics with specialized visualization tools and SQL capabilities, including:

- **Amplitude SQL**: A Query product feature enabling direct SQL querying against Amplitude data in Snowflake
- **User Composition Charts**: Visualization tools for analyzing user demographics and properties
- **SQL Schema**: Structured data organization for efficient querying and analysis

These tools provide advanced analytics capabilities for users who need deeper insights beyond standard reports and visualizations.

## Product and Feature Relationships

### Amplitude SQL

Amplitude SQL is available to Growth and Enterprise plan users with the Query add-on. It provides:

- Direct SQL querying against Amplitude data stored in Snowflake
- Access to event data, user properties, and event properties through a structured schema
- Custom visualization creation based on query results
- SQL autocomplete functionality to assist with query writing

This feature extends the Query product by allowing technical users to write custom SQL while still leveraging Amplitude's visualization capabilities.

### User Composition Charts

User Composition charts focus on user demographics rather than behavior, offering:

- Breakdowns of active users based on user properties
- Comparison capabilities between different user segments
- Multiple viewing options: most recent values, all values, or cross-property values
- Non-event-driven analysis focused on user characteristics

These charts complement event-based analytics by providing insights about who users are, rather than what they do.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### SQL Schema Terms

- **$events**: Primary table containing all event data
- **$date**: Special field shortcut for date-based queries
- **$amplitude_id**: Unique identifier for users that handles merged identities
- **event_time**: Server-recorded timestamp when an event occurred
- **client_event_time**: Device-recorded timestamp when an event occurred
- **variant data type**: Flexible data type storing different value types

### User Composition Terms

- **Most recent value**: Latest property value for each user
- **All values**: All property values a user had during the timeframe
- **Cross property values**: Relationships between multiple user properties
- **Active users**: Users who performed any event during the specified time period

## Product Ecosystem Integration

These specialized charts and SQL capabilities integrate with Amplitude's broader ecosystem by:

1. Accessing the same underlying data as other Amplitude features
2. Providing alternative analysis methods for that data
3. Supporting Growth and Enterprise tiers of Amplitude's product offerings
4. Extending the Query product with direct database access

Amplitude SQL bridges the gap between Amplitude's user-friendly interface and more technical data exploration, allowing data analysts to perform custom analyses while still using Amplitude's visualization tools.

## Technical Details

### Amplitude SQL

- **Database**: Queries execute against a Snowflake database
- **Data Refresh**: Data loads into the SQL environment every 30 minutes
- **Export Limit**: Results limited to 1,000 rows for export
- **Primary Table**: `$events` contains the core event data

### SQL Schema Structure

The `$events` table includes columns such as:
- `amplitude_id` (STRING)
- `user_id` (STRING)
- `device_id` (STRING)
- `event_type` (STRING)
- `event_time` (TIMESTAMP_NTZ)
- `client_event_time` (TIMESTAMP_NTZ)
- `event_properties` (VARIANT)
- `user_properties` (VARIANT)
- `group_properties` (VARIANT)
- Various device information columns (platform, os, device_family, etc.)

### Query Shortcuts

Special field shortcuts available:
- `$date`: Simplifies date-based queries
- `$events`: References the main events table
- `$amplitude_id`: Handles merged user identities correctly

These technical features enable advanced analytics while maintaining integration with Amplitude's visualization capabilities.
