## Amplitude Analytics Platform - Other Charts Collection

This specialized collection within Amplitude's analytics platform provides advanced querying capabilities and user-centric analysis tools that extend beyond standard event-based analytics, offering direct database access and user property analysis.

## Product Relationships and Features

The collection encompasses three interconnected analytical capabilities that work together to provide comprehensive data access:

**Amplitude SQL** functions as the platform's custom query engine, providing direct SQL access to event data stored in Snowflake databases. This bridges Amplitude's visual analytics interface with raw data access, enabling complex custom analyses impossible through standard chart types. It operates with approximately 30-minute data loading intervals and requires Growth Enterprise plans with Query add-on.

**User Composition charts** deliver user-centric analysis focused on user properties and segments rather than event behaviors. These charts analyze active users independently of specific events, complementing event-driven analytics with demographic and characteristic insights.

**SQL Schema documentation** serves as the technical reference for underlying data structures, enabling effective utilization of SQL querying capabilities across the platform.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Data Architecture:**
- **$events table**: Primary data repository containing all event records with 30+ standardized columns
- **amplitude_id**: Persistent unique user identifier across sessions and devices
- **event_time**: UTC timestamp marking event occurrence
- **user_properties**: Custom user attributes accessed via `user_properties.property_name` syntax
- **event_properties**: Event-specific custom attributes accessed via `event_properties.property_name` syntax

**SQL Query Shortcuts:**
- **$date**: Simplified field for datepicker integration
- **$events**: Shorthand reference to main events table
- **$amplitude_id**: Simplified amplitude_id field reference

**User Analysis Terminology:**
- **Most Recent Value**: Analysis using latest property value per user
- **All Values**: Analysis incorporating all historical property values
- **Cross Property Values**: Multi-property user analysis
- **Mutually Exclusive Buckets**: Non-overlapping user segments for comparison

## Ecosystem Integration

These chart types integrate strategically within Amplitude's analytics ecosystem:

**Data Pipeline Architecture**: Amplitude SQL connects directly to Snowflake databases housing Amplitude data, positioning it as a bridge between real-time analytics and data warehouse capabilities. The 30-minute data loading interval balances freshness with system performance.

**Enterprise Feature Positioning**: SQL capabilities require Growth Enterprise plans with Query add-on, establishing this as an advanced feature for enterprise customers with sophisticated analytical requirements.

**Interface Integration Boundaries**: While supporting time series visualization within the platform, Amplitude SQL has documented incompatibilities with Portfolio Views, indicating specific integration constraints within the broader Amplitude interface.

**Complementary Analysis Framework**: User Composition charts provide user-centric perspectives that complement event-based analytics, enabling comprehensive analytical coverage when combined with standard behavioral charts.

## Technical Implementation

**SQL Query Infrastructure:**
- Direct Snowflake database querying using standard SQL syntax
- Simplified schema with shorthand references ($events, $amplitude_id, $date)
- VARIANT data type support for flexible property storage
- Dot notation property access (user_properties.property_name)

**Comprehensive Data Schema:**
The $events table encompasses complete event tracking including:
- Temporal fields: event_time, client_event_time, server_received_time
- User identification: amplitude_id, user_id, uuid
- Device metadata: device_brand, device_family, device_model
- Session tracking: session_id
- Geographic data: location_lat, location_lng
- Advertising identifiers: adid, idfa
- Custom properties as VARIANT types

**User Analysis Capabilities:**
- Event-independent active user analysis
- Property-based segmentation displaying up to 13 top values
- Multiple measurement methodologies for diverse analytical approaches
- Integration with standard Amplitude modules: Composition By, Segment By, and Measured As

This collection represents Amplitude's advanced analytics tier, providing enterprise-grade data access and specialized user analysis capabilities that extend the platform's core event-tracking functionality into comprehensive business intelligence territory.
