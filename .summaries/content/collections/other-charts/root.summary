## Amplitude Analytics Platform - Advanced Chart Collection

The "other-charts" collection represents Amplitude's enterprise-grade analytical tools that extend beyond standard event tracking, providing direct database access and user-centric analysis capabilities. This collection includes **Amplitude SQL** for custom querying and **User Composition charts** for property-based user analysis, both designed to complement Amplitude's core event-driven analytics with advanced data exploration features.

## Product Relationships and Feature Architecture

**Amplitude SQL** functions as the primary bridge between Amplitude's guided analytics interface and raw data exploration, offering direct SQL access to event data stored in Snowflake databases. This feature enables analysts to perform complex queries beyond the constraints of pre-built chart types while maintaining integration with Amplitude's visualization and export systems.

**User Composition charts** provide a complementary analytical perspective by focusing on user properties rather than event behaviors. These charts analyze active users based on property values using three distinct measurement approaches: Most Recent Value (latest property value per user), All Values (complete historical property data), and Cross Property Values (multi-property relationship analysis).

Both chart types integrate seamlessly with Amplitude's broader ecosystem, supporting consistent time series visualizations, data tables, and CSV exports while maintaining the platform's standard UI patterns and data governance frameworks.

## Core Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**$events table**: A simplified, flattened schema representation of Amplitude event data in Snowflake, featuring standardized field naming conventions and accessible user/event properties through dot notation access patterns.

**Field shortcuts**: Amplitude-specific prefixed fields ($date, $events, $amplitude_id) that provide automatic integration with platform UI components and handle complex data relationships transparently, including datepicker integration and user identity resolution.

**Merged users table**: An automated mapping system managing user identity resolution by connecting device_id and user_id relationships through amplitude_id mappings, ensuring consistent user tracking across sessions and devices.

**VARIANT data type**: Snowflake's JSON-like data structure used for storing flexible event and user property data, accessed through `user_properties.property_name` and `event_properties.property_name` syntax patterns.

**User Composition analysis**: A methodology for analyzing user segments based on property values rather than event occurrences, supporting temporal analysis of user characteristics and cross-property relationship exploration.

## Ecosystem Integration and Data Pipeline

These advanced chart types operate within Amplitude's Growth and Enterprise tiers, requiring the Query add-on for SQL functionality. The data pipeline maintains approximately 30-minute latency from event collection to Snowflake availability, with UTC timezone standardization and millisecond epoch timestamp precision.

The integration architecture supports both guided analytics (standard Amplitude charts) and flexible exploration (SQL charts) while ensuring consistent data governance. Events flow from Amplitude's collection system into the simplified table schema, which abstracts complex data relationships while maintaining compatibility with user identity resolution and property management systems.

## Technical Implementation and API Patterns

**SQL Query Interface**: Supports standard SQL syntax enhanced with Amplitude-specific features including autocomplete for column names, automatic user merging through `$amplitude_id`, and integrated date filtering through `$date` field shortcuts.

**Data Access Patterns**:
- Direct table access via `$events` shorthand notation
- Property access using `user_properties.property_name` and `event_properties.property_name` prefixes
- Automatic VARIANT data type conversion handling
- Built-in support for `device_id`, `session_id`, and timestamp field relationships

**Export Capabilities**: CSV exports support up to 1000 rows, designed to encourage focused analysis and integration with external data processing workflows for larger datasets.

The platform maintains clear separation between guided analytics and flexible exploration while ensuring consistent user identity management and data governance across both analytical approaches, enabling enterprise teams to scale from guided insights to custom data science workflows within a unified platform.
