## Amplitude Advanced Analytics Suite

Amplitude's advanced analytics capabilities extend beyond standard event tracking through two specialized chart types: **Amplitude SQL** and **User Composition Analytics**. These tools provide direct database access and user-centric analysis for organizations requiring custom analytics beyond Amplitude's standard charting capabilities.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

**Amplitude SQL** serves as the primary custom querying interface, operating as a Query add-on for Growth Enterprise plans. It provides direct SQL access to Amplitude event data stored in Snowflake databases through a simplified one-table schema design. The system abstracts Amplitude's complex internal data structure into the queryable `$events` table, which consolidates all event data using Snowflake's VARIANT data types for flexible property handling.

**User Composition Analytics** complements Amplitude SQL by focusing on user property analysis rather than event-driven queries. This chart type analyzes users based on their attributes and operates through three interconnected modules:

- **Composition By Module**: Defines the target user property for analysis
- **Segment By Module**: Applies filtering criteria to create user segments
- **Measured As Module**: Determines property value calculation methodology

These components work together to provide comprehensive user segmentation and property analysis, creating mutually exclusive user buckets for clear analytical insights.

## Core Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Schema and Data Access:**
- `$events`: Shorthand reference for the consolidated events table containing all Amplitude data
- `$amplitude_id`: Special identifier field that automatically handles user identity mapping and merged user scenarios
- `$date`: Integrated timestamp field that interfaces with Amplitude's datepicker for consistent time-based filtering
- `merged_amplitude_id`: System field managing user identity consolidation when user profiles are merged
- `event_time`: Calculated timestamp derived from either client_event_time or server_received_time

**Property Access Patterns:**
- `user_properties.property_name`: Syntax for accessing user-level attributes
- `event_properties.property_name`: Syntax for accessing event-specific attributes
- VARIANT data types: Snowflake's flexible column format enabling JSON-like property data storage

**User Composition Measurement Types:**
- **Most Recent Value**: Utilizes the latest property value for each user in analysis
- **All Values**: Incorporates all historical values a user has maintained for a specific property
- **Cross Property Values**: Enables analysis of combinations across multiple user properties simultaneously

## Ecosystem Integration and Platform Positioning

The advanced analytics suite integrates deeply with Amplitude's broader platform architecture while extending capabilities through external data warehouse integration. Amplitude SQL requires Snowflake infrastructure and maintains a 30-minute data refresh cycle for near real-time analysis capabilities.

**Identity Resolution Integration:**
The `merged_amplitude_id` functionality demonstrates sophisticated integration with Amplitude's user identity resolution system, automatically managing scenarios where user profiles have been consolidated. This ensures data consistency across custom SQL queries and standard Amplitude analytics.

**Platform Compatibility:**
- Direct integration with Snowflake data warehouse infrastructure
- Seamless datepicker integration across custom SQL queries and standard charts
- Time series visualization support for SQL query results
- Growth Enterprise plan requirement with Query add-on activation

## Technical Specifications and Limitations

**API and Query Capabilities:**
- Direct SQL querying against the `$events` table structure
- Support for complex JOIN operations and custom analytical functions
- Integration with Amplitude's existing datepicker and filtering mechanisms
- Time series visualization capabilities for query results

**System Constraints:**
- Portfolio Views incompatibility with Amplitude SQL charts
- User Composition chart displays maximum 13 property values
- 30-minute data latency for SQL query results
- Growth Enterprise plan and Query add-on requirements

**Analytical Scope:**
The system provides dual analytical approaches: event-driven analysis through direct SQL querying and user-centric analysis through property-based segmentation. This architecture enables organizations to perform custom analytics while maintaining integration with Amplitude's standard analytics platform, supporting both real-time operational queries and historical trend analysis within the unified Amplitude ecosystem.
