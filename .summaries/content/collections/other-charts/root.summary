## Amplitude Analytics Platform - Other Charts Collection

This documentation covers specialized chart types within Amplitude's analytics platform, focusing on advanced querying capabilities and user composition analysis tools designed for enterprise-level data exploration and visualization.

### Product Overview and Key Features

The "other-charts" collection encompasses advanced analytical tools that extend beyond standard event-based analytics:

**Amplitude SQL** - A powerful custom querying interface that enables direct SQL access to Amplitude data stored in Snowflake databases, providing enterprise users with unlimited flexibility for complex data analysis and custom visualizations.

**User Composition Charts** - Specialized visualization tools that analyze user segments based on user properties rather than event behaviors, offering insights into user demographics and characteristics across different property dimensions.

### Product Relationships and Feature Integration

**Amplitude SQL Integration**
- **Database Backend**: Leverages Snowflake as the underlying data warehouse
- **Schema Abstraction**: Provides simplified table shortcuts (`$events`, `$date`, `$amplitude_id`) that map to complex underlying database structures
- **Real-time Data Pipeline**: Maintains 30-minute data loading intervals for near real-time analysis
- **Enterprise Integration**: Requires Growth/Enterprise plans with Query add-on subscription

**User Composition Analysis**
- **Property-Based Segmentation**: Complements event-driven analytics by focusing on user characteristics
- **Microscope Integration**: Connects with Amplitude's user-level analysis tools for deeper investigation
- **Modular Architecture**: Utilizes Composition By, Segment By, and Measured As modules for flexible analysis configuration

### Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Database Schema Components**
- **`$events` table**: Core data structure containing all user interactions and properties
- **`amplitude_id`**: Primary user identifier that handles user merging and identity resolution
- **`merged_amplitude_id`**: Reference field for tracking user identity consolidation
- **VARIANT data type**: Snowflake's flexible JSON-like data structure for storing dynamic properties

**Field Shortcuts and Conventions**
- **`$date`**: Datepicker integration shortcut for time-based filtering
- **`$amplitude_id`**: User identification shortcut that automatically handles merged user scenarios
- **Property Prefixes**: `user_properties` and `event_properties` prefixes for accessing custom data attributes

**Measurement Types**
- **Most Recent Value**: Analyzes users based on their latest property value
- **All Values**: Considers all historical property values for each user
- **Cross Property Values**: Examines relationships between multiple user properties

**Temporal Data Fields**
- **`event_time`**: Client-side timestamp of when event occurred
- **`client_event_time`**: Original client timestamp before processing
- **`server_received_time`**: Server-side timestamp when event was received
- **UTC standardization**: All timestamps normalized to UTC for consistency

### Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

**Platform Architecture**
- **Snowflake Data Warehouse**: Serves as the centralized data repository for all Amplitude analytics
- **Query Add-on Licensing**: Represents premium tier functionality requiring additional subscription
- **Regional Limitations**: EU region currently unsupported for SQL functionality, indicating geographic data governance considerations

**User Identity Management**
- **Merged Users System**: Sophisticated user identity resolution that consolidates multiple user identifiers
- **Session Tracking**: Integration with session management for behavioral analysis
- **Device and Location Intelligence**: Comprehensive device fingerprinting and geographic data collection

**Visualization and Analysis Tools**
- **Time Series Capabilities**: Native support for temporal data visualization
- **Portfolio Views**: Integration limitations indicate specialized use cases for certain chart types
- **Segmentation Modules**: Modular approach to user analysis allowing flexible configuration

### Technical Implementation Details

**API and Query Interface**
- **SQL Syntax**: Standard SQL querying with Amplitude-specific shortcuts and functions
- **Schema Shortcuts**: Simplified table references (`$events`) that abstract complex underlying structures
- **Property Access Patterns**: Standardized prefixing system for accessing user and event properties

**Data Types and Storage**
- **VARIANT Fields**: Flexible JSON-like storage for dynamic property data
- **Advertising Identifiers**: Support for mobile advertising IDs (ADID/IDFA) for attribution analysis
- **Geographic Data**: Latitude/longitude storage for location-based analysis

This collection represents Amplitude's advanced analytics capabilities, providing enterprise users with both flexible SQL querying tools and specialized user composition analysis features that complement the platform's core event-driven analytics functionality.
