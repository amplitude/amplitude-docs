# Amplitude Analytics Product Suite: Other Charts and SQL Capabilities

## Product Overview

Amplitude is an analytics platform that provides tools for tracking, analyzing, and visualizing user behavior data. The "Other Charts" section of the documentation covers specialized visualization tools and SQL capabilities that extend beyond Amplitude's core analytics features. Key components include:

1. **Amplitude SQL** - A feature within the Query product that enables custom SQL queries against Amplitude data stored in Snowflake
2. **User Composition Chart** - A specialized visualization tool for analyzing user properties and segments

These tools help product teams gain deeper insights into user behavior, perform custom analyses, and better understand the composition of their user base.

## Product Relationships and Features

### Amplitude SQL

Amplitude SQL is part of the Query add-on product available to Growth and Enterprise plan customers. It provides:

- Direct SQL access to Amplitude data stored in Snowflake databases
- Custom query capabilities beyond standard Amplitude charts
- Visualization options for query results
- SQL autocomplete functionality
- Access to the `$events` table containing all event data

Amplitude SQL integrates with the broader Amplitude ecosystem by:
- Using the same underlying data as other Amplitude charts and analyses
- Providing a more technical interface for data analysts who need custom queries
- Supporting the creation of visualizations that can be saved to dashboards

### User Composition Chart

The User Composition chart is a specialized visualization tool that:
- Breaks down active users based on user properties
- Allows comparison between different user segments
- Provides insights into user demographics and characteristics
- Offers multiple viewing options (most recent values, all values, cross property values)

This chart complements other Amplitude visualizations by focusing on who users are rather than what they do, providing a non-event-driven analysis perspective.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Amplitude SQL Terms

- **$events table**: The primary table containing all event data in Amplitude's Snowflake database
- **$date**: A field shortcut that allows leveraging Amplitude's date picker UI
- **$amplitude_id**: A unique identifier for users in Amplitude
- **event_time**: Server-side timestamp when an event was received
- **client_event_time**: Client-side timestamp when an event occurred
- **variant data type**: A flexible data type in Snowflake that can store various types of data
- **event_properties**: JSON object containing properties associated with events
- **user_properties**: JSON object containing properties associated with users

### User Composition Terms

- **User property**: Attributes associated with users (e.g., demographics, preferences)
- **Most recent value**: The latest value of a property for each user
- **All values**: All historical values of a property across users
- **Cross property values**: Analysis across multiple properties
- **Active users**: Users who performed any activity in the specified time range
- **Segment**: A defined subset of users based on specific criteria

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude SQL and the User Composition chart fit into Amplitude's broader product ecosystem as specialized analysis tools:

1. They use the same underlying data as other Amplitude features
2. They complement standard event-based analyses with:
   - Custom SQL capabilities for technical users
   - User property analysis for understanding audience composition

Amplitude SQL specifically connects to Snowflake databases where Amplitude data is stored, providing a bridge between Amplitude's user-friendly interface and more technical SQL-based analysis.

## API Endpoints and Technical Details

### Amplitude SQL

- Queries are written against the `$events` table in Snowflake
- Data is loaded at 30-minute intervals (not real-time)
- Export limits: 1,000 rows maximum
- Query syntax follows standard SQL with Snowflake-specific features
- Example query format:
  ```sql
  SELECT event_type, COUNT(*) as count
  FROM $events
  WHERE $date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-01-31'
  GROUP BY event_type
  ORDER BY count DESC
  ```

### Schema Details for $events Table

The `$events` table includes numerous columns for analysis:
- **amplitude_id** (string): Unique user identifier
- **event_type** (string): Name of the event
- **event_time** (timestamp): Server-side timestamp
- **client_event_time** (timestamp): Client-side timestamp
- **event_properties** (variant): JSON object with event properties
- **user_properties** (variant): JSON object with user properties
- **platform** (string): Platform where event occurred
- **device_id** (string): Device identifier
- **session_id** (number): Session identifier

Additional columns include user demographics, device information, location data, and various tracking identifiers.
