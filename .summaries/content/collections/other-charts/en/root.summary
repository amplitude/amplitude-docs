# Amplitude Analytics Product Suite: Other Charts and SQL Capabilities

## Product Overview

Amplitude provides advanced analytics capabilities through specialized charts and SQL querying functionality. The "Other Charts" collection includes User Composition analysis tools and Amplitude SQL, which extends the platform's analytical capabilities beyond standard visualizations. These features enable users to perform deeper analysis of user behavior, segment properties, and custom data exploration through direct SQL access to their Amplitude data stored in Snowflake.

## Key Features and Components

### User Composition Chart

The User Composition chart is a specialized visualization tool that provides a breakdown of active users based on user properties. This non-event-driven analysis tool helps understand who users are and what properties they share across defined segments.

Key capabilities:
- Segment users based on a single user property
- Compare property distributions across different user segments
- View data in three modes:
  - Most recent value: Shows the latest property value for each user
  - All values: Displays all property values users have had during the timeframe
  - Cross property values: Analyzes relationships between multiple properties

### Amplitude SQL

Amplitude SQL is a feature within the Query product that allows users on Growth and Enterprise plans to write custom SQL queries directly against their Amplitude data stored in Snowflake.

Key capabilities:
- Write custom SQL queries using standard SQL syntax
- Access complete event and user data through predefined table schemas
- Visualize query results within the Amplitude interface
- Use SQL autocomplete for easier query writing
- Export results (limited to 1,000 rows)

## Relationship Between Products and Features

The User Composition chart and Amplitude SQL represent different approaches to data analysis within the Amplitude ecosystem:

1. **User Composition Chart**: Provides a structured, UI-driven approach to analyzing user properties and segments without requiring SQL knowledge.

2. **Amplitude SQL**: Offers advanced users direct access to their raw data for custom analysis beyond what's possible with pre-built charts.

Both features complement Amplitude's core analytics capabilities by providing different levels of analytical flexibility depending on user needs and technical expertise.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Amplitude SQL Schema

- **$events**: The primary table containing all event data
- **$date**: A special field shortcut that allows leveraging Amplitude's UI date picker
- **$amplitude_id**: A unique identifier for each user
- **event_time**: Server-recorded timestamp when an event occurred
- **client_event_time**: Device-recorded timestamp when an event occurred
- **variant data type**: A flexible data type used for event_properties and user_properties

### User Composition Terminology

- **User property**: Attributes associated with users (e.g., country, device type)
- **Segment**: A defined group of users based on specific criteria
- **Most recent value**: The latest property value for each user
- **All values**: All property values users have had during the timeframe
- **Cross property values**: Analysis of relationships between multiple properties

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude SQL integrates with the broader Amplitude ecosystem by:

1. Accessing the same data that powers other Amplitude visualizations
2. Allowing results to be visualized using Amplitude's charting capabilities
3. Supporting the Query add-on product for advanced analytics
4. Connecting to Snowflake as the underlying data storage system

The User Composition chart complements event-based analytics by focusing on user attributes rather than behaviors, providing a more complete picture of the user base when used alongside other Amplitude charts.

## Technical Specifications and Limitations

### Amplitude SQL

- **Data refresh interval**: Data is loaded into Snowflake every 30 minutes
- **Export limit**: Maximum of 1,000 rows can be exported
- **Table schema**: Comprehensive schema with columns including:
  - user_id, amplitude_id, device_id
  - event_type, event_time, client_event_time
  - platform, os_name, os_version
  - device_brand, device_manufacturer, device_model
  - country, region, city
  - event_properties, user_properties (as variant data types)
  - Various attribution and tracking columns

### User Composition Chart

- Focuses on user property analysis rather than event analysis
- Requires properly implemented user properties to be effective
- Provides filtering capabilities to focus on specific user segments

Both tools extend Amplitude's analytical capabilities beyond standard charts, enabling deeper insights into user behavior and characteristics through different analytical approaches.
