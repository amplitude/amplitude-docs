## Amplitude Analytics Platform - Other Charts Collection

This documentation covers specialized chart types within Amplitude's analytics platform, focusing on advanced analysis capabilities that extend beyond standard event-based analytics. The collection encompasses custom SQL querying, user property analysis, and database integration features designed for enterprise-level data exploration.

## Product Relationships and Features

The "other-charts" collection represents advanced analytical tools that complement Amplitude's core event tracking and analysis capabilities:

**Amplitude SQL** serves as the primary custom querying interface, enabling direct SQL access to event data stored in Snowflake databases. This feature bridges the gap between Amplitude's guided analytics interface and raw data exploration needs.

**User Composition charts** provide user-centric analysis capabilities that focus on user properties rather than event behaviors, offering a complementary perspective to event-driven analytics.

Both chart types integrate with Amplitude's broader visualization and export ecosystem, supporting time series charts, data tables, and CSV exports with consistent UI patterns across the platform.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**$events table**: A simplified, one-table schema representation of Amplitude event data in Snowflake, featuring flattened user and event properties with standardized field naming conventions.

**Field shortcuts**: Special prefixed fields ($date, $events, $amplitude_id) that provide automatic integration with Amplitude's UI components like datepickers and handle complex data relationships transparently.

**Merged users table**: A mapping system that handles user identity resolution, automatically connecting device_id and user_id relationships through amplitude_id mappings.

**User Composition analysis**: A methodology for analyzing active users based on property values rather than event occurrences, supporting three measurement approaches:
- **Most Recent Value**: Uses the latest property value for each user
- **All Values**: Includes all historical property values
- **Cross Property Values**: Analyzes relationships between multiple properties

**VARIANT data type**: Snowflake's JSON-like data structure used for storing flexible event and user property data, accessed through dot notation in SQL queries.

## Ecosystem Integration

These chart types operate within Amplitude's Growth and Enterprise tier offerings, requiring the Query add-on for SQL functionality. The integration points include:

**Data Pipeline**: Events flow from Amplitude's collection system into Snowflake databases with approximately 30-minute latency, maintaining UTC timezone standardization and millisecond epoch timestamp precision.

**Visualization Layer**: Results integrate with Amplitude's standard charting infrastructure, supporting both tabular data display and time series visualizations with consistent export capabilities.

**Schema Management**: The simplified table schema abstracts complex data relationships while maintaining compatibility with Amplitude's user identity resolution and property management systems.

## Technical Implementation

**SQL Query Interface**: Supports standard SQL syntax with Amplitude-specific enhancements including autocomplete for column names, automatic user merging through $amplitude_id, and integrated date filtering through $date field shortcuts.

**Data Access Patterns**: 
- Direct table access via `$events` shorthand
- Property access using `user_properties.property_name` and `event_properties.property_name` prefixes
- Automatic handling of VARIANT data type conversions
- Built-in support for device_id, session_id, and timestamp field relationships

**Export Limitations**: CSV exports are capped at 1000 rows, encouraging focused analysis and integration with external data processing tools for larger datasets.

The platform maintains separation between guided analytics (standard Amplitude charts) and flexible exploration (SQL charts), while ensuring consistent data governance and user identity management across both approaches.
