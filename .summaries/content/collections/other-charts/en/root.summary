## Amplitude Analytics Platform - Other Charts Collection

This documentation covers specialized chart types within Amplitude's analytics platform, focusing on advanced querying capabilities and user analysis tools that extend beyond standard event-based analytics.

## Product Relationships and Features

The "other-charts" collection encompasses three distinct analytical capabilities:

**Amplitude SQL** serves as the platform's custom query engine, enabling direct SQL access to event data stored in Snowflake databases. This feature bridges the gap between Amplitude's visual analytics interface and raw data access, allowing for complex custom analyses that may not be possible through standard chart types.

**User Composition charts** provide user-centric analysis capabilities, focusing on user properties and segments rather than event behaviors. This complements event-driven analytics by offering insights into user demographics and characteristics.

The **SQL Schema documentation** acts as the technical reference for the underlying data structure, enabling effective use of the SQL querying capabilities.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Data Structures:**
- **$events table**: The primary data table containing all event records with 30+ standardized columns
- **amplitude_id**: Unique user identifier that persists across sessions and devices
- **event_time**: UTC timestamp when the event occurred
- **user_properties**: Custom attributes associated with users (accessed via `user_properties.property_name` syntax)
- **event_properties**: Custom attributes associated with specific events (accessed via `event_properties.property_name` syntax)

**SQL-Specific Shortcuts:**
- **$date**: Simplified field for datepicker integration
- **$events**: Shorthand reference to the main events table
- **$amplitude_id**: Simplified reference to the amplitude_id field

**User Composition Terminology:**
- **Most Recent Value**: Analysis based on the latest property value for each user
- **All Values**: Analysis including all historical property values
- **Cross Property Values**: Analysis combining multiple user properties
- **Mutually Exclusive Buckets**: Non-overlapping user segments for comparison

## Ecosystem Integration

These chart types integrate with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem through several mechanisms:

**Data Pipeline Integration**: Amplitude SQL connects directly to Snowflake databases where Amplitude data is stored, with approximately 30-minute data loading intervals. This positions it as a bridge between Amplitude's real-time analytics and data warehouse capabilities.

**Plan Dependencies**: Amplitude SQL requires Growth Enterprise plans and the Query add-on, indicating its position as an advanced feature for enterprise customers with complex analytical needs.

**Visualization Compatibility**: While Amplitude SQL supports time series visualization within the platform, it has noted incompatibilities with Portfolio Views, suggesting specific integration boundaries within the broader Amplitude interface.

**User Analysis Framework**: User Composition charts complement event-based analytics by providing user-centric views, enabling a complete analytical picture when combined with standard behavioral charts.

## Technical Implementation Details

**SQL Query Capabilities:**
- Direct querying against Snowflake databases using standard SQL syntax
- Simplified table schema with shorthand references ($events, $amplitude_id, $date)
- Support for VARIANT data types for flexible property storage
- Custom property access through dot notation (user_properties.property_name)

**Data Structure:**
The underlying $events table includes comprehensive event tracking with fields for:
- Temporal data (event_time, client_event_time, server_received_time)
- User identification (amplitude_id, user_id, uuid)
- Device information (device_brand, device_family, device_model)
- Session tracking (session_id)
- Geographic data (location_lat, location_lng)
- Advertising identifiers (adid, idfa)
- Custom properties stored as VARIANT types

**User Analysis Features:**
- Analysis of active users independent of specific events
- Property-based segmentation with up to 13 top values displayed
- Multiple measurement approaches for different analytical needs
- Integration with Amplitude's standard Composition By, Segment By, and Measured As modules
