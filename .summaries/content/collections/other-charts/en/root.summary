## Amplitude Analytics Platform - Other Charts Collection

This documentation covers specialized chart types within Amplitude's analytics platform, focusing on advanced querying capabilities and user analysis tools that extend beyond standard event-based analytics.

## Product Relationships and Features

The "other-charts" collection encompasses three distinct analytical capabilities:

**Amplitude SQL** serves as the platform's custom query engine, enabling direct SQL access to event data stored in Snowflake databases. This feature transforms Amplitude from a standard analytics dashboard into a flexible data exploration platform, allowing users to write custom queries against the underlying event schema.

**User Composition charts** provide user-centric analysis capabilities, shifting focus from event-driven metrics to user property-based segmentation. This complements traditional event analytics by analyzing user characteristics and demographics rather than behavioral actions.

**SQL Schema documentation** acts as the technical foundation, defining the data structure and field mappings that enable both SQL querying and broader data integration workflows.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Data Structures:**
- `$events` table: The primary data table containing all event records with standardized column structure
- `$amplitude_id`: Unified user identifier that handles merged user profiles automatically
- `$date`: Special field shortcut that integrates with Amplitude's datepicker functionality

**User Identity Management:**
- `amplitude_id`: Primary user identifier with automatic merge handling
- `device_id`: Device-level tracking identifier
- `user_id`: Custom user identification field
- Merged users table: Backend system managing user identity consolidation

**Temporal Data Fields:**
- `event_time`: Canonical timestamp for event occurrence
- `client_event_time`: Client-side recorded timestamp
- `server_received_time`: Server ingestion timestamp
- `merge_event_time`: Timestamp for user merge operations

**User Composition Measurement Types:**
- Most Recent Value: Analysis based on latest property value
- All Values: Comprehensive analysis across all property instances
- Cross Property Values: Multi-dimensional property correlation analysis

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude SQL integrates with Snowflake's cloud data warehouse infrastructure, positioning Amplitude as both an analytics platform and a data access layer. The 30-minute data loading cycle ensures near real-time query capabilities while maintaining data warehouse performance standards.

The User Composition charts complement Amplitude's event-based analytics by providing user-centric perspectives, enabling cohort analysis and demographic segmentation that informs user acquisition and retention strategies.

Field shortcuts (`$date`, `$events`, `$amplitude_id`) create abstraction layers that simplify complex data relationships, particularly around user identity merging and temporal filtering, making advanced analytics accessible to non-technical users.

## Technical Implementation Details

**SQL Query Interface:**
- Custom SQL syntax with Amplitude-specific shortcuts
- Autocomplete functionality for column discovery
- 1000 row export limitation for result sets
- Integration with Growth Enterprise plan licensing

**Data Schema Structure:**
- One-table schema design for simplified querying
- VARIANT data types for flexible property storage
- Automatic user_properties and event_properties prefixing
- UUID-based row identification system

**Visualization Capabilities:**
- Data table results for detailed record inspection
- Time series chart generation from SQL results
- Integration with Amplitude's standard charting infrastructure

The platform requires Growth Enterprise plans for SQL functionality, indicating its positioning as an advanced analytics tool for sophisticated data analysis workflows.
