# Amplitude Analytics Product Suite: Other Charts and SQL Capabilities

## Product Overview

Amplitude is an analytics platform that provides tools for tracking, analyzing, and visualizing user behavior data. The "Other Charts" collection includes specialized visualization tools and SQL capabilities that extend Amplitude's core analytics functionality. Key features include:

1. **Amplitude SQL** - A query interface allowing direct SQL access to Amplitude data stored in Snowflake
2. **User Composition Charts** - Visualization tools for analyzing user property distributions across segments

These features enable advanced data analysis beyond standard analytics dashboards, allowing for custom queries, detailed user segmentation, and comprehensive property analysis.

## Product Relationships and Features

### Amplitude SQL

Amplitude SQL is a component of the broader Amplitude Query product, available exclusively to customers on Growth and Enterprise plans. It provides:

- Direct SQL access to Amplitude event data stored in Snowflake databases
- Custom query capabilities using standard SQL syntax
- Visualization options for query results
- Integration with Amplitude's UI features through special field shortcuts

The feature operates with certain limitations:
- Data is loaded into Snowflake at 30-minute intervals
- Export is limited to 1,000 rows
- Requires the Query add-on to the main Amplitude platform

### User Composition Charts

User Composition is a specialized chart type that:
- Breaks down active users based on user properties
- Allows comparison across defined segments
- Provides multiple viewing options (most recent values, all values, cross property values)
- Visualizes user property distributions in mutually exclusive buckets

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Amplitude SQL Terms

- **$events**: The primary table containing all event data in Amplitude's Snowflake database
- **$date**: A special field shortcut for date-based queries
- **$amplitude_id**: The unique identifier for users in Amplitude
- **event_time**: Server-recorded timestamp when an event occurred
- **client_event_time**: Device-recorded timestamp when an event occurred
- **variant data type**: A flexible data type in Snowflake that can store various property values
- **field shortcuts**: Special fields (prefixed with $) that enable Amplitude UI features

### User Composition Terms

- **Most recent value**: Analysis based on the latest property value for each user
- **All values**: Analysis including all property values a user has had during the timeframe
- **Cross property values**: Analysis examining relationships between multiple properties
- **Mutually exclusive buckets**: Non-overlapping categories for user property values

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude SQL integrates with the broader Amplitude ecosystem by:

1. Providing direct access to the same data that powers other Amplitude visualizations
2. Supporting the same user and event property structure used throughout the platform
3. Enabling custom analysis that can complement standard Amplitude charts
4. Utilizing the same user identification system ($amplitude_id) as other Amplitude features

User Composition charts complement other Amplitude visualization tools by focusing specifically on user property distribution, while other charts might focus on event sequences, funnels, or retention metrics.

## API and Command Usage

### Amplitude SQL Query Examples

```sql
SELECT * FROM $events WHERE $date > '2023-01-01'
```

```sql
SELECT 
  event_type, 
  COUNT(*) as event_count 
FROM $events 
WHERE $date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-01-31'
GROUP BY event_type
```

The `$events` table schema includes numerous queryable fields such as:
- amplitude_id (VARCHAR)
- event_type (VARCHAR)
- event_time (TIMESTAMP_NTZ)
- user_id (VARCHAR)
- device_id (VARCHAR)
- event_properties (VARIANT)
- user_properties (VARIANT)
- platform (VARCHAR)
- os_name (VARCHAR)
- device_family (VARCHAR)

Users can access these fields using standard SQL syntax within the Amplitude SQL interface, which includes autocomplete functionality to assist with query construction.
