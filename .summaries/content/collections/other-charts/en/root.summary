## Amplitude Analytics Platform - Other Charts Collection

This documentation covers specialized chart types within Amplitude's analytics platform, focusing on advanced querying capabilities and user analysis tools that extend beyond standard event-based analytics.

## Product Relationships and Features

The "other-charts" collection encompasses three distinct analytical capabilities:

**Amplitude SQL** serves as the platform's custom query engine, enabling direct SQL access to event data stored in Snowflake databases. This feature bridges the gap between Amplitude's pre-built analytics and custom data exploration needs.

**User Composition charts** provide user-centric analysis capabilities, focusing on user properties rather than event behaviors. This complements event-driven analytics by offering insights into user demographics and characteristics.

The **SQL Schema documentation** acts as the technical foundation, defining the data structure and field mappings that enable both SQL querying and general data access patterns.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**$events table**: The primary data table containing all event records, accessible through simplified shorthand syntax in Amplitude SQL queries.

**Field shortcuts**: Predefined aliases that simplify common query patterns:
- `$date`: Handles datepicker integration and time-based filtering
- `$events`: References the main events table
- `$amplitude_id`: Manages user identification including merged user scenarios

**User Properties vs Event Properties**: Distinguished by prefixes in the schema:
- `user_properties`: Attributes associated with users (demographics, account info)
- `event_properties`: Attributes specific to individual events

**Measurement Types** for User Composition:
- **Most Recent Value**: Uses the latest property value for each user
- **All Values**: Includes all historical property values
- **Cross Property Values**: Analyzes relationships between multiple properties

**Merged Users**: Amplitude's system for handling user identity resolution, tracked through `merged_amplitude_id` fields to maintain data integrity when user identities are consolidated.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude SQL integrates with the broader Snowflake ecosystem, requiring the Query add-on for Growth and Enterprise plans. The 30-minute data loading cycle ensures near real-time access to event data while maintaining query performance.

The User Composition charts operate within Amplitude's standard analytics interface, utilizing the same user property infrastructure that powers segmentation and cohort analysis across the platform.

Portfolio Views integration is notably absent for SQL charts, indicating these tools are designed for individual project analysis rather than cross-project reporting.

## Technical Implementation

**API Access**: Amplitude SQL queries execute against Snowflake databases using the `$events` table schema, with VARIANT data types handling flexible event and user property structures.

**Time Handling**: Multiple timestamp fields support different analytical needs:
- `event_time`: Client-side event timestamp
- `client_event_time`: Original client timestamp
- `server_received_time`: Server processing timestamp (UTC)

**User Identification**: The system supports multiple identifier types including `user_id`, `amplitude_id`, advertising IDs (`adid`/`idfa`), and session tracking through `session_id`.

**Geographic Data**: Location tracking through `latitude`/`longitude` fields enables geographic analysis within SQL queries.

The platform restricts SQL functionality to specific geographic regions (EU unavailable) and plan tiers, indicating infrastructure and compliance considerations in the broader product architecture.
