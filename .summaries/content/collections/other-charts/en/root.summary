# Amplitude Analytics Product Suite: Other Charts and SQL Capabilities

## Product Overview

Amplitude is an analytics platform that provides tools for tracking, analyzing, and visualizing user behavior data. The "Other Charts" collection includes specialized visualization tools and SQL capabilities that extend beyond Amplitude's core analytics features. Key components include:

1. **Amplitude SQL** - A feature of the Query product that enables direct SQL querying against Amplitude data stored in Snowflake
2. **User Composition Charts** - Visualization tools for analyzing user demographics and properties
3. **SQL Schema** - Structured data organization for efficient querying and analysis

## Product Relationships and Features

### Amplitude SQL

Amplitude SQL is an advanced feature available to users on Growth and Enterprise plans as part of the Query add-on. It allows users to:

- Write custom SQL queries directly against their Amplitude data stored in Snowflake
- Access event data, user properties, and event properties through a structured schema
- Create custom visualizations based on query results
- Use SQL autocomplete functionality to assist with query writing

The feature integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem by providing a more flexible and powerful way to access the same data that powers other Amplitude visualizations.

### User Composition Charts

User Composition is a specialized chart type that:

- Displays breakdowns of active users based on user properties
- Allows comparison between different user segments
- Provides options for viewing most recent values, all values, or cross-property values
- Focuses on who users are rather than what they do (non-event-driven analysis)

This chart type complements Amplitude's event-based analytics by providing demographic and characteristic insights about the user base.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### SQL Schema Terms

- **$events**: The primary table containing all event data
- **$date**: A special field shortcut for date-based queries
- **$amplitude_id**: Unique identifier for users in the system
- **event_time**: Server-recorded timestamp when an event occurred
- **client_event_time**: Device-recorded timestamp when an event occurred
- **variant data type**: A flexible data type that can store different types of values

### User Composition Terms

- **Most recent value**: Shows the latest value of a property for each user
- **All values**: Shows all values a user has had for a property during the timeframe
- **Cross property values**: Shows relationships between multiple user properties
- **Active users**: Users who performed any event during the specified time period

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude SQL and the specialized charts integrate into the broader Amplitude ecosystem by:

1. Accessing the same underlying data as other Amplitude features
2. Providing alternative views and analysis methods for that data
3. Supporting the Growth and Enterprise tiers of Amplitude's product offerings
4. Extending the Query product's capabilities with direct database access

The SQL functionality specifically bridges Amplitude's user-friendly interface with more technical data exploration capabilities, allowing data analysts to perform custom analyses while still leveraging Amplitude's visualization tools.

## API and Technical Details

### Amplitude SQL

- **Database**: Queries are executed against a Snowflake database
- **Data Refresh**: Data is loaded into the SQL environment every 30 minutes
- **Export Limit**: Results are limited to 1,000 rows for export
- **Table Structure**: Primary querying is done against the `$events` table

### SQL Schema Fields

The `$events` table includes numerous columns such as:
- `amplitude_id` (STRING)
- `user_id` (STRING)
- `device_id` (STRING)
- `event_type` (STRING)
- `event_time` (TIMESTAMP_NTZ)
- `client_event_time` (TIMESTAMP_NTZ)
- `event_properties` (VARIANT)
- `user_properties` (VARIANT)
- `group_properties` (VARIANT)
- Various device information columns (platform, os, device_family, etc.)

### Query Shortcuts

Special field shortcuts are available:
- `$date`: Simplifies date-based queries
- `$events`: References the main events table
- `$amplitude_id`: Handles merged user identities correctly

These technical features enable advanced analytics while maintaining integration with Amplitude's visualization capabilities and user-friendly interface.
