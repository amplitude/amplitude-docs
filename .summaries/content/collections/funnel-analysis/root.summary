# Amplitude Funnel Analysis

## Overview

Amplitude's Funnel Analysis is an analytics tool for tracking and visualizing user conversion through predefined event sequences. It helps product teams identify drop-off points in critical user flows, compare conversion rates between segments, and discover behaviors driving successful conversions.

Key features include:
- Flexible funnel creation with multiple ordering options
- A/B testing for segment performance comparison
- Conversion drivers analysis to identify influential behaviors
- Multiple visualization options (conversion over time, time to convert)
- Advanced filtering and segmentation
- Optional steps for analyzing non-linear journeys

## Product Relationships and Features

### Funnel Building and Configuration
- Event sequence selection (up to 10 steps)
- Multiple ordering options:
  - "This Order" (default): events must occur in sequence but can have intervening events
  - "Any Order": events can occur in any sequence within the conversion window
  - "Exact Order": events must occur in exact sequence with no intervening events
- Conversion window settings (1-90 days)
- Event exclusion capabilities
- Optional steps for non-linear paths
- Ability to combine multiple events into a single step

### Analysis and Visualization Options
- Conversion view (default): shows step-by-step drop-off
- Conversion Over Time view: tracks trends
- Time to Convert view: shows conversion speed distribution
- Frequency analysis for repeat conversions

### Comparison and Segmentation
- A/B testing with statistical significance calculation
- Group-by comparisons with baseline selection
- Multiple event comparison within single steps
- User property segmentation
- "Hold properties constant" feature for tracking unique user-property pairs

### Advanced Analysis
- Conversion drivers to identify influential behaviors
- Integration with Pathfinder for exploring user paths
- Microscope feature for detailed drop-off analysis
- Compass integration for correlation discovery

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Funnel Step**: An event representing a stage in the user journey
- **Conversion Rate**: Percentage of users completing a step after completing the previous step
- **Drop-off Rate**: Percentage of users failing to progress to the next step
- **Conversion Window**: Maximum time allowed between first and last funnel steps
- **This Order**: Events must occur in specified sequence but can have other events between them
- **Any Order**: Events can occur in any sequence within the conversion window
- **Exact Order**: Events must occur in exact sequence with no intervening events
- **Hold Properties Constant**: Counts unique user and property pairs rather than just unique users
- **Optional Step**: A step not required for conversion but providing additional insight
- **Conversion Drivers**: Behaviors correlating with successful conversions or drop-offs
- **Baseline Segment**: Reference segment against which other segments are compared

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Funnel Analysis integrates with other Amplitude products:

1. **Pathfinder**: Explores common paths between funnel steps, especially for understanding drop-offs
2. **Compass**: Discovers correlations between user behaviors and funnel conversion
3. **Microscope**: Drills into specific drop-off points for detailed behavior analysis
4. **Cohorts**: Funnel results can create cohorts for further analysis or targeting
5. **Experiment**: A/B testing capabilities connect with Amplitude's broader experimentation platform

The tool is particularly valuable for analyzing onboarding flows, checkout processes, feature adoption sequences, and other critical user journeys.

## Technical Implementation Details

- **Event Timing Resolution**: Default one-second precision, with optional millisecond resolution
- **Segmentation Logic**: User property segmentation applies based on property value at first funnel step
- **Filter Application**:
  - Segmentation Module filters apply only to the first event
  - Individual step filters can be added in the Events module
  - Group-by filters apply to the first event by default
- **Conversion Attribution**: Uses first-touch attribution
- **Feature Availability**: Advanced features like A/B testing and Conversion Drivers available only on Growth and Enterprise plans
