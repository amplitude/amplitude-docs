Amplitude's Funnel Analysis is a sophisticated conversion tracking and optimization platform that enables product teams to analyze multi-step user journeys, identify conversion bottlenecks, and understand the behavioral drivers behind successful user flows. The product serves as a central component of Amplitude's analytics ecosystem, providing deep insights into user progression through defined sequences of events.

## Product Architecture and Core Components

The system is built around two foundational modules: the **Events Module** for defining funnel steps and conversion sequences, and the **Segmentation Module** for applying user filters and property-based analysis. This dual-module architecture supports complex funnel configurations with up to multiple steps, configurable conversion windows, and sophisticated counting methodologies that can track either unique users or unique user-property pairs.

The product integrates deeply with Amplitude's broader analytics suite, including **Pathfinder** for user journey exploration, **Compass** for correlation analysis, **Microscope** for cohort creation and conversion driver identification, and **Amplitude Experiment** for A/B testing integration. External integrations extend to push notification partners like Airship and Kahuna for retention optimization workflows.

## Event Sequencing and Ordering Capabilities

Funnel Analysis provides three distinct conversion order modes to accommodate different analytical requirements:

- **This Order**: Events must occur in the specified sequence, allowing for intervening events
- **Any Order**: Events can occur in any sequence within the defined conversion window
- **Exact Order**: Strict sequential ordering with no intervening events permitted

This flexibility enables analysis of both rigid user flows (like onboarding sequences) and more flexible conversion paths where step order may vary based on user behavior patterns.

## Advanced Comparison and Statistical Analysis

The platform offers multiple comparison methodologies for sophisticated funnel analysis:

**Compare Event** functionality allows up to three events per conversion step for direct performance comparison, enabling teams to test different user actions that might lead to the same conversion outcome.

**Group-by Comparison** provides baseline property comparisons with conversion percentage differences, allowing teams to understand how different user segments perform through the same funnel.

**A/B Testing Integration** includes statistical significance calculations with 95% confidence thresholds and p-value analysis, enabling data-driven decision making around funnel optimization experiments.

## Conversion Driver Analysis and Microscope Integration

The **Microscope** feature represents a key differentiator, identifying events and behaviors that correlate with successful funnel completion. This capability uses multiple statistical methods including Matthews correlation, Pearson correlation, and phi coefficient calculations to provide correlation scores and frequency metrics. This feature is available to Growth and Enterprise plan users and enables teams to understand not just where users drop off, but what behaviors predict successful conversion.

## Technical Configuration and Property Management

The system implements sophisticated property and filter management, applying Segmentation Module filters exclusively to the first funnel step while allowing individual event filters per step. The "holding property constant" feature fundamentally changes the counting methodology from unique users to unique user-property pairs, enabling session-based analysis through the `[Amplitude]Session ID` property.

**Temporal handling** includes timestamp rounding to the nearest second by default, with optional millisecond resolution for precise event ordering requirements. The system treats simultaneous events as potentially occurring in any order unless millisecond precision is enabled.

**Optional Step Configuration** allows middle funnel steps to be marked as optional using dotted line controls, enabling conversion tracking when users skip non-essential steps. This feature is limited to one optional step per funnel to maintain analytical clarity.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Conversion Window**: The time period within which all funnel steps must be completed for a user to be counted as converted
- **Lookback Window**: The historical period analyzed for user behavior patterns
- **First-Touch Attribution**: Attribution model that credits the earliest conversion path when multiple paths exist
- **Hold Properties Constant**: Counting methodology that tracks unique user-property pairs instead of unique users
- **Conversion Drivers**: Events and behaviors that show statistical correlation with funnel completion
- **Baseline Segment**: Reference group used for A/B testing and comparison analysis
- **Event Totals vs Unique Users**: Different counting methodologies that can significantly impact funnel analysis results

## Integration Capabilities and Data Export

The platform supports CSV data export for funnel results and integrates with dashboard filters for cross-chart analysis. Conversion over time metrics are available across different chart types, though with specific limitations for certain comparison modes. The system includes breakdown tables for detailed segment analysis and supports custom bucket configuration for time-based analysis.

**Inline event combination** allows for temporary chart-specific events without permanent storage, while hover tooltips with microscope functionality provide detailed user journey exploration capabilities. The system accommodates up to two segment group-bys maximum and includes specialized handling for simultaneous events through Historical Count filters and event deduplication logic.

## Ecosystem Integration and Workflow Optimization

Funnel Analysis serves as a central hub in the broader product optimization workflow, connecting conversion insights to actionable interventions through its integration ecosystem. The connection to push notification partners enables immediate action on identified drop-off points, while A/B testing integration allows for systematic optimization of conversion flows based on funnel insights.

The product's integration with Pathfinder enables teams to explore the broader user journey context around funnel performance, while Compass integration provides additional correlation analysis capabilities that complement the built-in Microscope functionality.
