# Amplitude Funnel Analysis

## Product Overview

Amplitude Funnel Analysis is an analytics tool that tracks and analyzes user conversion paths through predefined sequences of events. It helps businesses understand user navigation through critical paths, identify drop-off points, and determine behaviors that influence successful conversions. The tool offers multi-step conversion tracking with flexible ordering options, detailed drop-off analysis, segmentation capabilities, A/B test comparison, conversion drivers identification, time-based analysis, and multiple visualization options.

Primary use cases include optimizing user journeys, improving conversion rates, analyzing onboarding flows, and enhancing user experience.

## Product Relationships and Features

### Core Funnel Analysis Features

1. **Funnel Building and Configuration**
   - Event sequence definition (up to 5 steps)
   - Three ordering options: This Order, Any Order, and Exact Order
   - Optional steps for non-linear paths
   - Event exclusion capabilities
   - Customizable conversion windows

2. **Advanced Analysis Capabilities**
   - Combining multiple events into single funnel steps
   - Comparing multiple events within a conversion step
   - Holding properties constant to track unique user-property pairs
   - Optional step analysis for non-linear journeys
   - Conversion drivers identification

3. **Comparison and Segmentation**
   - Group-by comparison with baseline property selection
   - A/B testing with statistical significance analysis
   - User property segmentation
   - Event property value breakdown
   - Multiple segment comparison

4. **Visualization and Interpretation**
   - Conversion rate visualization
   - Time to convert histograms
   - Conversion over time trends
   - Frequency analysis between steps
   - Breakdown tables with detailed metrics

5. **Integration with Other Amplitude Tools**
   - Pathfinder for exploring user paths
   - Compass for discovering behavioral correlations
   - Microscope for detailed user-level analysis
   - Behavioral cohorts for targeted analysis

### Computation and Methodology

Amplitude uses specific methodologies for funnel computation:
- First-touch attribution for conversion tracking
- Unique user counting based on first step participation
- Segmentation based on user property values at the first funnel step
- Handling of simultaneous events within one-second windows (optional millisecond resolution)
- Specific filter application logic across funnel steps

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Funnel Order Types**
   - **This Order**: Events must occur in specified sequence, but other events can occur between steps
   - **Any Order**: Events can occur in any sequence within the conversion window
   - **Exact Order**: Events must occur in exact specified sequence with no other events between steps

2. **Conversion Metrics**
   - **Conversion Rate**: Percentage of users completing all funnel steps
   - **Drop-off Rate**: Percentage of users failing to progress to the next step
   - **Time to Convert**: Duration between first and last funnel step completion
   - **Conversion Window**: Maximum allowed time between first and last step

3. **Analysis Features**
   - **Hold Properties Constant**: Tracks unique user-property pairs rather than just unique users
   - **Group Conversions By**: Segments conversion data by specific property values
   - **Conversion Drivers**: Events correlating with successful/unsuccessful conversions
   - **Optional Step**: A funnel step not required for conversion completion

4. **Comparison Tools**
   - **Baseline Property**: Reference point for comparing group-by values
   - **Statistical Significance**: 95% confidence threshold for A/B test comparisons
   - **Correlation Score**: Metric indicating relationship strength between behaviors and conversions

5. **Visualization Elements**
   - **Microscope**: Hover view showing detailed conversion metrics
   - **Breakdown Table**: Detailed view of conversion metrics by segment
   - **Conversion Over Time**: Chart showing conversion trends across time

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Funnel Analysis integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics platform:

1. **Pathfinder**: Shows common paths users take between steps, identifying unexpected journeys not captured in predefined funnels.

2. **Compass**: Discovers behavioral correlations that might influence conversion outcomes.

3. **Microscope**: Provides user-level detail for funnel steps for deeper investigation into individual journeys.

4. **Behavioral Cohorts**: Funnel analysis results can create targeted user cohorts for further analysis or marketing campaigns.

5. **Dashboard Integration**: Funnel Analysis charts can be added to dashboards, with some limitations when using dashboard filters.

6. **Growth and Enterprise Plans**: Advanced features like A/B testing and conversion drivers are only available on higher-tier plans.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Technical Limitations

1. **Microscope Limitations**:
   - Not available when combining events inline

2. **Feature Compatibility Limitations**:
   - Group-by comparison unavailable with Conversion Over Time
   - Multiple event comparison incompatible with dashboard filters
   - Optional steps have limitations with certain metrics and visualizations
   - A/B testing only available on Growth and Enterprise plans

3. **Computation Constraints**:
   - Default one-second window for simultaneous events (millisecond resolution available)
   - Segmentation applies based on first step property values only
   - Maximum of 5 steps in a funnel
   - Specific handling of duplicate events within the same second

4. **Filter Application Logic**:
   - Segmentation Module filters apply only to the first event
   - Group-by filters apply to the first event by default
   - Individual step filters can be added directly in the Events module
