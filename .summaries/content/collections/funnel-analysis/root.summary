Amplitude's Funnel Analysis is a sophisticated conversion tracking and optimization platform that enables product teams to analyze multi-step user journeys, identify conversion bottlenecks, and understand the behavioral drivers behind user progression through defined sequences of events.

## Core Product Architecture and Features

The product is built around two primary modules: the Events Module for individual event configuration and the Segmentation Module for user-level filtering and grouping. Users construct funnels by defining starting events and subsequent conversion steps, with three distinct ordering modes: "this order" for sequential progression, "any order" for flexible completion, and "exact order" for strict sequential advancement without intervening events.

The platform provides comprehensive analytical capabilities including A/B testing with statistical significance calculations, conversion driver identification through correlation analysis (Matthews correlation, Pearson correlation, phi coefficient), and multiple visualization modes encompassing conversion over time analysis, time-to-convert histograms, and frequency analysis. Key performance metrics include total conversion rates, largest drop-off identification, and slowest conversion step analysis.

## Product Relationships and Ecosystem Integration

Funnel Analysis integrates extensively with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem through several interconnected features. The Microscope feature enables granular cohort creation and user-level conversion pattern analysis. Pathfinder integration facilitates exploration of user journeys beyond defined funnel boundaries. Compass provides correlation analysis to identify conversion influencing factors. The product connects with Amplitude Experiment for A/B testing workflows and supports integration with push notification partners including Airship and Kahuna for retention optimization strategies.

Chart controls enable inline event combination, comparison functionality across up to three events per conversion step, and breakdown table analysis. The system supports simultaneous comparison of up to two segment group-bys and provides CSV data export functionality for detailed analysis.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Conversion Order Modes**: Three distinct progression types - "This Order" requiring sequential event completion, "Any Order" allowing flexible step completion, and "Exact Order" enforcing strict sequential progression without intervening events.

**Conversion Window**: Configurable time period within which users must complete all funnel steps to qualify as conversions.

**Hold Properties Constant**: Advanced counting methodology that shifts from unique users to unique user-property pairs, enabling session-based funnel analysis using [Amplitude]Session ID.

**Conversion Drivers**: Statistically significant events and behaviors correlating with user conversions or drop-offs, identified through correlation analysis algorithms.

**Optional Steps**: Middle funnel steps that can be bypassed while maintaining conversion tracking, visualized with dotted line indicators.

**First-Touch Attribution**: Conversion computation logic utilizing the earliest qualifying event sequence for each user in the analysis period.

**Baseline Segment**: Reference group for A/B testing comparisons, with statistical significance calculated using 95% confidence intervals and p-value computation.

**Group-by Filters**: User-level segmentation applied to funnel analysis, with property values evaluated at the first funnel step and maintained throughout the entire funnel sequence.

## Advanced Technical Implementation

The system implements sophisticated statistical calculations including p-value computation, sample size requirements for significance testing, and correlation scoring algorithms for conversion driver analysis. Event timing is handled through timestamp rounding to the nearest second, with optional millisecond resolution available for precise event ordering requirements.

Segmentation behavior applies user property values from the first funnel step consistently across the entire analysis. Filter application follows specific hierarchical rules where Segmentation Module filters affect only the initial event, while Events Module filters can be applied to individual conversion steps. The platform supports Historical Count filters for precise event deduplication and conversion tracking accuracy.

## Product Ecosystem Positioning

Funnel Analysis operates as a central analytical component within Amplitude's product analytics suite, bridging conversion analysis with user behavior exploration, experimentation frameworks, and retention optimization strategies. The product supports tiered functionality across Growth and Enterprise plans, with advanced statistical analysis, conversion driver identification, and enhanced comparison capabilities available at higher service levels.

The platform handles complex analytical scenarios including simultaneous event processing, optional step configuration, and advanced segmentation logic, positioning it as a comprehensive solution for product teams requiring detailed conversion analysis and optimization insights within their user journey optimization workflows.
