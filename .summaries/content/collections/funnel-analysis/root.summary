# Amplitude Funnel Analysis

## Overview

Amplitude's Funnel Analysis is an analytics tool for tracking and analyzing user conversion through defined event sequences in products or services. It enables product teams to identify drop-off points in critical flows, compare conversion rates between user segments, and discover behaviors driving successful conversions.

Key features include:
- Multiple funnel ordering options (This Order, Any Order, Exact Order)
- A/B test comparison capabilities
- Event combination functionality
- Conversion driver identification
- Optional step analysis
- Property-based segmentation and filtering
- Time-based conversion analysis

## Product Relationships and Features

### Funnel Building and Configuration
- **Event Sequence Definition**: Create funnels with three ordering options:
  - This Order: Events must occur in sequence but can have other events between steps
  - Any Order: Events can occur in any sequence
  - Exact Order: Events must occur in exact sequence with no intervening events
- **Event Combination**: Merge multiple events into a single funnel step
- **Optional Steps**: Mark steps that aren't required for conversion but are tracked
- **Property Constant Holding**: Track multiple conversions by the same user

### Analysis and Comparison Tools
- **A/B Testing**: Compare conversion performance between segments
- **Group-by Comparison**: Analyze conversion differences across property values
- **Multiple Event Comparison**: Compare different events within a conversion step
- **Conversion Drivers**: Identify behaviors influencing conversion outcomes

### Visualization and Interpretation
- **Conversion Rate Visualization**: View drop-off analysis with visual indicators
- **Time-based Analysis**: Examine conversion over time and time to convert
- **Frequency Analysis**: Analyze event frequency between funnel steps
- **Breakdown Tables**: Access detailed metrics for deeper analysis

### Integration with Other Amplitude Features
- **Pathfinder**: Explore user paths after drop-offs
- **Compass**: Discover correlated behaviors affecting conversion
- **Microscope**: Perform detailed event-level analysis
- **Cohort Creation**: Generate cohorts from funnel segments

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Funnel Step**: An event or combined events representing a stage in the user journey
- **Conversion Rate**: Percentage of users completing a subsequent step after the previous one
- **Drop-off**: Users who completed a step but not the next one
- **Conversion Window**: Time period within which users must complete all funnel steps
- **First-touch Attribution**: Attributing conversions to the first occurrence of an event
- **Hold Property Constant**: Counting unique user and property pairs rather than just unique users
- **Optional Step**: A non-required funnel step tracked separately
- **Conversion Drivers**: Behaviors correlating with successful conversions or drop-offs
- **Correlation Score**: Metric showing how strongly a behavior associates with conversion
- **Simultaneous Events**: Events fired within the same second (or millisecond with enhanced resolution)
- **Baseline Segment**: Reference group for comparison in A/B testing

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Funnel Analysis integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics platform:

1. **Pathfinder**: After identifying drop-off points, explore actual paths users take after abandoning the funnel
2. **Compass**: Discover behaviors correlating with successful conversions
3. **Microscope**: Drill down into individual events within the funnel
4. **Cohort Creation**: Create cohorts directly from funnel segments
5. **Dashboard Integration**: Add funnel charts to dashboards (some advanced features may not persist)

## Technical Details

- **Millisecond Resolution**: Available for more precise event timing analysis
- **Computation Logic**: Uses first-touch attribution for funnel conversions
- **Segmentation Application**: User property segmentation based on values at the time of the first funnel step
- **Filter Application**: Segmentation Module filters apply only to the first event; individual step filters can be added in the Events module
- **Feature Availability**: Advanced features like A/B testing and conversion drivers available only on Growth and Enterprise plans
