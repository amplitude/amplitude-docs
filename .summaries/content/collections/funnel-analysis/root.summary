# Amplitude Funnel Analysis

## Overview

Amplitude's Funnel Analysis is an analytics tool for tracking and analyzing user conversion through defined event sequences in products or services. It helps product teams identify drop-off points in critical flows, compare conversion rates between user segments, and discover behaviors driving successful conversions.

Key features include:
- Multiple funnel ordering options (This Order, Any Order, Exact Order)
- A/B test comparison capabilities
- Event combination within steps
- Conversion driver identification
- Optional step analysis for non-linear paths
- Property-based segmentation and filtering
- Time-based conversion analysis with customizable windows

## Product Relationships and Features

### Funnel Building and Configuration
- **Event Sequence Definition**: Create funnels with three ordering options to match different user journey patterns
- **Event Combination**: Combine multiple events into a single funnel step to track alternative paths
- **Optional Steps**: Mark steps that aren't required for conversion but provide valuable analysis
- **Property Constant Holding**: Track multiple conversions by the same user with unique property combinations
- **Millisecond Resolution**: Capture precise event timing for accurate conversion analysis

### Conversion Analysis Tools
- **Conversion Drivers**: Identify specific behaviors that correlate with successful funnel completion
- **A/B Testing**: Compare performance between different user segments with statistical significance
- **Multi-Event Comparison**: Analyze multiple events within single conversion steps
- **Group-by Analysis**: Break down conversion differences across property values

### Visualization and Reporting
- **Drop-off Visualization**: See where and how many users abandon the funnel
- **Time to Convert Histograms**: Analyze how quickly users move through the funnel
- **Conversion Trending**: Track changes in conversion rates over time
- **Inter-step Frequency Analysis**: Understand behavior patterns between funnel steps

### Integration Points
- **Pathfinder**: Explore user paths after funnel drop-offs
- **Compass**: Discover behavioral correlations with funnel completion
- **Microscope**: Perform detailed user-level analysis of funnel participants
- **Cohort Creation**: Generate user segments based on funnel completion or drop-off

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Funnel Step**: An event or combined set of events representing a stage in the user journey
- **Conversion Window**: Time period within which users must complete all funnel steps
- **First-touch Attribution**: Method attributing conversions to the first occurrence of an event
- **Hold Property Constant**: Counts unique user and property pairs rather than just unique users
- **Group-by**: Segmentation method breaking down funnel performance by property values
- **Conversion Drivers**: Behaviors correlating with successful funnel completion
- **Optional Step**: A non-required funnel step analyzed in parallel
- **Baseline Segment**: Reference group for A/B test comparisons
- **Statistical Significance**: Calculated at 95% confidence level for meaningful conversion differences
- **This Order/Any Order/Exact Order**: Different modes for defining event sequence requirements

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Funnel Analysis integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics platform:

1. **Data Foundation**:
   - Relies on properly instrumented events and properties
   - Uses Amplitude's identity resolution for accurate user tracking

2. **Analysis Suite Connection**:
   - Complements Event Segmentation for different analytical perspectives
   - Feeds into Pathfinder for post-drop-off path analysis
   - Works with Compass to discover behavioral correlations

3. **Activation Capabilities**:
   - Creates cohorts based on funnel completion or drop-off
   - Supports data-driven product improvements
   - Integrates with experimentation workflows through A/B testing

4. **Collaboration Features**:
   - Allows saving and sharing funnel visualizations
   - Supports team-based analysis of conversion metrics

## Technical Implementation

- **Feature Availability**: Advanced features like A/B testing and conversion drivers require Growth or Enterprise plans
- **Computation Logic**:
  - Uses first-touch attribution for conversion tracking
  - Applies segmentation based on property values at the first funnel step
  - Handles simultaneous events within a one-second window by default
- **Limitations**:
  - Optional steps can only be middle steps
  - Some features have compatibility restrictions with combined events
  - Dashboard filters may not persist when switching between chart types

Funnel Analysis is accessed through the Amplitude analytics interface, where users can create, configure, and analyze conversion funnels to optimize critical user journeys.
