Amplitude's Funnel Analysis is a comprehensive conversion tracking and optimization tool that enables product teams to analyze user journeys through defined sequences of events, identify drop-off points, and understand what drives successful conversions versus user abandonment.

## Core Product Overview

Funnel Analysis charts track user progression through sequential steps in a product experience, measuring conversion rates between each step and providing insights into user behavior patterns. The tool supports multiple analysis modes including basic conversion tracking, time-based analysis, A/B testing, and advanced statistical correlation analysis to identify conversion drivers.

## Key Features and Relationships

**Chart Building and Configuration:**
The funnel creation process centers around the Events Module for defining sequential steps and the Segmentation Module for user targeting. Users can configure conversion order options (This Order, Any Order, Exact Order) to control how strictly the event sequence must be followed. The tool supports combining multiple events into single funnel steps through inline event combination, and allows marking middle steps as optional to create dual funnel visualizations.

**Analysis and Comparison Capabilities:**
The platform provides multiple comparison modes including A/B testing functionality for Growth Enterprise plans, baseline segment comparisons, and the ability to compare up to three events within a single conversion step. The Compare functionality integrates with group-by segment properties to show conversion percentage differences through microscope hover tooltips and breakdown tables.

**Advanced Analytics Integration:**
Funnel Analysis integrates deeply with other Amplitude features including Pathfinder for user journey exploration, Compass for correlation analysis, and Microscope for cohort creation. The Conversion Drivers feature uses Matthews correlation coefficients to identify behaviors that correlate with successful conversions or drop-offs.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Conversion Order Modes:**
- **This Order**: Events must occur in the specified sequence
- **Any Order**: Events can occur in any sequence within the conversion window
- **Exact Order**: Events must occur in exact sequence with no intervening events

**Counting Methods:**
- **Unique Users**: Standard user-based counting
- **Hold Properties Constant**: Changes counting to unique user-property pairs, enabling session-based analysis using `[Amplitude]Session ID`

**Statistical Concepts:**
- **First-touch Attribution**: Conversion attribution based on earliest qualifying event sequence
- **Conversion Window**: Time period within which funnel steps must be completed
- **Matthews Correlation**: Statistical measure used in conversion drivers analysis
- **95% Significance Threshold**: Statistical significance requirement for A/B testing

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Funnel Analysis serves as a central hub connecting multiple Amplitude capabilities. It feeds behavioral cohorts into retention analysis, integrates with push notification partners like Airship and Kahuna for re-engagement campaigns, and connects with Amplitude Experiment for A/B testing workflows. The tool supports CSV data export for external analysis and dashboard integration with filtering capabilities.

## Technical Implementation

**API and Configuration:**
- Segmentation Module filters apply only to first funnel events
- Events Module supports individual step filtering
- Group-by filters work with "holding property constant" functionality
- Millisecond resolution available for precise event ordering
- Historical Count filters for advanced event handling

**Data Processing:**
- Simultaneous events handled by rounding timestamps to nearest second
- Event property grouping with bucketing limitations
- User property segmentation applied specifically to first funnel step
- Conversion computation uses earliest/longest conversion selection logic

The platform handles complex scenarios like simultaneous events, property value segmentation, and various filtering combinations while maintaining statistical accuracy for conversion analysis and optimization workflows.
