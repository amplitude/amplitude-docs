# Amplitude Funnel Analysis Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude's Funnel Analysis is a powerful analytics tool designed to track and analyze user conversion through defined sequences of events in a product or service. It helps product teams identify where users drop off in critical flows, compare conversion rates between different user segments, and discover behaviors that drive successful conversions.

Key features of Funnel Analysis include:
- Flexible funnel creation with multiple ordering options
- A/B test comparison capabilities
- Event combination and comparison
- Conversion driver identification
- Optional step analysis
- Property-based segmentation and filtering
- Time-based conversion analysis

## Product Relationships and Features

Funnel Analysis in Amplitude consists of several interconnected features:

1. **Funnel Building and Configuration**:
   - Event sequence definition with three ordering options: This Order, Any Order, and Exact Order
   - Ability to combine multiple events into a single funnel step
   - Optional step marking for analyzing non-linear paths
   - Property constant holding for tracking multiple conversions by the same user
   - Millisecond resolution for precise event timing

2. **Conversion Analysis Tools**:
   - Conversion drivers feature to identify behaviors leading to successful conversions
   - A/B testing functionality to compare segment performance
   - Multiple event comparison within single conversion steps
   - Group-by comparison to analyze conversion differences across property values

3. **Visualization and Interpretation**:
   - Conversion rate visualization with drop-off analysis
   - Time to convert histograms
   - Conversion over time trending
   - Frequency analysis between funnel steps

4. **Integration with Other Amplitude Features**:
   - Pathfinder for exploring user paths after drop-offs
   - Compass for discovering behavioral correlations
   - Microscope for detailed user-level analysis
   - Cohort creation from funnel segments

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Funnel Step**: An event or combined set of events representing a stage in the user journey
- **Conversion Window**: The time period within which users must complete all funnel steps to be counted
- **First-touch Attribution**: Amplitude's method of attributing conversions to the first occurrence of an event
- **Hold Property Constant**: Feature that counts unique user and property pairs rather than just unique users
- **Group-by**: Segmentation method that breaks down funnel performance by property values
- **Conversion Drivers**: Behaviors that correlate with successful funnel completion
- **Optional Step**: A funnel step that isn't required for conversion but is analyzed in parallel
- **Baseline Segment**: The reference group against which other segments are compared in A/B testing
- **Statistical Significance**: Calculated at 95% confidence level to determine if conversion differences are meaningful
- **This Order/Any Order/Exact Order**: Three different modes for defining how events must occur in a funnel

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Funnel Analysis is a core component of Amplitude's analytics platform, designed to work seamlessly with other Amplitude tools:

1. **Data Collection Integration**: Relies on properly instrumented events and properties from Amplitude's data collection system
2. **Analysis Suite Connection**: 
   - Complements Event Segmentation charts for different analytical perspectives
   - Feeds into Pathfinder for post-drop-off path analysis
   - Works with Compass to discover behavioral correlations
3. **Activation Capabilities**:
   - Enables creation of cohorts based on funnel completion or drop-off
   - Supports data-driven decision making for product improvements
   - Integrates with experimentation workflows through A/B testing features

## Technical Implementation Details

- **Feature Availability**: Some advanced features like A/B testing and conversion drivers are only available on Growth and Enterprise plans
- **Computation Logic**: 
  - Uses first-touch attribution for conversion tracking
  - Applies segmentation based on property values at the time of the first funnel step
  - Handles simultaneous events within a one-second window by default
- **Limitations**:
  - Optional steps can only be middle steps, not first or last
  - Some features like microscope have compatibility restrictions with combined events
  - Dashboard filters may not persist when switching between chart types

The Funnel Analysis tool is accessed through the Amplitude analytics interface, where users can create, save, and share funnel visualizations to track critical user journeys and conversion metrics.
