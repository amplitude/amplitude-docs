# Amplitude Funnel Analysis Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude's Funnel Analysis is a powerful analytics tool designed to track and visualize user conversion through predefined sequences of events in a product or service. It helps product teams identify where users drop off in critical flows, compare conversion rates across different user segments, and discover behaviors that drive successful conversions.

Key features of Funnel Analysis include:
- Flexible funnel creation with multiple ordering options
- A/B test comparison capabilities
- Conversion driver identification
- Time-based conversion analysis
- Optional step configuration
- Event combination and comparison
- Property-based segmentation and filtering

## Product Relationships and Features

Funnel Analysis in Amplitude consists of several interconnected features:

1. **Funnel Building and Configuration**:
   - Event sequence selection with three ordering options: This Order, Any Order, and Exact Order
   - Ability to combine multiple events into a single step
   - Optional step marking for analyzing non-linear paths
   - Comparison of multiple events within a single conversion step
   - Property constant holding for tracking unique user-property pairs

2. **Conversion Analysis Tools**:
   - Conversion drivers feature to identify behaviors leading to success or drop-off
   - A/B testing functionality to compare segment performance
   - Group-by comparison to analyze conversion differences across property values
   - Multiple visualization options including total conversion, conversion over time, and time to convert

3. **Integration with Amplitude Ecosystem**:
   - Connection to Pathfinder for exploring user paths after drop-offs
   - Integration with Compass for discovering correlated behaviors
   - Microscope feature for detailed step analysis
   - Cohort creation from funnel segments for further analysis

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Conversion Window**: The maximum time allowed between the first and last step for a user to be counted as converted.
- **First-touch Attribution**: Amplitude's method of attributing conversions based on the first occurrence of an event.
- **Hold Properties Constant**: A feature that counts unique user and property pairs rather than just unique users.
- **Simultaneous Events**: Events that occur within the same second, which Amplitude can distinguish with millisecond resolution.
- **Optional Step**: A funnel step that isn't required for conversion, shown as a dotted line in visualizations.
- **Conversion Drivers**: Behaviors that correlate with successful conversions or drop-offs.
- **Group-by Comparison**: Analysis that shows conversion differences relative to a baseline property value.
- **Combine Events Inline**: Feature to temporarily merge multiple events into a single funnel step.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Funnel Analysis is a core component of Amplitude's analytics platform that works in conjunction with:

1. **Pathfinder**: After identifying drop-off points in a funnel, users can leverage Pathfinder to explore what paths users take instead.

2. **Compass**: This feature helps discover what behaviors correlate with successful funnel completion.

3. **Microscope**: Allows for detailed examination of specific funnel steps.

4. **Cohort Creation**: Users can create cohorts from funnel segments for further analysis in other Amplitude tools.

5. **Event Segmentation**: While Funnel Analysis focuses on conversion through steps, Event Segmentation provides complementary analysis of individual events.

## Technical Implementation Details

- **Millisecond Resolution**: Can be enabled for precise event ordering when events occur very close together.
- **Segmentation Application**: User property segmentation is based on the property value at the time of the first funnel step.
- **Filter Application**: Filters in the Segmentation Module apply only to the first event, while individual step filters can be added directly in the Events module.
- **Computation Logic**: Different ordering options (Any Order, This Order, Exact Order) use distinct computation methods for determining conversions.
- **A/B Testing**: Statistical significance calculations use a 95% confidence threshold and require adequate sample sizes.
- **Enterprise Features**: Some advanced features like Conversion Drivers and A/B testing are available only on Growth and Enterprise plans.

Funnel Analysis serves as a critical tool for product teams to understand user journeys, optimize conversion flows, and identify opportunities to improve user experience and business outcomes.
