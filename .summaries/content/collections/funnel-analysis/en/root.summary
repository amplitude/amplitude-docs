# Amplitude Funnel Analysis

## Product Overview

Amplitude Funnel Analysis is a powerful analytics tool designed to track and analyze user conversion paths through predefined sequences of events within a product or service. The tool helps businesses understand how users navigate through critical paths, where they drop off, and what behaviors influence successful conversions. Key features include:

- Multi-step conversion tracking with flexible ordering options
- Detailed drop-off analysis to identify friction points
- Segmentation capabilities for targeted user journey analysis
- A/B test comparison for measuring variant performance
- Conversion drivers identification to understand behaviors influencing outcomes
- Time-based analysis for understanding conversion speed and patterns
- Multiple visualization options for different analytical perspectives

Funnel Analysis is primarily used for optimizing user journeys, improving conversion rates, analyzing onboarding flows, and identifying opportunities to enhance the user experience.

## Product Relationships and Features

### Core Funnel Analysis Features

1. **Funnel Building and Configuration**
   - Event sequence definition with up to 5 steps
   - Three ordering options: This Order, Any Order, and Exact Order
   - Optional steps to analyze non-linear paths
   - Event exclusion capabilities
   - Conversion window customization

2. **Advanced Analysis Capabilities**
   - Combine multiple events into single funnel steps
   - Compare multiple events within a single conversion step
   - Hold properties constant to track unique user-property pairs
   - Optional step analysis for non-linear journeys
   - Conversion drivers identification

3. **Comparison and Segmentation**
   - Group-by comparison with baseline property selection
   - A/B testing for statistical significance analysis
   - User property segmentation
   - Event property value breakdown
   - Multiple segment comparison

4. **Visualization and Interpretation**
   - Conversion rate visualization
   - Time to convert histograms
   - Conversion over time trends
   - Frequency analysis between steps
   - Breakdown tables with detailed metrics

5. **Integration with Other Amplitude Tools**
   - Pathfinder for exploring user paths
   - Compass for discovering behavioral correlations
   - Microscope for detailed user-level analysis
   - Behavioral cohorts for targeted analysis

### Computation and Methodology

Amplitude employs specific methodologies for funnel computation:
- First-touch attribution for conversion tracking
- Unique user counting based on first step participation
- Segmentation based on user property values at the first funnel step
- Handling of simultaneous events within one-second windows (with optional millisecond resolution)
- Specific filter application logic across funnel steps

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Funnel Order Types**
   - **This Order**: Events must occur in the specified sequence, but other events can occur between funnel steps
   - **Any Order**: Events can occur in any sequence within the conversion window
   - **Exact Order**: Events must occur in the exact specified sequence with no other events between steps

2. **Conversion Metrics**
   - **Conversion Rate**: Percentage of users who complete all steps in the funnel
   - **Drop-off Rate**: Percentage of users who fail to progress to the next step
   - **Time to Convert**: Duration between first and last funnel step completion
   - **Conversion Window**: Maximum time allowed between first and last step

3. **Analysis Features**
   - **Hold Properties Constant**: Tracks unique user and property pairs rather than just unique users
   - **Group Conversions By**: Segments conversion data by specific property values
   - **Conversion Drivers**: Events that correlate with successful or unsuccessful conversions
   - **Optional Step**: A funnel step that isn't required for conversion completion

4. **Comparison Tools**
   - **Baseline Property**: Reference point for comparing group-by values
   - **Statistical Significance**: 95% confidence threshold for A/B test comparisons
   - **Correlation Score**: Metric indicating relationship strength between behaviors and conversions

5. **Visualization Elements**
   - **Microscope**: Hover view showing detailed conversion metrics
   - **Breakdown Table**: Detailed view of conversion metrics by segment
   - **Conversion Over Time**: Chart showing conversion trends across a time period

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Funnel Analysis is part of Amplitude's broader analytics platform, integrating with:

1. **Pathfinder**: Complements funnel analysis by showing the most common paths users take between steps, helping identify unexpected journeys not captured in predefined funnels.

2. **Compass**: Works alongside funnel analysis to discover behavioral correlations that might influence conversion outcomes.

3. **Microscope**: Provides user-level detail for funnel steps, allowing deeper investigation into individual user journeys.

4. **Behavioral Cohorts**: Funnel analysis results can be used to create targeted user cohorts for further analysis or marketing campaigns.

5. **Dashboard Integration**: Funnel Analysis charts can be added to dashboards, though with some limitations when using dashboard filters.

6. **Growth and Enterprise Plans**: Some advanced features like A/B testing and conversion drivers are only available on Growth and Enterprise plans.

## Technical Implementation Details

### API and Command Line References
While specific API endpoints aren't detailed in the documentation, the product appears to have integration capabilities with other Amplitude tools and dashboard systems.

### Technical Limitations

1. **Microscope Limitations**:
   - Not available when combining events inline

2. **Feature Compatibility Limitations**:
   - Group-by comparison isn't available with Conversion Over Time
   - Multiple event comparison isn't compatible with dashboard filters
   - Optional steps have limitations with certain metrics and visualizations
   - A/B testing is only available on Growth and Enterprise plans

3. **Computation Constraints**:
   - Default one-second window for simultaneous events (millisecond resolution available)
   - Segmentation applies based on first step property values only
   - Maximum of 5 steps in a funnel
   - Specific handling of duplicate events within the same second

4. **Filter Application Logic**:
   - Segmentation Module filters apply only to the first event
   - Group-by filters apply to the first event by default
   - Individual step filters can be added directly in the Events module
