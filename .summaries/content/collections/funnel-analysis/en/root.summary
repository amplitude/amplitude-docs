Amplitude's Funnel Analysis is a comprehensive conversion tracking and optimization tool that enables product teams to analyze user journeys through multi-step processes, identify drop-off points, and understand conversion drivers. The product provides sophisticated event sequencing analysis with flexible ordering options, statistical testing capabilities, and deep integration with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem.

## Core Product Architecture

Funnel Analysis operates through two primary modules: the **Events Module** for defining funnel steps and conversion sequences, and the **Segmentation Module** for applying user filters and property-based analysis. The system supports up to multiple funnel steps with configurable conversion windows, event property filtering, and various counting methodologies including unique users and unique user-property pairs.

The product integrates seamlessly with complementary Amplitude features including **Pathfinder** for user journey exploration, **Compass** for correlation analysis, **Microscope** for cohort creation and conversion driver identification, and **Amplitude Experiment** for A/B testing integration. External integrations include push notification partners like Airship and Kahuna for retention optimization.

## Key Features and Capabilities

**Event Ordering and Sequencing**: Three distinct conversion order modes accommodate different analysis needs:
- **This Order**: Events must occur in the specified sequence
- **Any Order**: Events can occur in any sequence within the conversion window
- **Exact Order**: Strict sequential ordering with no intervening events

**Advanced Comparison Functionality**: Multiple comparison modes enable sophisticated analysis:
- **Compare Event**: Up to three events per conversion step for performance comparison
- **Group-by Comparison**: Baseline property comparisons with conversion percentage differences
- **A/B Testing Integration**: Statistical significance calculations with 95% confidence thresholds and p-value analysis

**Conversion Driver Analysis**: The Microscope feature identifies events and behaviors correlating with conversions using Matthews correlation, Pearson correlation, and phi coefficient calculations, providing correlation scores and frequency metrics for Growth and Enterprise plan users.

## Technical Implementation and Configuration

**Property and Filter Management**: The system applies Segmentation Module filters exclusively to the first funnel step, while individual event filters can be configured per step. The "holding property constant" feature changes counting from unique users to unique user-property pairs, enabling session-based analysis using `[Amplitude]Session ID`.

**Temporal Handling**: Amplitude rounds timestamps to the nearest second by default, treating simultaneous events as potentially occurring in any order. Millisecond resolution can be enabled for precise event ordering requirements.

**Optional Step Configuration**: Middle funnel steps can be marked as optional using dotted line controls, allowing conversion tracking when users skip non-essential steps, with limitations of one optional step per funnel.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Conversion Window**: Time period within which funnel steps must be completed
- **Lookback Window**: Historical period for analyzing user behavior
- **First-Touch Attribution**: Attribution model using earliest conversion paths
- **Hold Properties Constant**: Counting methodology using user-property pairs instead of unique users
- **Conversion Drivers**: Events and behaviors statistically correlated with funnel completion
- **Baseline Segment**: Reference group for A/B testing and comparison analysis
- **Event Totals vs Unique Users**: Different counting methodologies for funnel analysis

## API and Technical Integration

The system supports CSV data export for funnel results and integrates with dashboard filters for cross-chart analysis. Conversion over time metrics are available across different chart types, with specific limitations for certain comparison modes. The product includes breakdown tables for detailed segment analysis and supports custom bucket configuration for time-based analysis.

Funnel Analysis charts support inline event combination for temporary chart-specific events without permanent storage, and provide hover tooltips with microscope functionality for detailed user journey exploration. The system accommodates up to two segment group-bys maximum and includes specialized handling for simultaneous events through Historical Count filters and event deduplication logic.
