Amplitude's Funnel Analysis is a comprehensive conversion tracking and optimization tool that enables product teams to analyze user journeys through multi-step processes, identify drop-off points, and understand conversion drivers. The product provides sophisticated event sequencing analysis with flexible ordering options, statistical testing capabilities, and deep integration with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem.

## Core Product Architecture

Funnel Analysis operates through two primary modules: the **Events Module** for defining funnel steps and the **Segmentation Module** for user filtering and grouping. The system tracks user progression through defined event sequences, computing conversions using first-touch attribution with unique user counting logic that selects either the earliest or longest conversion path per user.

The product supports three distinct event ordering modes:
- **This Order**: Events must occur in the specified sequence
- **Any Order**: Events can occur in any sequence within the conversion window
- **Exact Order**: Events must occur in precise sequence without intervening events

## Key Features and Capabilities

**Event Combination and Comparison**: Users can combine multiple events into single funnel steps using inline event combination, and compare up to three events within individual conversion steps through the Compare Event functionality. The system supports temporary chart-specific event combinations without permanent storage.

**Statistical Analysis and A/B Testing**: The platform provides built-in A/B testing capabilities for comparing funnel performance between user segments, including statistical significance calculations with 95% confidence thresholds, p-value computations, and improvement over baseline metrics. This functionality requires Growth or Enterprise plans.

**Conversion Driver Analysis**: The Microscope feature identifies events and behaviors that correlate with conversions or drop-offs using Matthews correlation, Pearson correlation, and phi coefficient calculations. This provides correlation scores, frequency metrics, and event property analysis to distinguish between causation and correlation.

**Advanced Configuration Options**:
- **Hold Properties Constant**: Changes counting from unique users to unique user-property pairs, enabling session-based analysis using [Amplitude]Session ID
- **Optional Steps**: Allows marking middle funnel steps as optional, enabling conversion tracking when users skip non-essential steps
- **Conversion Windows**: Configurable time windows for tracking user progression through funnels
- **Millisecond Resolution**: Precise event ordering for handling simultaneous events

## Technical Implementation

**API and Data Handling**: The system handles simultaneous events by rounding timestamps to the nearest second, with optional millisecond resolution for precise ordering. Event property filters can be applied at individual step levels, while Segmentation Module filters apply only to the first funnel event.

**Filtering and Segmentation Logic**: User property segmentation applies specifically to the first funnel step, using property values from when the initial event was triggered. The "holding property constant" functionality enables event property grouping and session-based funnel analysis.

**Chart Types and Visualization**: Multiple visualization modes include conversion over time analysis, time to convert histograms, frequency analysis, and striped bar drop-off visualization. The system provides takeaway metrics including total conversion rates, largest drop-off steps, and slowest conversion steps.

## Integration Ecosystem

Funnel Analysis integrates deeply with Amplitude's broader product suite:
- **Pathfinder**: For analyzing user paths and drop-off points
- **Compass**: For correlation analysis of conversion factors
- **Amplitude Experiment**: For A/B testing integration
- **Partner Integrations**: Airship and Kahuna for push notification optimization
- **Data Export**: CSV export capabilities for external analysis

## Nomenclature and Definitions

**Conversion Window**: Time period within which users must complete the funnel sequence
**Lookback Window**: Historical period for analyzing funnel entry points
**First-Touch Attribution**: Attribution model assigning conversion credit to the first qualifying event sequence
**Unique User-Property Pairs**: Counting method when holding properties constant, treating each user-property combination as distinct
**Conversion Drivers**: Events or behaviors statistically correlated with funnel completion or abandonment
**Baseline Segment**: Reference group for A/B testing comparisons
**Optional Step**: Non-essential funnel step that users can skip while still converting

The product serves as Amplitude's primary tool for conversion optimization, enabling product teams to understand user behavior patterns, identify optimization opportunities, and measure the impact of product changes on user conversion rates across complex multi-step user journeys.
