# Guides and Surveys API

## Product Overview

The Guides and Surveys API is a specialized set of endpoints designed for programmatic management of guides, surveys, and their translations. This API primarily focuses on localization capabilities, allowing users to import and export translation files in a standardized format (XLIFF 1.2). The product enables organizations to efficiently manage multilingual content for customer engagement tools, supporting global business operations that require localized content delivery across different regions and languages.

## Key Features

- **Localization Management**: Programmatically export and import translations for guides and surveys
- **XLIFF 1.2 Format Support**: Industry-standard translation file format compatibility
- **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple guides or surveys in a single API request
- **Multi-locale Support**: Process translations for multiple target languages simultaneously
- **Translation Management System Integration**: Seamless workflow with external translation tools
- **Automatic Cache Management**: System purges caches after translation imports to ensure content is updated

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Guides and Surveys API appears to be a component within a larger customer engagement platform. The API specifically handles the localization aspects of two primary content types:

1. **Guides**: Interactive content elements likely used for user onboarding, feature announcements, or contextual help
2. **Surveys**: Feedback collection tools for gathering user input and measuring satisfaction

The API serves as the bridge between the core platform and external translation workflows, enabling content creators to develop materials in a source language and efficiently localize them into multiple target languages.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **XLIFF (XML Localization Interchange File Format)**: The standardized XML-based format used for exchanging localization data
- **Source Language**: The original language of the content (specified as `source-language` in XLIFF)
- **Target Language**: The language into which content is being translated (specified as `target-language` in XLIFF)
- **Trans-unit**: Individual translation unit within an XLIFF file containing source text and its corresponding translation
- **Variants**: Different versions of text within the same translation unit, allowing for contextual variations
- **Localization**: The process of adapting content for specific regions or languages
- **Cache Purging**: Automatic clearing of stored content to ensure updated translations are displayed

## API Endpoints

The API currently offers two primary endpoints:

### Export Translations
- **Method**: GET
- **Authentication**: Basic Authentication
- **Purpose**: Retrieves translation files for specified guides/surveys and target locales
- **Output**: XLIFF 1.2 formatted files containing source text and existing translations

### Import Translations
- **Method**: POST
- **Authentication**: Basic Authentication
- **Purpose**: Uploads completed translations for guides/surveys
- **Input**: XLIFF 1.2 formatted files with translated content
- **Post-processing**: Automatic cache purging to reflect updated translations

## Integration Workflow

The typical workflow for using the Guides and Surveys API involves:

1. **Content Creation**: Developing guides and surveys in the source language
2. **Translation Export**: Using the API to export XLIFF files containing source content
3. **Translation Process**: Processing the XLIFF files in external translation management systems
4. **Translation Import**: Uploading the completed translations via the API
5. **Content Delivery**: Automatically updated multilingual content delivery to end users

## Product Ecosystem Context

The Guides and Surveys API appears to be part of a broader customer experience or digital adoption platform. The localization capabilities suggest that the product serves global businesses needing to provide consistent user experiences across different languages and regions. The API's focus on guides and surveys indicates that the platform likely specializes in user onboarding, feature adoption, and feedback collection.

## Technical Considerations

- The API is currently in Beta status
- Authentication is implemented via Basic Authentication
- The system automatically handles cache management after translation imports
- The API adheres to the XLIFF 1.2 standard for maximum compatibility with translation tools and workflows
