# Guides and Surveys API

## Product Overview

The Guides and Surveys API is a specialized set of endpoints designed for programmatic management of guides, surveys, and their translations. This API primarily focuses on localization capabilities, allowing users to efficiently import and export translation files in a standardized format (XLIFF 1.2). The product enables organizations to create, manage, and localize customer-facing content across multiple languages, supporting global customer engagement strategies.

Key features include:
- Localization support with XLIFF 1.2 format compatibility
- Seamless integration with external Translation Management Systems (TMS)
- Batch processing for multiple guides or surveys in a single request
- Support for multiple target languages in translation workflows
- Variant handling for context-specific translations

## Product and Feature Relationships

The Guides and Surveys API consists of two main components:

1. **Guides Management**: Enables the creation and management of interactive guides that likely serve as in-app tutorials, walkthroughs, or help content for end users.

2. **Surveys Management**: Provides functionality to create and manage customer feedback surveys.

Both components are unified by the **Localization API (Beta)**, which serves as the core translation management system. This localization layer enables both guides and surveys to be translated into multiple languages through a standardized workflow.

The relationship between these components is hierarchical:
- The Guides and Surveys API serves as the parent product
- Guides and Surveys are parallel feature sets within the product
- The Localization API is a cross-cutting service that supports both feature sets

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **XLIFF 1.2**: XML Localization Interchange File Format, the standardized format used for translation files that includes source text and translated content.

- **Source Language**: The original language of the content as specified in the XLIFF file.

- **Target Language**: The language into which content is being translated, specified in the XLIFF file.

- **Trans-unit Elements**: Individual translation units within the XLIFF file that contain both source and target text pairs.

- **Variants**: Different versions of the same text based on context, allowing for context-specific translations.

- **Guide**: Likely refers to interactive walkthroughs, tutorials, or help content presented to users within an application.

- **Survey**: Customer feedback collection tools that can be presented to users.

- **Cache Purging**: The process of clearing cached content after importing translations to ensure changes take effect immediately.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Guides and Surveys API appears to be part of a larger customer experience and engagement platform. Based on the documentation, we can infer:

1. The product likely integrates with broader customer experience management tools, enabling organizations to create interactive guides and collect feedback through surveys.

2. The localization capabilities suggest the product is designed for global enterprises that need to provide localized content to customers across different regions and languages.

3. The API's integration with Translation Management Systems indicates it's designed to fit into enterprise-level content workflows where translations may be managed by specialized teams or external vendors.

4. The focus on programmatic translation management suggests the product supports sophisticated, automated localization pipelines rather than manual translation processes.

## API Endpoints

The API includes the following key endpoints:

### Import Translations
- **Method**: POST
- **Authentication**: Basic Authentication
- **Functionality**: Imports translations from XLIFF 1.2 files
- **Request Body**: XLIFF 1.2 formatted file containing translations

### Export Translations
- **Method**: GET
- **Authentication**: Basic Authentication
- **Functionality**: Exports translations to XLIFF 1.2 files
- **Parameters**: Supports specifying multiple guides/surveys and target locales

While specific URL patterns are not provided in the documentation, these endpoints form the core of the localization workflow, enabling a round-trip process for managing translations of guides and surveys.
