# Guides and Surveys API

## Overview

The Guides and Surveys API is a programmatic interface for managing and localizing guides and surveys content. It provides robust capabilities for translating content through integration with external translation management systems, making it ideal for global businesses that need to deliver content in multiple languages.

## Key Features and Capabilities

- **Content Management**: Programmatically manage guides and surveys content
- **Localization Support**: Import and export translation files in XLIFF 1.2 format
- **External Integration**: Seamless connection with third-party translation management systems
- **Multilingual Content**: Support for multiple languages and regional variants
- **Automated Cache Management**: Automatic cache purging after translation imports

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Guides and Surveys API appears to be a component within a larger customer engagement platform. It specifically handles the content management and localization aspects of guides and surveys, which are likely customer-facing content types used for:

1. User onboarding and education (guides)
2. Feedback collection and user research (surveys)

The API serves as a bridge between the main content creation platform and external translation services, enabling a streamlined workflow for multilingual content delivery.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Guides**: Instructional content that helps users navigate and understand product features
- **Surveys**: Interactive content for collecting user feedback and data
- **Localization**: The process of adapting content for specific languages and regions
- **XLIFF 1.2**: XML Localization Interchange File Format, the standard format for exchanging translation data
- **Source Language**: The original language of content before translation
- **Target Language**: The language into which content is being translated
- **Trans-unit**: Individual translatable text units within the XLIFF format
- **Language Variants**: Regional variations of languages (e.g., en-US, en-GB)

## API Endpoints and Authentication

### Authentication
The API uses Basic Authentication with:
- **App ID** (used as username)
- **App Secret Key** (used as password)

### Key Endpoints
- **Import Translations**: `POST` request to import translated content
- **Export Translations**: `GET` request to export content for translation

## Integration Ecosystem

The Guides and Surveys API integrates with:

1. **Content Management Systems**: Where guides and surveys are initially created
2. **Translation Management Systems**: External services that facilitate the translation process
3. **Content Delivery Systems**: Where the translated content is ultimately presented to users

The workflow typically follows these steps:
1. Content is created in the primary system
2. Content is exported via the API for translation
3. Translated content is imported back via the API
4. Cache is automatically purged to make new translations immediately available
5. Multilingual content is delivered to end users

## Technical Requirements

- Support for XLIFF 1.2 format processing
- Capability to make authenticated HTTP requests
- Understanding of ISO language codes and regional variants
- Integration capabilities with translation management systems

The API is currently in Beta status for its Localization features, suggesting ongoing development and potential for additional capabilities in future releases.
