## Guides and Surveys Localization API

The Guides and Surveys Localization API is a Beta-stage REST API that enables programmatic translation management for LaunchDarkly's guides and surveys functionality. This specialized localization service facilitates seamless integration with translation management systems (TMS) through standardized XLIFF 1.2 file format support, allowing organizations to manage multilingual user experiences at scale.

## Core Features and Capabilities

The API delivers comprehensive localization workflow support through several key capabilities:

**XLIFF 1.2 Translation File Management** provides industry-standard import and export functionality for translation files, ensuring compatibility with existing enterprise translation workflows. **Programmatic Translation Workflows** enable automated integration with external translation management systems, reducing manual overhead in multilingual content management.

**Multi-language Content Support** handles complex source and target language configurations, while **Feature Flag Integration** creates direct mapping between translations and LaunchDarkly feature flags through flag_key parameters, ensuring translated content aligns with feature flag variations and experiments.

## Product Relationships and Feature Architecture

The Guides and Surveys Localization API functions as a specialized component within LaunchDarkly's feature flag ecosystem, specifically handling the internationalization layer for user-facing guides and surveys controlled by feature flags. The API creates a critical bridge between LaunchDarkly's experimentation platform and external translation workflows.

The architectural relationship follows a hierarchical structure where **Feature Flags** (identified by flag_key) contain multiple **Variants** representing different configurations of guides and surveys. **Trans-units** within XLIFF files map to specific translatable elements, while **Target/Source Languages** define translation direction and locale support. This structure enables organizations to maintain translation consistency across different user segments and experimental variations.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Flag Key** serves as the unique identifier for LaunchDarkly feature flags that control guide and survey display logic. **Variant Identifier** specifies particular versions or configurations of guides/surveys within a feature flag context.

**Trans-unit Elements** represent individual translatable segments within XLIFF files, containing both source and target text mappings. **XLIFF 1.2** refers to the XML Localization Interchange File Format standard used for translation file exchange between systems.

**Nudge Translations** define specific types of user interface prompts or guidance messages requiring localization. **Original Attribute Mapping** maintains relationships between source content and translated versions, ensuring content integrity across languages.

**Cache Purging** describes the process of clearing stored translation data to ensure updated content delivery, while **Target-language/Source-language Codes** utilize ISO language codes to define translation pairs and locale specifications.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Within LaunchDarkly's comprehensive product ecosystem, this API serves as the critical localization bridge for user-facing content controlled by feature flags. The integration enables organizations to maintain consistent multilingual experiences across feature flag variations while leveraging LaunchDarkly's experimentation capabilities with enterprise translation workflows.

The API facilitates scaling international product releases through automated translation management and ensures translation consistency across different user segments and experiments. This positioning allows organizations to combine LaunchDarkly's feature flag management with sophisticated multilingual content delivery strategies.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

The API operates under the base path `guides-surveys/api/v1/localization` and implements RESTful endpoints specifically designed for TMS system integration. **Authentication** utilizes Basic Authentication with App ID and App Secret Key credentials, providing secure access to translation management functions.

**File Format** requirements enforce strict XLIFF 1.2 compliance for translation file structure, ensuring compatibility with industry-standard translation tools. The **Integration Pattern** follows RESTful principles optimized for automated translation workflow integration.

**Caching Strategy** includes built-in cache management for translation delivery optimization, with cache purging capabilities to ensure content freshness. The API's Beta status indicates active development with potential breaking changes, positioning it as an evolving solution for organizations requiring sophisticated multilingual feature flag management capabilities.
