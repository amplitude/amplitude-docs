## Guides and Surveys Localization API

The Guides and Surveys Localization API is a beta REST service that enables programmatic translation management for guides and surveys content. Built around industry-standard XLIFF 1.2 format, the API serves as a bridge between internal content systems and external translation management platforms, facilitating automated localization workflows for multi-language content delivery.

## Core Features and Architecture

The API provides comprehensive localization capabilities through XLIFF 1.2 translation file management, supporting both export of translatable content and import of completed translations. The service implements programmatic translation workflows that enable seamless integration with third-party translation management systems, while supporting multi-language content operations with proper source and target language mapping using ISO-standard language codes.

Content variant management allows handling of multiple content versions through flag_key and variant identifier mapping, providing granular control over different content iterations. The system includes automatic cache management with purging mechanisms to ensure content freshness across the localization pipeline.

## Product Relationships and Integration Points

The API operates as a specialized component within a broader content management ecosystem, facilitating bidirectional content flow between internal guides/surveys systems and external translation platforms. It enables content extraction for translation purposes, manages translation integration workflows, and maintains content synchronization between development and localization teams.

The service supports integration with existing translation workflows, allowing organizations to incorporate guides and surveys content into established localization processes while maintaining consistency across multi-language content deployments.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**flag_key**: Primary identifier parameter that maps to specific guide or survey content instances, serving as the core reference for content retrieval and management operations.

**variant**: Secondary identifier specifying particular versions or variations of content associated with a flag_key, enabling granular content version management.

**trans-unit elements**: XLIFF-standard translation units containing translatable content segments, structured with source and target language mappings for translation workflow processing.

**nudge translations**: Specialized translatable content type related to user interface prompts and guidance messages within the guides and surveys system.

**original attribute mapping**: XLIFF metadata maintaining traceability between translated content and source material through structured attribute relationships.

**target-language codes**: ISO-standard language identifiers specifying destination languages for translation operations.

**source-language codes**: ISO-standard language identifiers specifying original content language for translation processing.

## API Structure and Authentication

**Base Endpoint**: `guides-surveys/api/v1/localization`

**Authentication**: Basic Authentication using App ID and App Secret Key credentials for secure API access.

**Primary Operations**:
- Translation file export for extracting translatable content in XLIFF 1.2 format
- Translation file import for updating content with completed translations
- Cache purging operations for content synchronization and freshness

## Ecosystem Position

The API functions as a critical localization infrastructure component, enabling organizations to automate translation processes through programmatic interfaces while maintaining integration with existing translation management systems. The beta designation indicates active development with ongoing feature expansion and API refinement based on integration requirements and user feedback.

The service supports enterprise localization workflows by providing standardized XLIFF format compatibility, ensuring interoperability with established translation tools and processes while maintaining content integrity across multi-language deployments.
