## Overview

The Guides and Surveys API is a platform for programmatically managing guides and surveys with robust localization capabilities. It enables organizations to create, manage, and translate content across multiple languages, making it ideal for global enterprises that need to deliver localized user experiences to their customers.

## Key Features and Capabilities

- **Multi-locale Support**: Handle multiple guides/surveys and locales simultaneously
- **Translation Workflow Integration**: Seamlessly connect with external translation management systems
- **Variant Support**: Manage content variations specific to different locales
- **Automatic Cache Management**: System automatically purges caches after translation imports

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **XLIFF 1.2**: XML Localization Interchange File Format, the standard format used for translation exchange
- **trans-unit elements**: XML components that contain the translatable content
- **source-language**: The original language of the content being translated

- **Locale**: A specific language and regional variant combination (e.g., en-US, fr-FR)
- **Variant**: Content variations specific to different locales or regions
- **Basic Authentication**: The authentication method used to secure API access

## API Endpoints and Integration

### Localization API (Beta)

   - Method: GET
   - Authentication: Basic Authentication
   - Format: Returns XLIFF 1.2 formatted content
   - Purpose: Extract content for translation by external systems

2. **Import Translations**

   - Authentication: Basic Authentication
   - Format: Accepts XLIFF 1.2 formatted content
   - Purpose: Import translated content back into the system

### Integration Workflow

The typical workflow for using the Guides and Surveys API for localization follows these steps:

1. Export content using the GET endpoint to retrieve XLIFF 1.2 files
2. Process translations in an external translation management system
3. Import translated content using the POST endpoint with updated XLIFF files
4. System automatically updates and purges caches to reflect the new translations

## Product Ecosystem

The Guides and Surveys API appears to be part of a larger customer experience platform focused on user engagement and feedback collection. The emphasis on localization suggests that the product is designed for enterprises with global reach that need to deliver consistent, culturally appropriate experiences across different languages and regions.

The API-first approach indicates that it's designed to integrate with:
- Content management systems
- Translation management platforms
- Customer experience suites
- Enterprise feedback systems

This positions the Guides and Surveys API as a component in a broader digital experience ecosystem, allowing organizations to automate translation workflows and incorporate multilingual content into their customer engagement strategies.
