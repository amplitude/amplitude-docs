# Guides and Surveys API

## Overview

The Guides and Surveys API is a set of endpoints that allows for programmatic management of guides, surveys, and their translations. The API is particularly focused on localization capabilities, enabling users to import and export translation files for guides and surveys in a standardized format.

## Key Features

- **Localization Support**: Import and export translations in XLIFF 1.2 format
- **Integration with Translation Management Systems**: Seamless workflow with external translation tools
- **Multi-guide/Multi-survey Support**: Process translations for multiple guides or surveys in a single request
- **Multiple Locale Support**: Handle translations for multiple target languages

## Localization API (Beta)

The Localization API is a core component that enables programmatic management of translations for guides and surveys.

### Key Concepts

- **XLIFF 1.2 Format**: The standard format used for translation files, which includes source text and translated content
- **Source Language**: The original language of the content (specified as `source-language` in XLIFF)
- **Target Language**: The language into which content is being translated (specified as `target-language` in XLIFF)
- **Trans-unit Elements**: Individual translation units within the XLIFF file that contain source and target text
- **Variants**: Support for different versions of text within the same translation unit

### API Endpoints

#### Export Translations
- **Method**: GET
- **Authentication**: Basic Authentication
- **Functionality**: Retrieves translation files for specified guides/surveys and locales

#### Import Translations
- **Method**: POST
- **Authentication**: Basic Authentication
- **Functionality**: Uploads translated content for guides/surveys

### File Structure

The XLIFF files used with the API follow a specific structure:
- XML declaration
- XLIFF root element with version attribute
- File element with source-language and target-language attributes
- Body element containing trans-unit elements
- Trans-unit elements with id, source, and target content

### Integration Workflow

1. Export translations from the platform using the GET endpoint
2. Process translations in an external translation management system
3. Import completed translations back using the POST endpoint
4. System automatically purges caches to reflect updated translations

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Guides and Surveys API appears to be part of a larger product ecosystem focused on customer engagement and experience management. The localization capabilities suggest that the product is designed for global businesses that need to provide localized content to their customers across different regions and languages.

## Technical Considerations

- Cache purging occurs automatically after translation imports
- The API is currently in Beta status
- Authentication is handled via Basic Authentication
- The API supports the standard XLIFF 1.2 format for maximum compatibility with translation tools
