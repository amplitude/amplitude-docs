# Guides and Surveys API

## Overview

The Guides and Surveys API is a platform that enables programmatic management of guides and surveys, with a specific focus on localization capabilities. The API allows users to create, manage, and translate content across multiple languages, making it suitable for organizations with global reach that need to deliver localized user experiences.

## Key Features

- **Localization Support**: Programmatic import and export of translation files in XLIFF 1.2 format
- **Translation Management**: Integration with external translation management systems
- **Multi-locale Support**: Ability to handle multiple guides/surveys and locales simultaneously
- **Authentication**: Secure access through Basic Authentication
- **Variant Support**: Handling of content variations across different locales

## Localization API (Beta)

The Localization API is a core component that facilitates the translation workflow for guides and surveys content.

### Key Endpoints

1. **Import Translations**
   - Method: POST
   - Authentication: Basic Authentication
   - Format: XLIFF 1.2
   - Purpose: Import translated content back into the system

2. **Export Translations**
   - Method: GET
   - Authentication: Basic Authentication
   - Format: XLIFF 1.2
   - Purpose: Extract content for translation

### File Structure and Format

The API uses XLIFF 1.2 as the standard format for translation exchange. Key aspects include:

- **trans-unit elements**: Contain the translatable content
- **source-language**: Specifies the original language of the content
- **target-language**: Specifies the language being translated to
- **Variant support**: Allows for content variations specific to different locales

### Integration Workflow

1. Export content using the GET endpoint
2. Process translations in an external translation management system
3. Import translated content using the POST endpoint
4. System automatically purges caches to reflect updated translations

## Product Ecosystem

The Guides and Surveys API appears to be part of a larger product ecosystem focused on customer engagement and experience management. The localization capabilities suggest that the product is designed for global enterprises that need to deliver consistent experiences across different languages and regions.

The API-first approach indicates that it's designed to integrate with other systems and platforms, allowing for automation of translation workflows and seamless incorporation into existing content management processes.

## Technical Considerations

- The API is currently in Beta status
- Authentication is handled through Basic Authentication
- Cache purging is automatic after translation imports
- The system supports the XLIFF 1.2 standard for translation interchange
- Multiple guides and surveys can be processed in a single request
