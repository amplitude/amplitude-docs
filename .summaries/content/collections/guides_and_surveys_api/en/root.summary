# Guides and Surveys API

## Overview

The Guides and Surveys API is a programmatic interface that enables the management of guides and surveys content, with a specific focus on localization capabilities. The API is designed to facilitate the translation and localization of content through integration with external translation management systems.

## Key Features

- **Localization Support**: Import and export translation files in XLIFF 1.2 format
- **External Integration**: Connect with third-party translation management systems
- **Authentication**: Secure access using App ID and App Secret Key via Basic Authentication
- **Multilingual Content Management**: Support for multiple languages and variants

## Localization API (Beta)

The Localization API component allows developers to programmatically manage translations for guides and surveys content.

### Key Endpoints

- **Import Translations**: `POST` request to import translated content
- **Export Translations**: `GET` request to export content for translation

### Authentication

The API uses Basic Authentication with:
- App ID (username)
- App Secret Key (password)

### File Format

The API works with XLIFF 1.2 format files, which include:
- `source-language`: Original language of the content
- `target-language`: Language the content is being translated to
- `trans-unit` elements: Individual translatable text units

### Language Variant Support

The API supports language variants (e.g., en-US, en-GB) for more precise localization targeting.

### Cache Management

After importing translations, the system automatically purges relevant caches to ensure updated content is immediately available.

## Integration in Product Ecosystem

The Guides and Surveys API appears to be part of a larger product ecosystem for customer engagement and content management. The localization capabilities suggest that the product is designed for global businesses needing to deliver content in multiple languages.

The API enables a workflow where content created in the main application can be exported, translated through external systems, and then reimported with the translations, maintaining the connection between original and translated content.

## Technical Requirements

- Support for XLIFF 1.2 format
- Ability to make authenticated HTTP requests
- Understanding of language codes and variants according to ISO standards
