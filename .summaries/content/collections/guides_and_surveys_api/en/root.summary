## Guides and Surveys Localization API

The Guides and Surveys Localization API is a Beta-stage REST API designed to facilitate programmatic translation management for LaunchDarkly's guides and surveys functionality. This API enables seamless integration with translation management systems (TMS) through standardized XLIFF 1.2 file format support.

## Core Features and Capabilities

The API provides comprehensive localization workflow support through:

- **XLIFF 1.2 Translation File Management**: Import and export capabilities for industry-standard translation files
- **Programmatic Translation Workflows**: Automated integration with external translation management systems
- **Multi-language Content Support**: Management of source and target language configurations
- **Feature Flag Integration**: Direct mapping between translations and LaunchDarkly feature flags through flag_key parameters

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Guides and Surveys Localization API operates as a specialized component within LaunchDarkly's broader feature flag ecosystem. It specifically handles the internationalization layer for user-facing guides and surveys that are controlled by feature flags. The API creates a bridge between LaunchDarkly's feature flag variants and external translation workflows, enabling organizations to manage multilingual user experiences programmatically.

The relationship structure follows this hierarchy:
- **Feature Flags** (identified by flag_key) contain multiple variants
- **Variants** represent different versions or configurations of guides/surveys
- **Trans-units** within XLIFF files map to specific translatable elements
- **Target/Source Languages** define the translation direction and locale support

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Flag Key**: Unique identifier for LaunchDarkly feature flags that control guide and survey display
**Variant Identifier**: Specific version or configuration of a guide/survey within a feature flag
**Trans-unit Elements**: Individual translatable segments within XLIFF files, containing source and target text
**XLIFF 1.2**: XML Localization Interchange File Format standard for translation file exchange
**Nudge Translations**: Specific type of user interface prompts or guidance messages requiring localization
**Original Attribute Mapping**: System for maintaining relationships between source content and translated versions
**Cache Purging**: Process of clearing stored translation data to ensure updated content delivery
**Target-language/Source-language Codes**: ISO language codes defining translation pairs

## Ecosystem Integration

Within LaunchDarkly's product ecosystem, this API serves as the localization bridge for user-facing content controlled by feature flags. It enables organizations to:

- Maintain consistent multilingual experiences across feature flag variations
- Integrate LaunchDarkly's experimentation capabilities with enterprise translation workflows
- Scale international product releases through automated translation management
- Ensure translation consistency across different user segments and experiments

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

The API operates under the base path `guides-surveys/api/v1/localization` and implements:

**Authentication**: Basic Authentication using App ID and App Secret Key credentials
**File Format**: Strict XLIFF 1.2 compliance for translation file structure
**Integration Pattern**: RESTful endpoints designed for TMS system integration
**Caching Strategy**: Built-in cache management for translation delivery optimization

The API's Beta status indicates active development with potential breaking changes, positioning it as an evolving solution for organizations requiring sophisticated multilingual feature flag management capabilities.
