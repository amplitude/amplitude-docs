# Guides and Surveys API

## Overview

The Guides and Surveys API is a programmatic interface that enables the management of guides and surveys, with a specific focus on localization capabilities. Currently in Beta, the API allows users to import and export translation files in XLIFF 1.2 format, facilitating integration with external translation management systems.

## Key Features

- **Localization Support**: Import and export translations for guides and surveys in XLIFF 1.2 format
- **Multi-locale Support**: Handle translations for multiple locales simultaneously
- **External Integration**: Connect with third-party translation management systems
- **Authentication**: Secure access through Basic Authentication
- **Cache Management**: Automatic cache purging upon successful translation imports

## Key Concepts and Nomenclature

- **XLIFF 1.2**: XML Localization Interchange File Format, the standard format used for translation exchange
- **Source Language**: The original language of the content being translated
- **Target Language**: The language into which content is being translated
- **trans-unit elements**: Individual translation units within the XLIFF file that contain source and target text
- **Variant support**: Capability to handle different variations of content for specific contexts or audiences

## API Endpoints

### Import Translations
- **Endpoint**: POST request (specific URL not provided in documentation)
- **Authentication**: Basic Authentication
- **Payload**: XLIFF 1.2 format translation files
- **Functionality**: Imports translations for specified guides/surveys and locales

### Export Translations
- **Endpoint**: GET request (specific URL not provided in documentation)
- **Authentication**: Basic Authentication
- **Parameters**: Support for multiple guides/surveys and locales
- **Response**: XLIFF 1.2 format translation files

## Integration with Product Ecosystem

The Guides and Surveys API appears to be part of a larger product ecosystem that includes content management for guides and surveys. The localization API specifically addresses the multilingual aspects of this content, allowing organizations to efficiently manage translations across multiple languages and regions.

The API is designed to work with existing translation workflows and management systems, serving as a bridge between the product's content and external translation services or tools.

## Technical Implementation Notes

- Successful translation imports trigger automatic cache purging to ensure updated content is immediately available
- The API supports structured translation file formats with specific requirements for source and target language identification
- Translation units must be properly formatted within the XLIFF structure for successful processing
