## Guides and Surveys Localization API

The Guides and Surveys Localization API is a beta REST API service designed to facilitate programmatic translation management for guides and surveys content. The API enables seamless integration with translation management systems through standardized XLIFF 1.2 file format support for importing and exporting translatable content.

## Core Features and Capabilities

The API provides comprehensive localization workflow support through:

- **XLIFF 1.2 Translation File Management**: Full support for industry-standard XLIFF 1.2 format for translation import/export operations
- **Programmatic Translation Workflows**: Automated integration capabilities with external translation management systems
- **Multi-language Content Support**: Handles source and target language mapping with proper language code identification
- **Content Variant Management**: Supports multiple content variants through flag_key and variant identifier mapping
- **Authentication Security**: Implements App ID and App Secret Key authentication using Basic Authentication protocol

## Product Architecture and Relationships

The Guides and Surveys Localization API operates as a specialized component within a broader content management ecosystem. The API serves as a bridge between internal guides/surveys content and external translation management systems, enabling:

- **Content Extraction**: Retrieval of translatable content elements from guides and surveys
- **Translation Integration**: Seamless workflow integration with third-party translation services
- **Content Synchronization**: Bidirectional content flow between internal systems and translation platforms
- **Cache Management**: Automatic cache purging mechanisms to ensure content freshness

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**flag_key**: Primary identifier parameter that maps to specific guide or survey content instances, serving as the core reference for content retrieval and management.

**variant**: Secondary identifier that specifies particular versions or variations of content associated with a flag_key, enabling granular content management.

**trans-unit elements**: XLIFF-standard translation units that contain the actual translatable content segments, structured with source and target language mappings.

**nudge translations**: Specific type of translatable content related to user interface prompts and guidance messages within the guides and surveys system.

**original attribute mapping**: XLIFF metadata that maintains traceability between translated content and its source material through structured attribute relationships.

**target-language codes**: ISO-standard language identifiers that specify the destination language for translation operations.

**source-language codes**: ISO-standard language identifiers that specify the original language of content being translated.

## API Endpoints and Integration

The API operates through the base endpoint structure:
- **Base Path**: `guides-surveys/api/v1/localization`

**Authentication Method**: Basic Authentication using App ID and App Secret Key credentials for secure API access.

**Primary Operations**:
- Translation file export for extracting translatable content
- Translation file import for updating content with completed translations
- Cache purging operations for content synchronization

## Ecosystem Integration

The Guides and Surveys Localization API functions as a critical component in a larger content delivery and management ecosystem. It enables organizations to:

- Integrate guides and surveys content into existing translation workflows
- Maintain consistency across multi-language content deployments
- Automate translation processes through programmatic interfaces
- Ensure content synchronization between development and localization teams

The beta status indicates active development with potential for feature expansion and API refinement based on user feedback and integration requirements.
