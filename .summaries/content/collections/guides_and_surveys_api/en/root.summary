# Guides and Surveys API

## Overview

The Guides and Surveys API is a set of endpoints that allows for programmatic management of guides, surveys, and their translations. The API is particularly focused on localization capabilities, enabling users to import and export translation files for guides and surveys in a standardized format.

## Key Features

- **Localization Support**: Import and export translations in XLIFF 1.2 format
- **Integration with Translation Management Systems**: Seamless workflow with external translation tools
- **Multi-guide/Multi-survey Support**: Process translations for multiple guides or surveys in a single request
- **Multiple Locale Support**: Handle translations for multiple target languages

## Localization API (Beta)

The Localization API is a core component that enables programmatic management of translations for guides and surveys.

### Key Concepts

- **XLIFF 1.2 Format**: The standard format used for translation files, which includes source text and translated content
- **Source Language**: The original language of the content (specified in the XLIFF file)
- **Target Language**: The language into which content is being translated (specified in the XLIFF file)
- **Trans-unit Elements**: Individual translation units within the XLIFF file that contain source and target text
- **Variants**: Support for different versions of the same text based on context

### API Endpoints

#### Import Translations
- **Endpoint**: POST request (specific URL not provided in documentation)
- **Authentication**: Basic Authentication
- **Functionality**: Imports translations from XLIFF 1.2 files
- **Request Body**: XLIFF 1.2 formatted file

#### Export Translations
- **Endpoint**: GET request (specific URL not provided in documentation)
- **Authentication**: Basic Authentication
- **Functionality**: Exports translations to XLIFF 1.2 files
- **Parameters**: Support for multiple guides/surveys and locales

### File Structure Requirements

The XLIFF files used with the API must follow specific structural requirements:
- Must be valid XLIFF 1.2 format
- Must include proper source-language and target-language attributes
- Trans-unit elements must contain both source and target text
- Support for variant attributes to handle context-specific translations

### Integration Considerations

- **Cache Purging**: After importing translations, cache purging may be necessary for changes to take effect
- **Authentication**: All API requests require Basic Authentication
- **Error Handling**: The API provides error responses for invalid requests or file formats

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Guides and Surveys API appears to be part of a larger product ecosystem focused on customer engagement and experience management. The localization capabilities suggest that the product is designed for global businesses that need to provide localized content to their customers across different regions and languages.

The API's focus on programmatic translation management indicates it's designed to integrate with enterprise-level workflows where content may be managed across multiple systems and requires efficient localization processes.
