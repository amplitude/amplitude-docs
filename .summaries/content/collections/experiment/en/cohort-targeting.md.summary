## Summary
This documentation covers cohort targeting in Amplitude Experiment, explaining how static and dynamic user cohorts work with remote evaluation (hourly sync to Amplitude Experiment destination) versus local evaluation (hourly sync to Experiment Local Evaluation destination, requires user IDs, server-side SDK support only), including SDK configuration with cohortSyncConfig and API/secret keys.
