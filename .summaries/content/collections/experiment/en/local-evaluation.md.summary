**Summary:** This documentation covers local evaluation in Amplitude Experiment, which runs evaluation logic in the SDK rather than making network requests, providing sub-millisecond performance but with limited targeting capabilities compared to remote evaluation (no Amplitude ID resolution, user enrichment, or sticky bucketing).

**Keywords:**
- local evaluation
- SDK evaluation logic
- sub-millisecond evaluation

- individual inclusions
- cohort targeting server-side
- assignment events vs exposure events

- edge evaluation Node.js
- Amplitude ID resolution limitations
- user enrichment limitations
- sticky bucketing limitations
