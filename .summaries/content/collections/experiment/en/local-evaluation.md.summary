# Summary
Local evaluation in Amplitude Experiment runs evaluation logic directly in the SDK without network requests, providing sub-millisecond performance for latency-sensitive systems. It supports consistent bucketing and targeting segments but lacks Amplitude ID resolution, user enrichment, and sticky bucketing available in remote evaluation, with server-side SDKs offering cohort targeting for User IDs in specific versions.
