**Summary:** This documentation covers local evaluation for Amplitude Experiment, which runs evaluation logic in SDKs rather than making network requests, achieving sub-millisecond performance but with limited targeting capabilities compared to remote evaluation (no Amplitude ID resolution, user enrichment, or sticky bucketing).

**Keywords:**
- local evaluation
- SDK evaluation logic

- exposure events client-side
- assignment events server-side
- flag configuration polling
- Amplitude ID resolution limitations
- user enrichment restrictions
- sticky bucketing unavailable
- edge evaluation Node.js
- client-side data leakage warning
