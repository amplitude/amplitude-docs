**Summary:** Documents local evaluation for Amplitude Experiment feature flags, which runs evaluation logic in SDKs rather than making network requests, achieving sub-millisecond performance but with limited targeting capabilities compared to remote evaluation (no Amplitude ID resolution, user enrichment, or sticky bucketing).
