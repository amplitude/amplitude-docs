**Summary:** This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of Amplitude Experiment's workflow-driven behavioral experimentation platform, covering the complete processes for creating A/B tests with hypothesis formation, metric selection, variant creation, and statistical analysis using sequential testing or T-test models, as well as feature flag creation for progressive feature delivery without metrics tracking.
