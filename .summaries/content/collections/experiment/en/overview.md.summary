## Summary
Amplitude Experiment is a behavioral experimentation platform that enables product teams to modify experiences through A/B testing, progressive feature delivery, and dynamic in-product experiences using flags. The documentation outlines two main workflows: creating experiments (which require hypotheses, metrics, variants, and statistical analysis) and implementing feature flags (which focus on controlled feature rollouts without metrics).
