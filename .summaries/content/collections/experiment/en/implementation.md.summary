## Summary
This documentation covers Amplitude Experiment's evaluation implementation, detailing the complete process of determining user variant bucketing through pre-targeting steps (activation, flag dependencies, individual inclusions, sticky bucketing), targeting segments, and consistent bucketing using murmur3 hashing with bucketing salt and allocation percentages.
