## Summary
This documentation covers Amplitude Experiment's evaluation implementation, detailing the process of determining user variant bucketing through pre-targeting steps (activation, flag dependencies, individual inclusions, sticky bucketing) and targeting segments, using consistent bucketing with murmur3 hashing algorithm and bucketing salts.
