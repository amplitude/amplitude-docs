# Summary
This documentation explains Amplitude Experiment's evaluation process, detailing how users are assigned to variants based on pre-targeting steps (activation, flag dependencies, inclusions, sticky bucketing), targeting segments, and consistent bucketing algorithms that use murmur3 hashing to determine allocation and variant assignment.
