# Summary
This documentation page explains the implementation of Amplitude Experiment's evaluation process, detailing how users are assigned to variants based on pre-targeting steps (activation, flag dependencies, inclusions, sticky bucketing), targeting segments, and consistent bucketing algorithms using murmur3 hashing for both allocation and variant assignment.
