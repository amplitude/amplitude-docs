**Summary:** This documentation covers Amplitude Experiment's evaluation implementation, detailing the bucketing algorithm that determines user variant assignment using murmur3 hashing, pre-targeting steps (activation, flag dependencies, inclusions, sticky bucketing), targeting segments, and consistent bucketing with allocation/variant distribution logic.
