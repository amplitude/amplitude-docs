## Amplitude Experiment

Amplitude Experiment is a feature flagging and experimentation platform that enables teams to safely deploy, test, and manage feature releases through controlled rollouts and A/B testing. The platform provides sophisticated access control mechanisms to ensure proper governance and security across different organizational roles and project structures.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

Amplitude Experiment operates as a standalone experimentation platform with its own independent permission system, separate from Amplitude Analytics. The core architecture centers around:

**Project-Level Organization**: Experiments and feature flags are organized within projects, each maintaining independent permission structures and access controls.

**Flag Management System**: Feature flags serve as the primary mechanism for controlling feature visibility and experimentation, with Enterprise customers receiving additional flag-level access restrictions for granular control.

**Role-Based Access Control**: A hierarchical permission system with four distinct roles (Viewer, Member, Manager, Admin) that determine user capabilities across flag creation, editing, deployment, and project management functions.

**API Integration Layer**: The Management API provides programmatic access that can bypass standard UI permissions, enabling automated workflows and integrations while maintaining audit trails.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Project-Level Permissions**: Access control system specific to Experiment projects, operating independently from Analytics permissions, governing user actions within individual experiment projects.

**Flag-Level Access Controls**: Enterprise feature allowing restriction of specific flags to designated editors, providing granular security for sensitive feature releases.

**Role Hierarchy**:
- **Viewer**: Read-only access to flags and experiments
- **Member**: Can create and edit flags, manage deployments
- **Manager**: Member permissions plus user management and project settings
- **Admin**: Full project control including deletion and advanced configurations

**Restricted Flags**: Enterprise-only feature flags with limited editor access, overriding standard role permissions for enhanced security.

**Mutual Exclusion Groups**: Feature groupings that prevent conflicting experiments from running simultaneously, with specific permission requirements for management.

**Management API Bypass**: Programmatic interface capability that circumvents UI-based permission restrictions while maintaining proper authentication and project-level access controls.

## Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Experiment integrates into the broader Amplitude ecosystem while maintaining operational independence. The platform connects with:

**Amplitude Analytics**: Separate permission systems allow different access patterns between experimentation and analytics workflows, enabling specialized team structures.

**Organization-Wide Defaults**: Project permissions inherit from organization-level settings, providing consistent baseline access while allowing project-specific customization.

**Enterprise Security Framework**: Advanced customers receive enhanced security features including flag-level restrictions and detailed audit capabilities.

**API Ecosystem**: Management API endpoints enable integration with CI/CD pipelines, automated deployment systems, and custom tooling while respecting permission boundaries.

## Technical Implementation

The permission system enforces access controls across multiple operational areas:

**Deployment Management**: Role-based restrictions on flag deployment capabilities, ensuring only authorized users can push changes to production environments.

**Project API Key Access**: Permission-controlled access to project-specific API keys, maintaining security boundaries for programmatic interactions.

**Cross-Project Isolation**: Independent permission structures prevent unauthorized access across project boundaries, supporting multi-team organizational structures.

The Management API provides programmatic alternatives to UI-based workflows, enabling automation while maintaining security through project-level authentication and access validation.
