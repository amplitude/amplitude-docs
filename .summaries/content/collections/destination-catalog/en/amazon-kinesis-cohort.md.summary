# Summary
Amazon Kinesis Cohort integration enables streaming cohort membership updates from Amplitude Data to AWS Kinesis streams in JSON format, supporting daily, hourly, and real-time sync cadences. The setup requires creating a Kinesis stream, configuring IAM roles with specific permissions for Amplitude, and establishing the connection in Amplitude's Destination Catalog.
