# Summary
Amazon Kinesis Cohort integration enables streaming cohort membership updates from Amplitude Data to AWS Kinesis streams in JSON format, supporting daily, hourly, and real-time sync cadences for paid Amplitude plans. The integration requires creating a Kinesis stream and configuring IAM roles with specific permissions to allow Amplitude to write to the stream.
