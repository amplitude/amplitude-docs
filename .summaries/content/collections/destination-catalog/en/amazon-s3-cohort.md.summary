# Summary
This documentation details the Amazon S3 (Cohort) destination integration that allows exporting Amplitude cohorts to S3 buckets, enabling synchronization with other databases and use in internal analytics. The integration uses IAM role-based access for security and exports cohorts as CSV files containing users who entered, exited, or existed in the cohort at sync time.
