## Summary
Zeda.io is a product discovery and strategy platform that integrates with Amplitude to sync cohorts, allowing product teams to identify customer problems, prioritize initiatives, and analyze cohort-specific feedback for informed decision-making. The integration requires a paid Amplitude plan, an active Zeda.io workspace, and involves copying an API key from Zeda.io to establish the connection.
