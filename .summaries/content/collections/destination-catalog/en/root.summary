## Amplitude Destination Catalog

Amplitude's destination catalog represents a comprehensive ecosystem of integrations that enable businesses to activate their behavioral analytics data across marketing, customer engagement, experimentation, and data infrastructure platforms. The catalog encompasses over 100 destination integrations spanning multiple categories including event streaming, cohort syncing, data warehousing, and specialized use cases.

## Core Integration Types and Architecture

The destination catalog operates through four primary integration patterns:

**Event Streaming Destinations** forward real-time event data and user properties from Amplitude to external platforms using APIs. These integrations typically require authentication tokens, support event filtering, and maintain user identifier mapping between platforms. Examples include Customer.io, Braze, HubSpot, and Google Analytics 4.

**Cohort Sync Destinations** export Amplitude's behavioral cohorts to marketing and engagement platforms for audience targeting. These integrations sync user segments based on behavioral criteria, supporting scheduled, one-time, and real-time sync cadences. Key examples include Facebook Ads, Google Ads, Mailchimp, and Salesforce Marketing Cloud.

**Data Warehouse Destinations** enable bulk export of raw events and merged user data to cloud storage and analytics platforms. These include Amazon S3, Google BigQuery, Snowflake, and Azure Blob Storage, supporting recurring syncs, historical backfills, and specific schema formats.

**Specialized Destinations** serve niche use cases like experimentation (Split, Optimizely, LaunchDarkly), customer success (Planhat), feedback analysis (Enterpret, unitQ), and attribution (AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch).

## Key Technical Components and Nomenclature

**Authentication Methods** vary by platform but commonly include API keys, OAuth tokens, service account credentials, and webhook configurations. Many integrations require specific permission scopes and role-based access controls.

**User Identifier Mapping** represents a critical component where Amplitude's user_id, amplitude_id, or User Properties must map to destination platform identifiers like email addresses, external IDs, device identifiers (IDFA, GAID), or platform-specific user IDs.

**Sync Cadences** define data transmission frequency, ranging from real-time streaming to scheduled intervals (hourly, daily). Cohort destinations typically support multiple cadence options while event streaming maintains near real-time transmission.

**Event Filtering and Property Selection** allow selective data transmission through configurable filters, property mappings, and transformation rules. Many destinations support Apache FreeMarker templating for payload customization.

**Data Schemas and Formats** follow standardized structures, particularly for warehouse destinations using JSON formats with fields like amplitude_id, event_properties, user_properties, server_upload_time, and client_event_time.

## Platform Ecosystem Integration

The destination catalog integrates with Amplitude's broader product ecosystem through several key touchpoints:

**Amplitude Data** serves as the central hub for destination configuration, providing the Data Catalog interface for setup, authentication, and sync management across all destination types.

**Amplitude Activation** specifically handles real-time event streaming and cohort syncing for marketing automation and customer engagement use cases, supporting bidirectional data flows and advanced audience targeting.

**Behavioral Cohorts** represent a core data product that powers many destination integrations, enabling sophisticated audience segmentation based on user actions, properties, and engagement patterns.

**User Profile API** enables destinations like Movable Ink to access comprehensive user data including computed properties, cohort memberships, and recommendations for personalized content generation.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

Common API patterns include:

**Cohort Sync APIs** typically use REST endpoints with JSON payloads containing cohort_name, cohort_id, in_cohort boolean flags, computed_time timestamps, message_id for deduplication, and users arrays with user_properties.

**Event Streaming APIs** forward events using platform-specific formats, often requiring property mapping between Amplitude's event schema and destination requirements. Rate limiting, retry mechanisms, and error handling are standardized across integrations.

**Webhook Destinations** support custom endpoint configuration with configurable headers, Apache FreeMarker templating for payload transformation, and retry policies with exponential backoff over 4-hour windows.

**Cloud Storage Integrations** use service account authentication with specific IAM permissions (e.g., storage.objects.create for GCS, s3:PutObject for S3) and support partitioned file structures based on server_upload_time.

The destination catalog represents Amplitude's commitment to data activation, enabling businesses to leverage behavioral analytics across their entire technology stack while maintaining data consistency, security, and operational efficiency through standardized integration patterns and comprehensive platform support.
