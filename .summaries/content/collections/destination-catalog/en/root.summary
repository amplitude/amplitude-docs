## Amplitude Destination Catalog

Amplitude provides a comprehensive destination catalog that enables organizations to sync behavioral analytics data and user segments to external platforms for enhanced customer engagement and data warehousing. The destination catalog supports bidirectional data flows, allowing both raw event exports and cohort synchronization to power downstream marketing, messaging, and analytics workflows.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The destination catalog operates as a bridge between Amplitude's core analytics platform and external systems, supporting two primary integration patterns:

**Data Warehouse Destinations** facilitate large-scale data exports for analytics and business intelligence use cases. These integrations handle raw event data, merged user profiles, and historical datasets through recurring sync mechanisms.

**Marketing and Engagement Destinations** enable cohort-based targeting by synchronizing behavioral segments from Amplitude to customer engagement platforms. These integrations focus on real-time or near-real-time audience activation for personalized messaging campaigns.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Cohort Syncing**: The process of transferring user segments defined in Amplitude to external platforms for targeted messaging and engagement campaigns.

**Raw Events Export**: Bulk transfer of unprocessed event data from Amplitude to data warehouses, maintaining full event fidelity including metadata, user properties, and event properties.

**Merged User IDs**: Consolidated user identity mapping that resolves multiple user identifiers (amplitude_id, user_id, device_id) into unified user profiles for downstream analysis.

**Recurring Syncs**: Automated, scheduled data transfers that maintain up-to-date information flow between Amplitude and destination systems without manual intervention.

**Micro-batch Files**: Optimized data packaging format used for efficient transfer of event data to warehouse destinations, balancing transfer speed with computational costs.

**UAChannelID**: Airship-specific user identifier that maps Amplitude user profiles to Airship's messaging channels for targeted communication delivery.

**Tag Group Synchronization**: The mechanism by which Amplitude cohorts are represented as tag groups in destination platforms, enabling audience-based campaign targeting.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The destination catalog integrates with Amplitude's core analytics platform through **Amplitude Activation**, which serves as the orchestration layer for audience and data syndication. This connection enables organizations to operationalize behavioral insights by activating user segments across their marketing technology stack.

Authentication and security are standardized across destinations, with support for modern authentication methods including JWT token validation and key pair authentication, while legacy password-based authentication is being deprecated in favor of more secure alternatives.

## Technical Implementation Details

**Snowflake Integration**:
- API endpoint pattern: `ORGNAME-ACCOUNTNAME.snowflakecomputing.com`
- Authentication: Key pair authentication (recommended) or password authentication (deprecated)
- Required IP allowlisting for Amplitude's export infrastructure
- Event table schema includes standardized columns: `amplitude_id`, `uuid`, `client_event_time`, `server_received_time`
- VARIANT data types for flexible event and user property storage
- Auto-suspend configuration recommendations to optimize Snowflake computation costs

**Airship Integration**:
- Utilizes Airship API keys for authentication
- Channel ID mapping through Auto Channel ID functionality
- Integration with Airship's Message Composer for campaign targeting
- Tag group creation and management for cohort representation

The destination catalog supports both historical data exports for initial setup and ongoing incremental syncs to maintain data freshness across integrated systems.
