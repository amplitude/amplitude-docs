## Amplitude Destination Catalog

Amplitude's destination catalog represents a comprehensive ecosystem of data integration endpoints that enable organizations to activate their behavioral analytics data across marketing, customer engagement, experimentation, and business intelligence platforms. The catalog encompasses over 100 destination integrations spanning multiple categories and integration patterns.

### Core Integration Architecture

The destination catalog operates through three primary integration patterns:

**Event Streaming Destinations** forward real-time user events and properties from Amplitude to external platforms using APIs like HTTP V2 and Identify API. These integrations typically require authentication tokens, support event filtering, and maintain user property synchronization with configurable delivery mechanisms.

**Cohort Sync Destinations** export behavioral audience segments from Amplitude to marketing and engagement platforms. These integrations enable targeting specific user groups based on behavioral patterns, supporting various sync cadences (real-time, hourly, daily, scheduled) and user identifier mapping strategies.

**Raw Data Export Destinations** provide comprehensive data warehouse and cloud storage integrations for analytics and business intelligence use cases, supporting recurring exports, historical backfills, and structured data schemas.

### Key Integration Categories

**Marketing Automation & Customer Engagement** platforms including Braze, Customer.io, Klaviyo, Mailchimp, HubSpot, and Salesforce Marketing Cloud enable behavioral trigger campaigns, personalized messaging, and lifecycle marketing workflows through both event streaming and cohort synchronization.

**Advertising & Attribution Networks** such as Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads, LinkedIn Ads, and AppsFlyer support audience targeting, conversion tracking, and attribution measurement through cohort exports and event forwarding with specific identifier requirements (IDFA, GAID, email hashing).

**Experimentation & Feature Management** platforms including Optimizely, LaunchDarkly, Split, and Statsig leverage Amplitude cohorts for experiment targeting and feature flag segmentation, enabling behavior-driven experimentation workflows.

**Data Warehouses & Cloud Storage** destinations like Snowflake, Google BigQuery, Amazon S3, and Azure Blob Storage provide comprehensive data export capabilities with structured schemas, partitioning strategies, and deduplication mechanisms for analytics and business intelligence.

**Customer Success & Product Analytics** integrations with platforms like Planhat, Productboard, and various in-app messaging tools enable product-led growth strategies and customer health monitoring.

### Authentication & Configuration Patterns

Destinations employ various authentication mechanisms including API keys, OAuth flows, service account credentials, and bearer tokens. Common configuration requirements include:

- **User Identifier Mapping** between Amplitude user_id/properties and destination platform identifiers
- **Event Filtering** for selective data forwarding based on event types and properties  
- **Sync Cadence Configuration** for cohort destinations (real-time, scheduled, one-time)
- **Field Mapping** for user properties, event properties, and custom attributes
- **Rate Limiting & Error Handling** with retry mechanisms and delivery metrics

### Data Schemas & Payload Structures

Event streaming destinations typically receive Amplitude's Export API JSON format containing fields like amplitude_id, user_id, event_type, event_properties, user_properties, and timestamp information. Cohort destinations receive user lists with cohort membership indicators, while warehouse destinations support comprehensive schemas with VARIANT/SUPER data types for JSON fields.

### Enterprise & Compliance Features

The destination catalog includes enterprise-grade features such as IP allowlisting, VPC security group configuration, encryption support (KMS), service account-based authentication, and compliance with data residency requirements across different cloud regions and data centers.

### API Endpoints & Technical Implementation

Key technical endpoints include:
- Amplitude Export API for event data formatting
- Behavioral Cohorts API for audience segmentation
- User Profile API for real-time user data access
- Various destination-specific APIs (Braze HTTP V2, Google Ads Upload Click Conversions, Facebook Custom Audiences, etc.)

The destination catalog represents Amplitude's comprehensive approach to data activation, enabling organizations to leverage behavioral analytics insights across their entire technology stack through standardized integration patterns, robust authentication mechanisms, and flexible configuration options.
