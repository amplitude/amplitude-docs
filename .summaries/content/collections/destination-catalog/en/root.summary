## Amplitude Destination Catalog

Amplitude's destination catalog represents a comprehensive ecosystem of integrations that enable businesses to activate their behavioral analytics data across marketing, product, and customer engagement platforms. The catalog encompasses over 100 destinations spanning event streaming, cohort synchronization, and data warehouse exports.

### Core Integration Categories

**Event Streaming Destinations** form the backbone of real-time data activation, forwarding Amplitude events and user properties to platforms like Braze, Customer.io, Intercom, and HubSpot. These integrations typically require API key authentication and support configurable event filtering, user property mapping, and rate limiting (commonly 2MB request limits with 429 response handling).

**Cohort Synchronization** enables behavioral audience targeting across advertising networks (Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads, LinkedIn Ads), marketing automation platforms (Mailchimp, Klaviyo, SendGrid), and customer engagement tools (OneSignal, Pushwoosh, Airship). Cohort destinations support various sync cadences (real-time, hourly, daily, scheduled) and user identifier matching including email, device IDs (IDFA, AAID), and custom user IDs.

**Data Warehouse Destinations** provide enterprise-grade data export capabilities to Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, Snowflake, and cloud storage platforms (Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage). These integrations feature recurring syncs, historical backfills, IP allowlisting, and structured schemas for raw events and merged user tables.

### Key Technical Architecture

**Authentication Methods** vary by destination type: OAuth for social platforms (Facebook, Google, LinkedIn), API keys for most SaaS integrations, service account credentials for cloud platforms, and bearer tokens for enterprise solutions. Many integrations require specific IAM roles and permissions (e.g., Amplitude account ID 358203115967 for AWS integrations).

**Data Mapping and Transformation** centers around user identifier matching between Amplitude's user_id/amplitude_id and destination-specific identifiers. Common mappings include email addresses, external IDs, device identifiers, and custom user properties. SHA256 hashing is required for advertising platforms to ensure PII compliance.

**Payload Structures** follow standardized formats with Apache FreeMarker templating support for webhooks and custom destinations. Cohort payloads typically include cohort_id, cohort_name, in_cohort boolean flags, computed_time timestamps, and user arrays with properties.

### Platform Integration Patterns

**Marketing Automation Platforms** (Braze, Customer.io, HubSpot, Intercom) support bidirectional data flow with event forwarding, user property synchronization, and cohort targeting. These integrations enable triggered campaigns, behavioral segmentation, and personalized messaging workflows.

**Advertising Networks** (Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads, Snapchat Ads) focus on cohort synchronization for audience creation and retargeting campaigns. They require specific user identifier formats, minimum audience thresholds (typically 1000 users), and population delays (6-48 hours).

**Product Experience Platforms** (Appcues, CommandBar, Userflow, Chameleon) leverage cohort data for in-app personalization, onboarding flows, feature adoption campaigns, and contextual messaging based on user behavior patterns.

**Customer Success and Analytics** platforms (Planhat, Mixpanel, FullStory, Hotjar) receive event streams for customer health scoring, session analysis, and user experience optimization.

### Data Export and Warehouse Integration

**Cloud Storage Exports** support hourly partitioned JSON.gz files with server_upload_time partitioning and amplitude_id deduplication. File naming follows projectID_yyyy-MM-dd_H#partitionInteger.json.gz conventions with automatic compression and archiving.

**Database Schemas** include standardized Event and Merged User tables with SUPER/VARIANT data types for JSON properties, BIGNUMERIC amplitude_id fields, and timestamp columns for event_time, client_event_time, and server_received_time.

**Sync Mechanisms** offer manual backfills, recurring syncs with configurable frequencies, and real-time streaming with micro-batch processing for optimal performance and cost management.

### API Endpoints and Technical Specifications

Common API patterns include:
- **Cohort Sync APIs**: POST endpoints for user batch updates with cohort membership flags
- **Event Streaming APIs**: Real-time event forwarding with property transformation
- **User Profile APIs**: Identify calls for user attribute synchronization
- **Webhook Endpoints**: Custom payload delivery with retry mechanisms and exponential backoff

Rate limiting varies by destination but commonly includes per-minute user limits (1000 users/minute for Talon.One), daily API call limits (24 calls/day for TikTok Ads), and request size limits (2MB for most streaming destinations).

The destination catalog represents Amplitude's commitment to data activation across the entire customer journey, enabling businesses to leverage behavioral insights for personalized experiences, targeted marketing, and data-driven product decisions across their technology stack.
