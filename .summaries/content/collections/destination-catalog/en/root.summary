## Amplitude Destination Catalog

Amplitude's destination catalog represents a comprehensive ecosystem of over 100 integrations that enable businesses to activate their behavioral analytics data across marketing, product, and customer engagement platforms. The catalog serves as the central hub for connecting Amplitude's analytics insights to downstream tools and platforms for data-driven decision making and customer experience optimization.

### Core Integration Categories

The destination catalog encompasses several key integration types:

**Event Streaming Destinations** forward real-time user events and properties from Amplitude to external platforms, enabling immediate activation of behavioral data. These integrations typically use HTTP APIs and support selective event filtering, user property mapping, and real-time data transmission.

**Cohort Syncing Destinations** export user segments built in Amplitude to marketing automation, messaging, and experimentation platforms. Cohorts can be synchronized on various cadences (real-time, hourly, daily, or scheduled) and support different user identifier mappings (email, user_id, device IDs, etc.).

**Warehouse Destinations** enable bulk export of raw event data and merged user profiles to data warehouses like Snowflake, BigQuery, and Redshift for advanced analytics, reporting, and data science workflows.

**Raw Events Integrations** provide direct access to Amplitude's event stream for ETL processes, custom analytics pipelines, and data lake architectures.

### Key Platform Relationships

The destination catalog integrations fall into several functional categories:

**Marketing Automation & CRM**: Platforms like HubSpot, Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Braze, Iterable, and Customer.io receive Amplitude cohorts and events to power personalized campaigns, lead scoring, and customer journey orchestration.

**Ad Networks & Paid Media**: Integrations with Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads, LinkedIn Ads, and Snapchat enable audience targeting and conversion tracking using Amplitude's behavioral segments.

**Product Experience & Engagement**: Tools like Appcues, CommandBar, Userflow, and Chameleon use Amplitude cohorts to trigger in-app experiences, onboarding flows, and feature adoption campaigns.

**Customer Success & Support**: Platforms like Planhat, Intercom, and Zendesk leverage Amplitude data for proactive customer health monitoring and support ticket prioritization.

**Experimentation & Feature Management**: Integrations with Optimizely, LaunchDarkly, Split, and Statsig enable behavior-based experiment targeting and feature flag management.

### Technical Architecture & Authentication

Most destinations follow consistent patterns for setup and authentication:

**API Key Authentication** is the most common method, requiring platform-specific API keys, tokens, or credentials for secure data transmission.

**OAuth Authentication** is used for platforms like Google, Facebook, HubSpot, and Salesforce, providing secure, token-based access with proper permission scoping.

**Service Account Authentication** is employed for cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure, using IAM roles and service principals for secure data export.

**User Identifier Mapping** is critical across all integrations, with common mapping fields including:
- Email addresses (most universal)
- Platform-specific user IDs
- Device identifiers (IDFA, GAID, Android ID)
- Custom user properties
- Anonymous identifiers

### Data Formats & Schemas

Destinations support various data formats depending on the integration type:

**JSON Format** is standard for event streaming, using Amplitude's Export API schema with fields like `user_id`, `event_name`, `event_properties`, `user_properties`, and timestamps.

**CSV Format** is common for cohort exports, typically including user identifiers and optional user properties in tabular format.

**Warehouse Schemas** follow structured table formats with specific column types (VARCHAR, SUPER, VARIANT) for event tables and merged user tables.

### Rate Limiting & Performance

The catalog implements various performance controls:

**Rate Limiting** varies by destination, with common limits including:
- 2MB request size limits
- API call quotas (e.g., 24 calls/day for TikTok Ads)
- User throughput limits (e.g., 1000 users/minute for Talon.One)

**Retry Mechanisms** handle temporary failures with exponential backoff and jitter, typically attempting 9 retries over 4 hours for webhook destinations.

**Sync Cadences** range from real-time streaming to scheduled daily/weekly syncs, depending on the destination's capabilities and use case requirements.

### Common API Endpoints & Commands

Key technical implementations include:

**Cohort Sync APIs** typically use endpoints like:
- `POST /cohorts/{cohort_id}/users` for adding users
- `DELETE /cohorts/{cohort_id}/users` for removing users
- `GET /cohorts/{cohort_id}/status` for sync status

**Event Streaming APIs** commonly use:
- `POST /events` for real-time event forwarding
- `POST /identify` for user property updates
- `POST /batch` for bulk event transmission

**Warehouse Exports** utilize:
- Recurring sync jobs with configurable frequencies
- Manual backfill capabilities for historical data
- Incremental updates based on `server_upload_time` partitioning

### Integration Maintenance & Support

The catalog includes both **Amplitude-maintained** and **partner-maintained** integrations, with clear documentation of ownership and support channels. Partner-maintained integrations often require coordination with the destination platform's support team for troubleshooting and configuration assistance.

The destination catalog represents Amplitude's commitment to data activation and customer data platform capabilities, enabling businesses to leverage behavioral analytics insights across their entire technology stack for improved customer experiences and business outcomes.
