## Amplitude Destination Catalog

Amplitude's destination catalog represents a comprehensive ecosystem of data integration endpoints that enable organizations to activate their behavioral analytics data across marketing, customer engagement, experimentation, and data infrastructure platforms. The catalog encompasses over 100 destination integrations spanning cohort syncing, event streaming, and data warehouse exports.

## Core Integration Types and Architecture

The destination catalog operates through three primary integration patterns:

**Cohort Syncing Destinations** enable behavioral audience segmentation by exporting user cohorts from Amplitude to marketing automation platforms, customer engagement tools, and advertising networks. These integrations typically require user identifier mapping (email, user_id, device IDs) and support scheduled, one-time, or real-time sync cadences.

**Event Streaming Destinations** provide real-time forwarding of user events and properties from Amplitude to downstream platforms using APIs, webhooks, or SDK plugins. These integrations support selective event filtering, property mapping, and often include retry mechanisms with exponential backoff.

**Data Warehouse and Cloud Storage Destinations** facilitate bulk data exports to analytical data stores including Amazon S3, Google BigQuery, Snowflake, Azure Blob Storage, and Amazon Redshift. These integrations support recurring hourly syncs, historical backfills, and structured schemas for both raw events and merged user data.

## Authentication and Configuration Patterns

Destinations employ various authentication mechanisms including API keys, OAuth flows, service account credentials, and bearer tokens. Common configuration requirements include:

- **User Identifier Mapping**: Matching Amplitude user_id or User Properties to destination platform identifiers (email, external_id, device IDs)
- **API Credentials**: Platform-specific authentication tokens, keys, and endpoint configurations
- **Field Mapping**: Property transformations between Amplitude event/user schemas and destination requirements
- **Sync Cadences**: Configurable timing for data synchronization (real-time, hourly, daily, scheduled)

## Marketing and Customer Engagement Ecosystem

The catalog includes extensive integrations with marketing automation platforms (HubSpot, Marketo, Salesforce Marketing Cloud), customer engagement tools (Braze, Iterable, Customer.io), and messaging platforms (OneSignal, Pushwoosh, Airship). These destinations enable:

- Behavioral cohort targeting for personalized campaigns
- Real-time event triggering for automated workflows  
- Cross-channel messaging orchestration
- Customer lifecycle automation based on product usage

## Advertising and Attribution Networks

Ad network destinations (Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads, Snapchat Ads, TheTradeDesk) support audience creation and conversion tracking through:

- Device identifier matching (IDFA, GAID, AAID)
- SHA256 hashing for privacy compliance
- Custom audience creation from behavioral cohorts
- Conversion API integration for attribution measurement

## Experimentation and Feature Management

Experimentation platforms (Optimizely, LaunchDarkly, Split, Statsig) leverage Amplitude cohorts for:

- Targeted experiment audience creation
- Feature flag segmentation based on behavioral data
- A/B testing with pre-defined user segments
- Causal analysis integration for experiment measurement

## Data Infrastructure and Analytics

Cloud storage and warehouse destinations provide enterprise-grade data export capabilities:

- **Amazon S3/Google Cloud Storage**: JSON format exports with hourly partitioning
- **Snowflake/BigQuery/Redshift**: Structured table schemas with automatic deduplication
- **Streaming Platforms**: Kinesis, Pub/Sub for real-time data pipelines
- **ETL Connectors**: Fivetran integration for automated data pipeline management

## Key Technical Specifications

**API Endpoints**: Destinations utilize platform-specific APIs including REST endpoints, GraphQL interfaces, and proprietary SDKs for data transmission.

**Rate Limiting**: Most integrations implement rate limiting with typical constraints ranging from 10-1000 requests per minute, with retry mechanisms for 429 responses.

**Data Size Limits**: Event streaming destinations commonly enforce 2MB request limits, while some platforms have specific constraints (64 bytes for Lantern, 1MB for Kameleoon).

**Schema Requirements**: Destinations often require specific field mappings, data types, and naming conventions aligned with their platform schemas.

## Specialized Use Cases

**Customer Success Platforms** (Planhat, Gainsight) enable proactive customer health monitoring through behavioral event streaming.

**Product Analytics Enhancement** destinations (FullStory, Hotjar) combine quantitative Amplitude data with qualitative user session insights.

**Feedback and Research Platforms** (Qualtrics, Maze, Enterpret) merge behavioral cohorts with qualitative feedback for comprehensive user understanding.

**In-App Experience Platforms** (Appcues, CommandBar, Userflow) leverage behavioral data for personalized onboarding and feature adoption campaigns.

The destination catalog represents Amplitude's commitment to data activation across the modern marketing and product technology stack, enabling organizations to operationalize behavioral insights through their existing tool ecosystem while maintaining data governance and privacy compliance standards.
