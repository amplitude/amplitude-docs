## Amplitude Destination Catalog

Amplitude's destination catalog provides a comprehensive ecosystem of integrations that enable businesses to activate their behavioral analytics data across marketing, product, and customer engagement platforms. The catalog encompasses over 100 destinations spanning event streaming, cohort syncing, and data warehousing capabilities.

### Core Integration Types and Architecture

The destination catalog operates through three primary integration patterns:

**Event Streaming Destinations** forward real-time user events and properties from Amplitude to external platforms using APIs like HTTP V2 and Identify API. These integrations typically require authentication tokens, user ID mapping, and support event filtering with property transformations.

**Cohort Syncing Destinations** export Amplitude's behavioral cohorts to marketing and engagement platforms for audience targeting. These integrations use scheduled sync cadences (real-time, hourly, daily) and require user identifier mapping between platforms.

**Warehouse Destinations** provide recurring data exports to cloud storage and data warehouse platforms, supporting both raw events and merged user ID tables with configurable sync frequencies and historical backfill capabilities.

### Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Amplitude ID (amplitude_id)**: The primary user identifier in Amplitude's system, used for deduplication and user tracking across sessions.

**Cohort Sync Cadence**: The frequency at which cohort membership updates are sent to destinations (real-time, hourly, daily, or scheduled).

**User ID Mapping**: The process of matching Amplitude's user_id field to corresponding identifiers in destination platforms (email, external_id, customer_id, etc.).

**Event Streaming**: Real-time forwarding of user events and properties from Amplitude to destination platforms as they occur.

**Merged User IDs**: Deduplicated user records that combine multiple Amplitude IDs belonging to the same user across devices and sessions.

**Behavioral Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments created in Amplitude based on user actions, properties, and engagement patterns.

### Authentication and Configuration Patterns

Most destinations follow standardized authentication patterns:

- **API Key Authentication**: Simple token-based authentication using destination platform API keys
- **OAuth Authentication**: Secure authorization flow for platforms like Google, Facebook, and HubSpot
- **Service Account Authentication**: JSON key-based authentication for cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- **Bearer Token Authentication**: Token-based authentication with Authorization headers

### Data Warehouse and Cloud Storage Integrations

The catalog includes comprehensive support for major cloud platforms:

**Amazon Web Services**: Kinesis Data Streams, Kinesis Firehose, S3, and Redshift integrations with IAM role-based authentication using Amplitude's account ID 358203115967.

**Google Cloud Platform**: BigQuery, Cloud Storage, and Pub/Sub integrations requiring service accounts with specific IAM roles and permissions.

**Microsoft Azure**: Blob Storage integration with service principal authentication and container-level permissions.

**Snowflake**: Bidirectional integration supporting both password and key pair authentication with recurring sync capabilities.

### Marketing and Advertising Platform Integrations

The catalog provides extensive coverage of advertising networks and marketing platforms:

**Ad Networks**: Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads, Snapchat Ads, LinkedIn Ads, and Twitter Ads with cohort syncing for audience targeting and event streaming for conversion tracking.

**Marketing Automation**: HubSpot, Marketo, Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Braze, Iterable, and Customer.io with both event streaming and cohort syncing capabilities.

**Email Marketing**: Mailchimp, SendGrid, and Klaviyo with cohort-based audience segmentation and campaign targeting.

### Customer Engagement and Product Platforms

**Customer Engagement**: Intercom, Zendesk-adjacent platforms, and communication tools supporting real-time event streaming and cohort-based targeting.

**Product Analytics and Experimentation**: Optimizely, Split, LaunchDarkly, and VWO for feature flag targeting and A/B testing with cohort-based audience segmentation.

**In-App Messaging and Onboarding**: Appcues, CommandBar, Chameleon, and Userflow for personalized user experiences based on behavioral cohorts.

### Data Processing and Rate Limiting

Most streaming destinations implement standardized rate limiting and data processing constraints:

- **Request Size Limits**: Typically 2MB maximum request size with 429 response handling
- **Event Property Limits**: Varying limits on custom properties (e.g., HubSpot's 50 custom properties per event)
- **Rate Limiting**: Platform-specific API rate limits with exponential backoff retry mechanisms
- **User Identifier Requirements**: Mandatory user ID mapping to prevent duplication and ensure proper data attribution

### Regional and Compliance Considerations

Many destinations support regional data centers and compliance requirements:

- **Data Residency**: EU, US, and Asia-Pacific regional endpoints for platforms like CleverTap and Customer.io
- **PII Handling**: SHA256 hashing requirements for personally identifiable information in advertising platforms
- **GDPR Compliance**: Automatic data handling compliance for European user data

### API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

The catalog includes specific technical implementation details:

**Webhook Destinations**: Custom webhook endpoints with Apache FreeMarker templating for payload customization and configurable headers.

**SDK Plugins**: Browser-based destination plugins for platforms like Google Tag Manager, Hotjar, and FullStory using Amplitude's DestinationPlugin architecture.

**Batch Processing**: Micro-batch file processing for warehouse destinations with hourly partitioning and deduplication functions.

The destination catalog represents Amplitude's comprehensive approach to data activation, enabling businesses to leverage behavioral analytics across their entire technology stack while maintaining data consistency, security, and compliance standards.
