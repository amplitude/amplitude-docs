## Amplitude Destination Catalog

Amplitude's destination catalog represents a comprehensive ecosystem of integrations that enable businesses to activate their behavioral analytics data across marketing, product, and customer engagement platforms. The catalog encompasses over 100 destinations spanning event streaming, cohort synchronization, and data warehousing capabilities.

### Core Integration Architecture

The destination catalog operates on three primary integration patterns:

**Event Streaming Destinations** forward real-time user events and properties from Amplitude to external platforms using APIs like HTTP V2 and Identify API. These integrations enable immediate activation of behavioral data for personalization, attribution, and customer engagement workflows.

**Cohort Sync Destinations** export Amplitude's behavioral cohorts to marketing automation, experimentation, and advertising platforms. Cohorts can be synchronized on various cadences (real-time, hourly, daily, scheduled) and support different sync types including one-time exports and recurring updates.

**Warehouse Destinations** provide bulk data export capabilities to cloud storage and data warehouse platforms, supporting recurring syncs, historical backfills, and structured data schemas for analytics and machine learning workflows.

### Key Platform Categories

**Marketing Automation & CRM**: Integrations with platforms like HubSpot, Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Braze, Customer.io, and Iterable enable sophisticated lifecycle marketing campaigns driven by behavioral triggers and cohort membership.

**Advertising Networks**: Destinations for Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads, LinkedIn Ads, and Snapchat enable first-party behavioral data activation for audience targeting, conversion tracking, and campaign optimization.

**Product Experience Platforms**: Integrations with tools like Appcues, CommandBar, Userflow, and Chameleon power personalized in-app experiences, onboarding flows, and feature adoption campaigns based on user behavior patterns.

**Experimentation & Feature Management**: Platforms like Optimizely, LaunchDarkly, Split, and Statsig receive cohort data for targeted experiments and feature flag rollouts based on behavioral segmentation.

**Data Infrastructure**: Cloud platforms including Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Snowflake, BigQuery, and Azure Blob Storage support enterprise data workflows with configurable export formats and scheduling.

### Authentication & Configuration Patterns

Most destinations require platform-specific authentication credentials:
- **API Keys**: Simple token-based authentication for platforms like Braze, Mixpanel, and Intercom
- **OAuth**: Secure authorization flows for platforms like Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and HubSpot
- **Service Accounts**: Cloud platform integrations using JSON key files or IAM roles
- **Custom Tokens**: Platform-specific authentication like Amplitude API keys or bearer tokens

User identifier mapping is critical across integrations, supporting various ID types including email addresses, user IDs, device identifiers (IDFA, GAID), and platform-specific IDs with automatic hashing for PII protection where required.

### Data Transformation & Filtering

Destinations support sophisticated data transformation capabilities:
- **Event Filtering**: Selective forwarding of specific events based on event names or properties
- **Property Mapping**: Custom field mapping between Amplitude properties and destination schemas  
- **Template Customization**: Apache FreeMarker templating for webhook payloads and custom data formats
- **Schema Transformation**: Automatic conversion between Amplitude's event format and destination-specific schemas

### Rate Limiting & Delivery Guarantees

The platform implements robust delivery mechanisms with platform-specific rate limiting, retry logic with exponential backoff, and delivery status monitoring. Most integrations support 2MB request limits with 429 rate limiting responses and automatic retry mechanisms.

### Enterprise Features

Advanced capabilities include IP allowlisting for secure data transfer, custom webhook endpoints with configurable headers, historical data backfills, and comprehensive audit logging. Data export formats support JSON, CSV, and platform-specific schemas with automatic compression and partitioning.

The destination catalog represents Amplitude's commitment to enabling comprehensive customer data activation across the modern marketing and product technology stack, providing the infrastructure for data-driven customer experiences at scale.
