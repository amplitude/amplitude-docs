## Amplitude Destination Catalog

Amplitude's destination catalog represents a comprehensive ecosystem of integrations that enable businesses to activate their behavioral analytics data across marketing, product, and customer engagement platforms. The catalog encompasses over 100 destinations spanning event streaming, cohort synchronization, and data warehousing capabilities.

### Core Integration Types and Architecture

The destination catalog operates through three primary integration patterns:

**Event Streaming Destinations** forward real-time user events and properties from Amplitude to external platforms using APIs like HTTP V2 and Identify API. These integrations typically require authentication tokens, user ID mapping, and support event filtering with property transformations.

**Cohort Sync Destinations** export Amplitude's behavioral cohorts to marketing automation, experimentation, and customer engagement platforms. These integrations enable audience targeting by syncing user segments with configurable cadences (real-time, hourly, daily, or scheduled).

**Warehouse Destinations** provide bulk data export capabilities to cloud storage and data warehouse platforms, supporting recurring syncs of raw events, merged user IDs, and historical backfills with specific schema formats.

### Key Platform Categories and Use Cases

**Marketing Automation & Customer Engagement**: Platforms like Braze, Customer.io, Klaviyo, HubSpot, Mailchimp, and Iterable receive cohorts and events for personalized messaging campaigns across email, SMS, push notifications, and in-app channels.

**Advertising & Attribution**: Ad network integrations including Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads, LinkedIn Ads, Snapchat Ads, and Twitter Ads enable behavioral audience targeting and conversion tracking through cohort syncing and event streaming.

**Product Experience & Onboarding**: Platforms like Appcues, CommandBar, Userflow, Candu, and Plotline use Amplitude cohorts to trigger personalized in-app experiences, product tours, tooltips, and onboarding flows.

**Experimentation & Feature Management**: Tools like Optimizely, LaunchDarkly, Split, and Statsig leverage Amplitude cohorts for experiment targeting and feature flag segmentation based on behavioral data.

**Data Infrastructure**: Cloud platforms including Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Snowflake, BigQuery, and Azure Blob Storage support large-scale data export with specific IAM configurations and schema requirements.

### Authentication and Configuration Patterns

Most destinations require **API key authentication** with platform-specific credentials (REST API keys, access tokens, client secrets). Advanced integrations use **OAuth authentication** for secure authorization flows.

**User ID mapping** is critical across integrations, typically requiring correspondence between Amplitude's `user_id` field and destination platform identifiers (email addresses, external IDs, device identifiers like IDFA/AAID).

**Property mapping** enables transformation of Amplitude event properties and user properties to destination-specific field formats, with many platforms supporting custom field creation.

### Sync Mechanisms and Data Flow

**Real-time sync** capabilities enable immediate cohort updates and event forwarding with sub-minute latency for time-sensitive use cases like triggered campaigns.

**Scheduled sync cadences** provide configurable timing (hourly, daily, weekly) for batch cohort updates and data exports.

**Bidirectional integrations** with platforms like VWO and Cordial enable data flow from external platforms back to Amplitude for comprehensive analytics.

### Technical Specifications and Limitations

Event streaming destinations typically support **2MB request size limits** with **429 rate limiting** responses and retry mechanisms with exponential backoff.

Cohort sync destinations often have **user count thresholds** (minimum 100-1000 users) and **population delays** (6-48 hours) for audience activation.

Data warehouse destinations require specific **IAM role configurations** with precise permissions for services like `kinesis:PutRecord`, `bigquery.transfers.get`, and `storage.objects.create`.

### Advanced Features and Customization

**Apache FreeMarker templating** in webhook destinations enables custom payload transformation with variables like `${cohort_id}`, `${in_cohort}`, and `${computed_time}`.

**Event filtering** capabilities allow selective forwarding of specific events and properties to optimize data transfer and platform costs.

**Device identifier support** includes IDFA, AAID, IDFV, Android ID, and emerging identifiers like Unified ID 2.0 (UID2) for cross-platform user matching.

The destination catalog represents Amplitude's commitment to data activation, enabling businesses to operationalize behavioral insights across their entire technology stack through standardized integration patterns and comprehensive platform coverage.
