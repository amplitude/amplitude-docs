## Amplitude Destination Catalog

Amplitude's destination catalog represents a comprehensive ecosystem of data integration endpoints that enable businesses to activate their behavioral analytics data across marketing, customer engagement, experimentation, and data infrastructure platforms. The catalog encompasses over 100 destination integrations spanning cohort syncing, event streaming, and raw data exports to power data-driven customer experiences.

## Core Integration Categories and Architecture

The destination catalog operates through three primary integration patterns:

**Cohort Syncing Destinations** enable behavioral audience segmentation by exporting user cohorts from Amplitude to marketing automation platforms, customer engagement tools, and advertising networks. These integrations typically require user identifier mapping (email, user_id, device IDs) and support scheduled, one-time, or real-time sync cadences.

**Event Streaming Destinations** provide real-time forwarding of user events and properties from Amplitude to downstream platforms using APIs like HTTP V2, Identify API, and platform-specific endpoints. These integrations support selective event filtering, property mapping, and user profile synchronization.

**Raw Data Export Destinations** facilitate data warehouse and cloud storage integrations for analytics, machine learning, and business intelligence use cases through recurring exports of event tables, merged user data, and cohort membership files.

## Key Platform Integrations and Use Cases

### Marketing Automation and Customer Engagement
The catalog includes extensive integrations with marketing platforms like **Braze**, **Customer.io**, **Iterable**, **Klaviyo**, **Mailchimp**, and **SendGrid** for email marketing campaigns. These destinations typically require API key authentication and support both cohort syncing for audience targeting and event streaming for behavioral triggers.

**HubSpot** integrations (both cohort sync and event streaming v2) enable CRM workflow automation and lead scoring, requiring HubSpot Enterprise subscriptions and supporting up to 50 custom properties per event with p95 latency targets of 60 seconds.

### Advertising and Attribution Networks
Ad network destinations including **Facebook Ads**, **Google Ads**, **TikTok Ads**, **Snapchat Ads**, and **Twitter Ads** enable audience creation and conversion tracking. These integrations require device identifier mapping (IDFA, GAID), SHA256 encryption for PII fields, and support various match types including email, phone numbers, and mobile advertising IDs.

**Google Ads** provides both cohort syncing for audience targeting and event streaming using the Upload Click Conversions API, requiring Google Click ID (gclid) parameters for attribution tracking.

### Experimentation and Feature Management
Experimentation platforms like **Optimizely**, **LaunchDarkly**, **Split**, and **Statsig** enable behavioral cohort targeting for A/B tests and feature flags. These integrations support user identifier mapping and workspace/environment configuration for targeted experiments.

### Data Infrastructure and Warehousing
Cloud storage and data warehouse destinations include **Amazon S3**, **Google Cloud Storage**, **Azure Blob Storage**, **Snowflake**, **Google BigQuery**, and **Amazon Redshift**. These integrations support:

- **Hourly recurring exports** with server_upload_time partitioning
- **Historical data backfills** for complete data migration
- **Merged Amplitude ID exports** for user identity resolution
- **Event table schemas** with JSON/SUPER data types for event_properties and user_properties
- **IAM role-based authentication** with specific permission requirements

**Snowflake** integration includes both standard destination exports and **Snowflake Data Share** for native data sharing, with regional limitations (US West Oregon/AWS only) and specific table schemas including amplitude_id, event_properties, and merge_event_time fields.

### Customer Success and Product Analytics
Product-focused destinations like **Amplitude Activation**, **Appcues**, **CommandBar**, **Userflow**, and **Candu** enable in-app messaging, onboarding flows, and product tours based on behavioral cohorts.

**Planhat** integration streams user activities for customer health scoring and success workflows, requiring user_id to externalId matching and Tenant Token authentication.

## Authentication and Configuration Patterns

### API Key Authentication
Most destinations use API key authentication with platform-specific requirements:
- **REST API Keys** for platforms like Braze, Customer.io, Iterable
- **Bearer Token authentication** for services like Aampe, Meta Pixel
- **OAuth authentication** for platforms like HubSpot, Google services

### User Identifier Mapping
Critical for data synchronization across platforms:
- **Email addresses** for marketing automation platforms
- **Device identifiers** (IDFA, GAID, Android ID) for mobile attribution
- **Custom user IDs** for platform-specific matching
- **External IDs** for CRM and customer success platforms

### Sync Cadence Configuration
Destinations support various sync frequencies:
- **Real-time syncing** for immediate data activation
- **Scheduled syncs** (hourly, daily) for batch processing
- **One-time syncs** for initial data migration
- **Manual backfills** for historical data export

## Data Transformation and Filtering

### Event and Property Filtering
Most streaming destinations support:
- **Send Events filters** for selective event forwarding
- **Event Properties filters** for specific data field transmission
- **User Properties filters** for profile synchronization control

### Payload Customization
Advanced destinations like **Webhooks** and **Cohort Webhooks** support **Apache FreeMarker templating** for custom payload formatting, enabling flexible data transformation and custom header configuration.

### Size and Rate Limitations
Common technical constraints include:
- **2MB request size limits** for many streaming destinations
- **429 rate limiting** with exponential backoff retry mechanisms
- **Platform-specific API limits** (e.g., HubSpot Enterprise requirements)

## Specialized Integration Features

### Cohort Webhook Destinations
Enable real-time cohort updates with configurable templates, supporting variables like cohort_id, cohort_name, in_cohort boolean, computed_time, and message_id for deduplication.

### SDK Plugin Architecture
Destinations like **FullStory**, **Hotjar**, and **Google Tag Manager** use Amplitude's DestinationPlugin architecture for client-side event forwarding through browser SDKs.

### Multi-Platform Support
Many destinations require separate configurations per platform (iOS/Android) or support multiple identifier types for cross-platform user matching.

The Amplitude destination catalog represents a comprehensive data activation ecosystem enabling businesses to leverage behavioral analytics across their entire technology stack, from real-time personalization to data warehouse analytics and everything in between.
