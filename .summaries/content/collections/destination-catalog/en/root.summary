## Amplitude Destination Catalog

Amplitude's destination catalog represents a comprehensive ecosystem of data integration endpoints that enable organizations to activate their behavioral analytics data across marketing, customer engagement, experimentation, and business intelligence platforms. The catalog encompasses over 100 destination integrations spanning multiple categories including event streaming, cohort synchronization, data warehousing, and specialized use cases.

### Core Integration Architecture

The destination catalog operates on three primary integration patterns:

**Event Streaming Destinations** forward real-time user events and properties from Amplitude to external platforms using APIs like HTTP V2 and Identify API. These integrations typically require authentication tokens, support event filtering, and maintain user property mappings between platforms.

**Cohort Sync Destinations** export Amplitude's behavioral cohorts to marketing automation, experimentation, and customer engagement platforms. These integrations enable audience targeting by synchronizing user segments based on behavioral criteria, supporting various sync cadences (real-time, hourly, daily, scheduled).

**Data Warehouse Destinations** provide bulk export capabilities to cloud storage and analytics platforms, supporting recurring syncs, historical backfills, and structured data schemas for downstream analysis.

### Key Platform Categories

**Marketing Automation & Customer Engagement** platforms dominate the catalog, including integrations with Braze, Customer.io, HubSpot, Mailchimp, Klaviyo, and Salesforce Marketing Cloud. These destinations typically require API key authentication and support both event streaming and cohort synchronization for personalized campaign targeting.

**Advertising Networks** enable audience activation across Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads, LinkedIn Ads, Snapchat Ads, and Twitter Ads. These integrations focus on cohort syncing with specific identifier requirements (IDFA, GAID, email hashing) and support custom audience creation for retargeting campaigns.

**Experimentation Platforms** like Optimizely, LaunchDarkly, Split, and Statsig enable feature flag targeting and A/B testing using Amplitude cohorts, supporting behavior-based experimentation workflows.

**Data Infrastructure** destinations include major cloud platforms (Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage), data warehouses (Snowflake, Google BigQuery, Amazon Redshift), and streaming platforms (Amazon Kinesis, Google Pub/Sub) for enterprise data pipeline integration.

### Authentication & Configuration Patterns

Most destinations follow standardized authentication patterns:
- **API Key Authentication**: Simple token-based access for platforms like Braze, Customer.io, and most marketing tools
- **OAuth Authentication**: Secure delegated access for platforms like HubSpot, Facebook Ads, and Google services
- **Service Account Authentication**: Enterprise-grade access for cloud platforms using JSON keys and IAM roles
- **Custom Authentication**: Platform-specific methods like Salesforce Marketing Cloud's Client ID/Secret/Subdomain combination

### User Identification & Mapping

Destinations require specific user identifier mappings between Amplitude and target platforms:
- **Email-based mapping** for marketing platforms (Mailchimp, Klaviyo, SendGrid)
- **Device ID mapping** (IDFA, GAID, Android ID) for mobile attribution and advertising
- **Custom User ID mapping** for internal platform identifiers
- **Multiple identifier support** for comprehensive user matching across touchpoints

### Data Payload Structures

Event streaming destinations typically support:
- **Event properties** with platform-specific field mapping and size limitations
- **User properties** for profile enrichment and segmentation
- **Custom attributes** mapped to destination-specific schemas
- **Timestamp formatting** and timezone handling for accurate event sequencing

Cohort sync destinations provide:
- **JSON payload structures** with cohort metadata (cohort_name, cohort_id, in_cohort boolean)
- **User arrays** containing user_properties and identifiers
- **Computed_time** and message_id for deduplication and sync tracking
- **Batch processing** for efficient large-scale cohort updates

### Rate Limiting & Performance Considerations

Destinations implement various performance constraints:
- **Request size limits** (commonly 2MB for event streaming)
- **Rate limiting** with 429 response handling and exponential backoff
- **Batch processing** for cohort syncs to optimize API usage
- **Retry mechanisms** with configurable attempts and timeouts

### Specialized Use Cases

**Customer Success Platforms** (Planhat, Gainsight integrations) focus on user activity streaming for health scoring and workflow automation.

**Product Analytics Enhancement** destinations like FullStory, Hotjar, and Mixpanel enable cross-platform behavioral analysis.

**Qualitative Feedback Integration** platforms (Maze, Qualtrics, Refiner) combine quantitative behavioral data with survey responses and user research.

**Attribution & Mobile Marketing** destinations (AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch, Kochava) support mobile app attribution and deep linking workflows.

### Enterprise Data Warehouse Integration

Major cloud data warehouse destinations support:
- **Recurring sync schedules** with hourly, daily, or custom cadences
- **Historical data backfill** capabilities for complete data migration
- **Schema management** with predefined table structures for events and user data
- **Deduplication functions** for handling duplicate events during export processes
- **Partitioning strategies** by timestamp fields for query optimization

The destination catalog represents Amplitude's commitment to data activation across the modern marketing and analytics technology stack, enabling organizations to leverage behavioral insights for personalized customer experiences, data-driven experimentation, and comprehensive business intelligence workflows.
