# Amplitude Destination Catalog

## Product Overview

Amplitude's Destination Catalog is a comprehensive integration hub that enables businesses to activate their product analytics data by connecting Amplitude with various third-party platforms. This feature allows companies to sync user cohorts, stream events, and share user profiles with external tools to create personalized experiences, targeted marketing campaigns, and optimize product development based on behavioral data.

The Destination Catalog supports over 100 integrations across multiple categories including marketing automation, customer engagement, advertising platforms, data warehouses, experimentation tools, and product experience platforms. These integrations enable a bidirectional flow of data, allowing businesses to not only export data from Amplitude but also enrich their analytics with data from other sources.

## Key Features and Concepts

1. **Cohort Syncing**: Export behavioral user segments from Amplitude to destination platforms for targeted messaging, personalization, and marketing campaigns.

2. **Event Streaming**: Forward real-time event data from Amplitude to external platforms to trigger actions, update user profiles, and power personalized experiences.

3. **Data Export**: Send raw event data and merged user IDs to data warehouses and storage solutions for custom analysis and long-term storage.

4. **User Profile API**: Share user properties, computed properties, and recommendations with external platforms for personalized content generation.

- User identifier mapping (matching Amplitude user_id to destination platform identifiers)
- Event property mapping
- User property forwarding options
- Custom field mappings

### Sync Cadences

Depending on the destination, the catalog supports:
- Real-time syncing (events streamed as they occur)
- Minute-by-minute updates
- Hourly syncs
- Daily syncs
- One-time manual exports
