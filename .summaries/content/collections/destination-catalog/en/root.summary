# Amplitude Destination Catalog

## Product Overview

Amplitude's Destination Catalog is a comprehensive collection of integrations that enables businesses to activate their product analytics data across various marketing, customer engagement, and business intelligence platforms. The catalog facilitates the seamless flow of user data, events, and cohorts from Amplitude to third-party tools, allowing organizations to operationalize their analytics insights without complex engineering work.

The Destination Catalog supports two primary types of data synchronization:
1. **Event Streaming** - Real-time forwarding of Amplitude events and user properties to destination platforms
2. **Cohort Syncing** - Exporting user segments created in Amplitude to destination platforms for targeted engagement

These integrations enable various use cases including personalized marketing campaigns, targeted product experiences, advertising optimization, data warehousing, and cross-platform analytics.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Cohort** - A group of users who share common characteristics or behaviors, created in Amplitude based on user properties or event patterns

2. **Sync Cadence** - The frequency at which data is synchronized between Amplitude and destination platforms (one-time, hourly, daily, real-time)

3. **User ID Mapping** - The configuration that determines how user identities in Amplitude are matched to identities in destination platforms

4. **Event Filtering** - The ability to select which events from Amplitude are forwarded to destination platforms

5. **User Property Forwarding** - The ability to select which user properties from Amplitude are sent to destination platforms

6. **API Key/Secret** - Authentication credentials required to establish connections between Amplitude and destination platforms

7. **Identify Forwarding** - The capability to send user identification events from Amplitude to destination platforms

8. **Backfill** - The process of exporting historical data from Amplitude to a destination platform

9. **Merged User IDs** - A table that maps multiple user identifiers to a single canonical user ID in Amplitude

10. **Destination Plugin** - A JavaScript implementation that enables custom integrations with web-based platforms

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's Destination Catalog is part of Amplitude's broader Customer Data Platform (CDP) offering, which includes:

1. **Amplitude Analytics** - The core analytics platform that collects and analyzes user behavior data

2. **Amplitude Data** - The data management layer that processes, stores, and prepares data for activation

3. **Amplitude Audiences** - The segmentation engine that creates and manages user cohorts

The Destination Catalog serves as the activation layer of this ecosystem, enabling businesses to operationalize insights from Amplitude across their tech stack. Many integrations require paid Amplitude plans, particularly those involving cohort syncing.

The catalog supports various authentication methods including API keys, OAuth, service account credentials, and custom tokens depending on the destination platform. Most integrations are maintained by Amplitude, while some are partner-maintained.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

For custom implementations, Amplitude provides several key endpoints:

1. **Cohort Webhooks**
   - Endpoint: Custom webhook URL configured by the user
   - Authentication: Custom headers
   - Payload: Customizable using FreeMarker templates
   - Example template:
     ```
     {
       "cohort_id": ${cohort_id},
       "cohort_name": "${cohort_name}",
       "computed_at": "${computed_at}",
       "users": [
         <#list users as user>
         {
           "user_id": "${user.user_id}",
           "in_cohort": ${user.in_cohort?string("true", "false")},
           <#if user.user_properties??>
           "user_properties": {
             <#list user.user_properties as property, value>
             "${property}": <#if value?is_string>"${value}"<#else>${value}</#if><#if property_has_next>,</#if>
             </#list>
           }
           </#if>
         }<#if user_has_next>,</#if>
         </#list>
       ]
     }
     ```

2. **Event Streaming Webhooks**
