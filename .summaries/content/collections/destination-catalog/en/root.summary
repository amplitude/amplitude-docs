# Amplitude Destination Catalog

## Product Overview

Amplitude's Destination Catalog is a comprehensive integration hub that enables businesses to activate their product analytics data by connecting Amplitude with various third-party platforms. This feature allows organizations to sync user cohorts, stream events, and share user profiles with external systems to drive personalized marketing campaigns, product experiences, and business workflows.

The Destination Catalog supports over 100 integrations across multiple categories including marketing automation, customer engagement, advertising platforms, data warehouses, experimentation tools, and customer success platforms. These integrations enable businesses to operationalize their product analytics insights without requiring extensive engineering resources.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Integration Types

1. **Cohort Sync**: Allows exporting behavioral user segments from Amplitude to destination platforms for targeted marketing, personalization, and engagement.

2. **Event Streaming**: Enables real-time forwarding of Amplitude events and user properties to external platforms for triggering workflows and enriching user profiles.

3. **Data Export**: Facilitates bulk transfer of Amplitude event data and merged user IDs to data warehouses and storage platforms for advanced analytics.

4. **User Profile API**: Provides access to Amplitude user profiles including properties, cohort memberships, and recommendations for personalization engines.

### Core Capabilities

- **User Identity Mapping**: Configure how Amplitude user identifiers map to destination platform identifiers (email, user ID, device ID, etc.)
- **Property Selection**: Choose which event properties and user properties to include in the data transfer
- **Sync Cadence**: Set frequency of data syncing (real-time, hourly, daily, or on-demand)
- **Payload Customization**: Format data payloads using templates (particularly for webhook destinations)
- **Authentication Methods**: Support for various authentication mechanisms (API keys, OAuth, service accounts)
- **Filtering**: Specify which events or users should be included in the data transfer

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Cohort**: A group of users who share common behaviors or attributes in Amplitude
- **Destination**: A third-party platform that receives data from Amplitude
- **Event**: A user action or system occurrence tracked in Amplitude
- **User Property**: Attributes associated with a user in Amplitude
- **API Key/Secret**: Authentication credentials required to establish connections with destinations
- **Sync Cadence**: The frequency at which data is transferred (real-time, hourly, daily)
- **Webhook**: A custom HTTP endpoint that can receive data from Amplitude
- **OAuth**: An authentication protocol used by some destinations for secure access
- **Service Account**: A special type of account used for server-to-server authentication
- **IAM Role**: Identity and Access Management role used for AWS integrations
- **Merged User**: Records that track when multiple user IDs belong to the same user

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's Destination Catalog is a core component of Amplitude's broader Customer Data Platform (CDP) capabilities. It works in conjunction with other Amplitude products:

1. **Amplitude Analytics**: Provides the behavioral data and cohorts that can be activated through the Destination Catalog

2. **Amplitude Data**: Manages the data pipeline that powers the Destination Catalog integrations

3. **Amplitude Experiment**: Can leverage cohorts exported to experimentation platforms for targeted testing

The Destination Catalog serves as the activation layer in Amplitude's overall data stack, enabling the "action" phase after data collection and analysis. It completes the analytics lifecycle by allowing businesses to operationalize insights derived from Amplitude.

## Common API Endpoints and Authentication Methods

### Authentication Methods

1. **API Key/Token**: Most destinations require an API key or token from the destination platform
2. **OAuth**: Some destinations like Facebook Ads, Google Ads use OAuth authentication
3. **Service Account Credentials**: AWS and Google Cloud integrations use service accounts
4. **Basic Authentication**: Username/password for some platforms
5. **Bearer Token**: Used by platforms like Aampe for authentication

### Common API Patterns

For cohort syncing, the typical API pattern involves:
```
POST /api/2/cohorts/sync
{
  "destination_id": "destination_id",
  "cohort_id": "cohort_id",
  "sync_type": "one_time|scheduled"
}
```

For webhook destinations, custom payloads can be defined using FreeMarker templates:
```
{
  "user_id": "${user_id}",
  "cohort_id": "${cohort_id}",
  "in_cohort": ${in_cohort?c},
  "properties": {
    <#list user_properties as property, value>
    "${property}": "${value}"<#sep>,</#sep>
    </#list>
  }
}
```
