## Amplitude Destination Catalog

Amplitude's destination catalog represents a comprehensive ecosystem of integrations that enable businesses to activate their behavioral analytics data across marketing, customer engagement, experimentation, and data infrastructure platforms. The catalog encompasses over 100 destination integrations spanning multiple categories including event streaming, cohort syncing, data warehousing, and specialized use cases.

## Product Architecture and Integration Types

The destination catalog operates through several core integration patterns:

**Event Streaming Destinations** forward real-time user events and properties from Amplitude to external platforms using APIs like HTTP V2 API and Identify API. These integrations typically require authentication tokens, support event filtering, and handle user property mapping between platforms.

**Cohort Sync Destinations** export Amplitude's behavioral cohorts to marketing automation, customer engagement, and experimentation platforms. These integrations enable audience targeting, personalized campaigns, and A/B testing based on user behavior patterns analyzed in Amplitude.

**Data Warehouse Destinations** provide recurring data exports to cloud storage and analytics platforms including Amazon S3, Google BigQuery, Snowflake, and Azure Blob Storage. These support historical data backfills, hourly sync cadences, and structured schemas for events and merged user data.

**Raw Events Integration** enables bidirectional data flow and ETL processes through platforms like Fivetran, supporting automated data pipeline creation with configurable sync frequencies.

## Key Platform Categories and Use Cases

**Marketing Automation & Customer Engagement** platforms like Braze, Customer.io, Klaviyo, HubSpot, and Salesforce Marketing Cloud enable personalized messaging campaigns based on behavioral cohorts and real-time event triggers.

**Experimentation & Feature Management** integrations with Optimizely, LaunchDarkly, Split, and Statsig allow feature flag targeting and experiment audience creation using Amplitude's behavioral segmentation.

**Advertising & Attribution** destinations including Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads, and Snapchat enable audience creation for retargeting campaigns and conversion tracking through pixel integrations.

**Customer Success & Product Analytics** platforms like Planhat, Productboard, and various feedback tools combine quantitative behavioral data with qualitative insights for product optimization.

**In-App Experience Platforms** such as Appcues, CommandBar, Userflow, and Chameleon enable personalized onboarding, product tours, and contextual messaging based on user behavior patterns.

## Technical Implementation Patterns

**Authentication Methods** vary by platform but commonly include API keys, OAuth tokens, service account credentials, and webhook configurations. Many integrations require specific permission scopes and role-based access controls.

**User Identification Mapping** is critical across integrations, supporting various identifier types including user_id, email addresses, device IDs (IDFA, GAID), external IDs, and platform-specific identifiers. Many platforms require SHA256 hashing for PII data.

**Data Transformation and Filtering** capabilities allow selective event forwarding, property mapping, and payload customization using templating languages like Apache FreeMarker for webhook destinations.

**Sync Cadences** range from real-time streaming to scheduled intervals (hourly, daily) depending on the destination type and use case requirements.

## Data Schema and Export Formats

**Event Data Structure** typically includes core fields like amplitude_id, user_id, event_type, event_properties, user_properties, and timestamps, with platform-specific transformations for destination compatibility.

**Cohort Export Formats** commonly include user arrays with cohort membership flags (in_cohort boolean), computed timestamps, message IDs for deduplication, and user property mappings.

**Warehouse Exports** utilize structured schemas with partitioning by server_upload_time, support for JSON/SUPER data types for nested properties, and deduplication functions for handling duplicate events.

## Integration Management and Monitoring

**Rate Limiting and Error Handling** mechanisms include exponential backoff retry policies, 429 throttling responses, request size limits (commonly 2MB), and delivery metrics for monitoring integration health.

**Payload Customization** through templating engines enables custom JSON schema transformations, header configurations, and platform-specific data formatting requirements.

**Sync Status and Notifications** provide email alerts for job completion, error reporting, and integration health monitoring across the destination ecosystem.

The destination catalog serves as Amplitude's primary data activation layer, enabling businesses to operationalize behavioral insights across their entire technology stack while maintaining data consistency, security, and scalability requirements.
