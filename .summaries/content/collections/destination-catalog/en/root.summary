## Amplitude Snowflake Destination Integration

Amplitude's Snowflake destination integration enables automated export of event data and merged user identities from Amplitude's analytics platform to Snowflake data warehouses. This integration supports recurring data synchronization, allowing organizations to consolidate their behavioral analytics data with other business data in their Snowflake environment for advanced analytics, reporting, and data science workflows.

## Product Relationships and Features

The Snowflake destination operates as part of Amplitude's broader warehouse destinations ecosystem, functioning as a data pipeline that exports processed analytics data from Amplitude's core platform. The integration supports two primary data export types:

**Event Data Export**: Transfers detailed behavioral event data including user actions, properties, and metadata to designated Snowflake tables with comprehensive schema mapping.

**Merged User Data Export**: Synchronizes user identity resolution data, enabling consistent user tracking across different identifiers through merged_amplitude_id relationships.

The integration utilizes micro-batch file processing for efficient data transfer and supports both historical data backfills and ongoing incremental syncs. Data filtering capabilities allow selective export based on specific criteria, optimizing storage costs and transfer efficiency.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**amplitude_id**: Primary user identifier in Amplitude's system, serving as the core reference for user behavior tracking and analytics.

**merged_amplitude_id**: Consolidated user identifier that represents the resolved identity when multiple amplitude_ids are determined to belong to the same user through Amplitude's identity resolution process.

**VARIANT Columns**: Snowflake's semi-structured data type used to store JSON-formatted event properties and user attributes, enabling flexible schema evolution without requiring table alterations.

**Micro-batch Files**: Small, incremental data files used for efficient data transfer, reducing processing overhead and enabling near real-time data availability.

**Key Pair Authentication**: Preferred authentication method using RSA public/private key pairs for secure, scalable connection establishment, replacing deprecated password-based authentication.

**ORGNAME-ACCOUNTNAME Format**: Snowflake account identifier structure required for connection configuration, combining organization and account names for proper routing.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The Snowflake destination integrates within Amplitude's comprehensive data infrastructure as part of the warehouse destinations portfolio. This positioning enables organizations to create unified data architectures where Amplitude's behavioral analytics data flows seamlessly into enterprise data warehouses alongside other business systems.

The integration supports Amplitude's identity resolution capabilities by exporting merged user data, ensuring consistent user tracking across the entire data ecosystem. This enables downstream analytics tools, business intelligence platforms, and machine learning pipelines to leverage Amplitude's sophisticated user identity management.

## Technical Implementation Details

**Authentication Configuration**: The integration requires key pair authentication setup with JWT token validation, moving away from password-based methods for enhanced security and scalability.

**Network Security**: IP allowlisting requirements ensure secure data transfer, with specific IP ranges that must be configured in Snowflake's network policies.

**Schema Management**: Automated table creation and management with predefined schemas for both event and merged user data, utilizing VARIANT columns for flexible JSON data storage.

**Cost Optimization**: Auto-suspend configuration recommendations help manage Snowflake compute costs by automatically suspending warehouses during idle periods.

**Data Export Filtering**: Configurable filtering options enable selective data export, reducing unnecessary data transfer and storage costs while maintaining data relevance.

The integration emphasizes computation cost optimization through efficient micro-batch processing and provides comprehensive schema documentation to facilitate downstream data consumption and analysis workflows.
