## Amplitude Destination Catalog

Amplitude's destination catalog represents a comprehensive ecosystem of integrations that enable businesses to activate their behavioral analytics data across marketing, customer engagement, experimentation, and data infrastructure platforms. The catalog encompasses over 100 destinations spanning cohort syncing, event streaming, and data warehousing capabilities.

## Core Integration Types and Architecture

The destination catalog operates through three primary integration patterns:

**Cohort Syncing Destinations** enable behavioral audience export from Amplitude to marketing and engagement platforms. These integrations sync user segments based on behavioral criteria to platforms like Braze, HubSpot, Salesforce Marketing Cloud, and advertising networks including Facebook Ads, Google Ads, and TikTok Ads. Cohort destinations support various sync cadences (real-time, hourly, daily, scheduled) and user identifier matching including email, device IDs (IDFA, AAID), and custom user properties.

**Event Streaming Destinations** provide real-time forwarding of Amplitude events and user properties to downstream platforms. Key streaming integrations include Customer.io, Intercom, Mixpanel alternatives, and experimentation platforms like Optimizely and LaunchDarkly. Event streaming supports selective filtering, property mapping, and user creation/updates with configurable delivery mechanisms.

**Data Warehouse and Infrastructure Destinations** facilitate raw data export to cloud storage and analytics platforms including Amazon S3, Google BigQuery, Snowflake, Azure Blob Storage, and Amazon Kinesis. These destinations support recurring exports, historical backfills, and various data formats (JSON, CSV) with partitioning and deduplication capabilities.

## Key Platform Relationships and Ecosystem Integration

The destination catalog demonstrates Amplitude's position as a central behavioral analytics hub connecting to specialized platforms across the customer lifecycle:

**Marketing Automation Platforms** (HubSpot, Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Marketo, Mailchimp) receive behavioral cohorts for triggered campaigns and lead scoring based on product usage patterns.

**Customer Engagement Platforms** (Braze, Intercom, Customer.io, OneSignal) leverage real-time event streams and cohort data for personalized messaging across email, push notifications, SMS, and in-app channels.

**Experimentation and Feature Management** (Optimizely, LaunchDarkly, Split, Statsig) use behavioral cohorts for experiment targeting and feature flag audience definition.

**Advertising Networks** (Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads, Snapchat Ads) receive hashed user cohorts for custom audience creation and retargeting campaigns.

**Product Experience Platforms** (Appcues, Pendo alternatives, CommandBar, Userflow) sync behavioral data for personalized onboarding flows and in-product guidance.

## Technical Architecture and Authentication

Destinations employ diverse authentication mechanisms including:
- **API Key Authentication** (most common pattern)
- **OAuth 2.0** (HubSpot, Google platforms, Facebook)
- **Service Account Keys** (Google Cloud services, AWS IAM roles)
- **Bearer Token Authentication** (various SaaS platforms)

**Data Mapping and Transformation** capabilities include:
- User identifier mapping between Amplitude user_id and destination-specific IDs
- Property filtering and selective event forwarding
- Custom payload templating using Apache FreeMarker (webhooks, cohort webhooks)
- Automatic data type conversion and field mapping

**Rate Limiting and Delivery Guarantees** vary by destination with common patterns including:
- Request size limits (typically 2MB)
- Retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- 429 rate limiting handling
- Delivery status monitoring and error notifications

## Nomenclature and Key Concepts

**Amplitude Activation** refers to the product suite enabling destination integrations and behavioral cohort creation.

**Behavioral Cohorts** represent user segments defined by product usage patterns, event sequences, and user properties that can be synced to marketing platforms.

**User Properties vs Event Properties** distinction is critical for mapping - user properties represent persistent user attributes while event properties contain contextual event data.

**Amplitude ID** serves as the primary user identifier for data export, with merged Amplitude IDs handling user identity resolution across devices and sessions.

**Sync Cadences** include real-time, hourly, daily, and scheduled options depending on destination capabilities and use case requirements.

**Partner-Maintained vs Amplitude-Maintained** destinations indicate support responsibility and feature development ownership.

## Data Warehouse and Analytics Infrastructure

Cloud data warehouse destinations (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift) support enterprise analytics workflows with:
- **Recurring Export Schedules** with hourly micro-batch processing
- **Historical Backfill** capabilities for complete data migration
- **Schema Management** with predefined Event and Merged User table structures
- **Deduplication Functions** for handling duplicate events during processing
- **Partitioning Strategies** based on server_upload_time for query optimization

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

Key API patterns include:
- **Cohort Sync APIs** for behavioral audience export
- **Event Streaming APIs** using HTTP POST with JSON payloads
- **Webhook Destinations** with custom payload templating
- **Bulk Export APIs** for data warehouse integration

Common endpoint patterns:
- `/api/cohorts/sync` for cohort destination updates
- `/events/track` for event streaming destinations
- `/users/identify` for user property synchronization

The destination catalog represents Amplitude's comprehensive approach to customer data activation, enabling businesses to leverage behavioral analytics across their entire technology stack for personalized customer experiences and data-driven decision making.
