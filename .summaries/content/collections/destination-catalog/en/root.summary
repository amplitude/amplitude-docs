## Amplitude Destination Catalog

Amplitude's destination catalog represents a comprehensive ecosystem of over 100 integrations that enable businesses to activate their behavioral analytics data across marketing, product, and customer engagement platforms. The catalog serves as the central hub for connecting Amplitude's analytics insights to downstream tools and platforms for data-driven decision making and customer experience optimization.

### Core Integration Categories

The destination catalog encompasses several key integration types:

**Event Streaming Destinations** forward real-time user events and properties from Amplitude to external platforms, enabling immediate activation of behavioral data. These integrations typically use HTTP APIs and support selective event filtering, user property mapping, and real-time data transmission.

**Cohort Syncing Destinations** export user segments built in Amplitude to marketing automation, messaging, and experimentation platforms. Cohorts can be synchronized on various cadences (real-time, hourly, daily, or scheduled) and support different user identifier mappings (email, user_id, device IDs, etc.).

**Warehouse Destinations** provide bulk data export capabilities to cloud data warehouses and storage platforms, supporting historical backfills, recurring syncs, and structured data schemas for analytics and reporting.

**Raw Events Integrations** enable comprehensive data export and ETL workflows, typically providing JSON-formatted event data with full event properties and user attributes.

### Key Platform Relationships

The destination catalog integrates with major platform ecosystems:

**Marketing Automation Platforms** (HubSpot, Marketo, Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Braze, Customer.io) receive both event streams and cohort data for triggered campaigns, lead scoring, and personalized messaging workflows.

**Ad Networks** (Google Ads, Facebook Ads, TikTok Ads, LinkedIn Ads, Snapchat Ads) consume cohort data for audience targeting, lookalike modeling, and conversion tracking through their respective APIs.

**Customer Engagement Platforms** (Intercom, Zendesk, OneSignal, Airship) leverage behavioral cohorts and real-time events for contextual messaging, support workflows, and user engagement campaigns.

**Product Experience Tools** (LaunchDarkly, Optimizely, Split, Statsig) use cohort data for feature flag targeting, A/B testing, and experimentation audience creation.

**Data Infrastructure** (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, S3, Azure Blob Storage) receive structured event data for data warehousing, business intelligence, and advanced analytics workflows.

### Authentication and Configuration Patterns

Most destinations follow consistent authentication patterns:

**API Key Authentication** is the most common method, requiring platform-specific API keys, tokens, or secrets for secure data transmission.

**OAuth Authentication** is used for platforms requiring user consent and permission scoping (Google, Facebook, HubSpot, LinkedIn).

**Service Account Authentication** is employed for cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) using IAM roles, service account keys, and specific permission policies.

**User Identifier Mapping** is critical across all integrations, with common mapping fields including:
- Email addresses (most universal)
- Platform-specific user IDs
- Device identifiers (IDFA, GAID, Android ID)
- Custom user properties
- Hashed identifiers (SHA256) for privacy compliance

### Data Formats and Schemas

The catalog supports multiple data export formats:

**Amplitude Export API JSON Format** is the standard for event streaming, containing fields like `user_id`, `event_name`, `event_properties`, `user_properties`, `created_at`, and `amplitude_id`.

**Cohort Export Formats** typically include user identifiers, cohort membership status (`in_cohort` boolean), computed timestamps, and optional user properties.

**Warehouse Schemas** provide structured tables with specific column types:
- Event tables with partitioning by `server_upload_time` or `event_time`
- Merged user tables for identity resolution
- VARIANT/SUPER data types for JSON properties in Snowflake/Redshift
- Deduplication functions using `amplitude_id` and `uuid` fields

### Rate Limiting and Performance Considerations

Destinations implement various rate limiting and performance controls:

**Request Size Limits** typically range from 1-4MB per request, with some platforms supporting batch operations for efficiency.

**Rate Limiting** varies by platform, from hundreds of requests per minute to daily limits for audience operations.

**Retry Mechanisms** use exponential backoff with jitter for handling temporary failures and 429 throttling responses.

**Sync Cadences** range from real-time streaming to scheduled daily/weekly syncs, depending on use case requirements and platform capabilities.

### Privacy and Compliance Features

The catalog includes several privacy-focused capabilities:

**PII Hashing** automatically applies SHA256 encryption to email addresses and phone numbers for ad network integrations.

**Selective Data Export** allows filtering of events, properties, and user attributes to minimize data exposure.

**Regional Data Centers** support for platforms with geographic data residency requirements (EU, APAC regions).

**Anonymous User Handling** with configurable filtering to exclude users without proper identification.

### Integration Maintenance and Support

Destinations are categorized by maintenance model:

**Amplitude-Maintained** integrations receive direct support and updates from Amplitude's engineering team.

**Partner-Maintained** integrations are supported by the destination platform's team, with Amplitude providing the integration framework.

**Community/SDK-Based** integrations use Amplitude's plugin architecture for custom implementations.

The destination catalog represents Amplitude's commitment to data activation and customer journey orchestration, enabling businesses to leverage behavioral analytics insights across their entire technology stack for improved customer experiences and business outcomes.
