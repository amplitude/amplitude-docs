## Amplitude Destination Catalog

Amplitude's destination catalog represents a comprehensive ecosystem of integrations that enable businesses to activate their behavioral analytics data across marketing, customer engagement, experimentation, and data infrastructure platforms. The catalog encompasses over 100 destination integrations spanning multiple categories including event streaming, cohort syncing, data warehousing, and specialized use cases.

## Product Architecture and Integration Types

The destination catalog operates through several core integration patterns:

**Event Streaming Destinations** forward real-time user events and properties from Amplitude to external platforms using APIs like HTTP V2 API and Identify API. These integrations typically require authentication tokens, support event filtering, and handle user property mapping between platforms.

**Cohort Sync Destinations** export Amplitude's behavioral cohorts to marketing automation, experimentation, and customer engagement platforms. These integrations enable audience targeting, personalized campaigns, and A/B testing based on user behavior patterns analyzed in Amplitude.

**Data Warehouse Destinations** provide recurring data exports to cloud storage and analytics platforms including Amazon S3, Google BigQuery, Snowflake, and Azure Blob Storage. These support historical data backfills, hourly sync cadences, and structured schemas for event tables and merged user data.

**Raw Events Integration** enables bidirectional data flow and ETL processes through platforms like Fivetran, supporting automated data pipeline creation with configurable sync frequencies.

## Key Technical Components

**Authentication Methods** vary by destination type, including API keys, OAuth tokens, service account credentials, bearer tokens, and platform-specific authentication like Facebook Business Manager permissions or Google Cloud service accounts.

**User Identification Mapping** requires matching user identifiers between Amplitude and destination platforms, commonly using user_id, email addresses, device identifiers (IDFA, GAID, Android ID), or platform-specific IDs like Braze External ID or AppsFlyer Customer User ID.

**Data Transformation and Filtering** capabilities include Apache FreeMarker templating for webhook payloads, event property filtering, user property selection, and custom field mapping to destination platform schemas.

**Sync Cadences** range from real-time streaming to scheduled intervals (hourly, daily) with options for one-time exports, recurring syncs, and manual backfill operations for historical data.

## Platform Categories and Use Cases

**Marketing Automation Platforms** (HubSpot, Marketo, Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Mailchimp, Klaviyo) enable cohort-based email campaigns, lead scoring, and customer journey orchestration using behavioral segmentation from Amplitude.

**Customer Engagement Platforms** (Braze, Intercom, Customer.io, OneSignal, Pushwoosh) support personalized messaging across email, SMS, push notifications, and in-app channels based on user behavior patterns.

**Experimentation and Feature Management** (Optimizely, LaunchDarkly, Split, Statsig) leverage Amplitude cohorts for targeted A/B testing, feature flag rollouts, and conversion optimization experiments.

**Advertising Networks** (Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads, Snapchat Ads, TheTradeDesk) enable behavioral audience targeting, retargeting campaigns, and conversion tracking using Amplitude's user segmentation.

**Data Infrastructure** (Amazon Kinesis, Google Pub/Sub, Snowflake Data Share) provides real-time streaming and data pipeline integration for analytics workflows and downstream processing.

**Customer Success and Product Analytics** (Planhat, Productboard, Maze, Amplitude's own User Profile API) combine behavioral data with qualitative feedback for customer health scoring and product roadmap prioritization.

## Technical Implementation Patterns

**SDK Plugin Architecture** enables client-side integrations through DestinationPlugin implementations for platforms like FullStory, Hotjar, and Google Tag Manager, allowing event forwarding directly from Amplitude's browser SDK.

**Server-to-Server Integration** handles secure data transmission through REST APIs with authentication, rate limiting (commonly 2MB request limits), error handling (429 response codes), and retry mechanisms with exponential backoff.

**Batch Processing** supports cohort updates with JSON payloads containing cohort_name, cohort_id, in_cohort boolean flags, computed_time timestamps, message_id for deduplication, and user arrays with properties.

**Schema Standardization** maintains consistent data formats across destinations using Amplitude's Export API JSON format, with standardized fields like amplitude_id, event_properties, user_properties, and server_upload_time partitioning.

## Data Governance and Security

**IP Allowlisting** requirements for warehouse destinations ensure secure data transmission, while **IAM Role Configuration** for AWS services uses specific account ID 358203115967 with precise permission policies for services like Kinesis and S3.

**Encryption Standards** include SHA256 hashing for PII data in advertising platforms, secure token management for OAuth flows, and encrypted data transmission for sensitive customer information.

**Data Residency** considerations include regional endpoint configuration for platforms like CleverTap (supporting regions aps3, eu1, in1, sg1, mec1, us1) and compliance with data localization requirements.

The destination catalog represents Amplitude's comprehensive approach to data activation, enabling businesses to leverage behavioral analytics insights across their entire technology stack while maintaining security, scalability, and operational efficiency through standardized integration patterns and robust technical infrastructure.
