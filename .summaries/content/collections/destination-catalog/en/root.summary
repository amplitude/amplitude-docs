## Amplitude Destination Catalog

Amplitude's destination catalog represents a comprehensive ecosystem of integrations that enable businesses to activate their behavioral analytics data across marketing, customer engagement, experimentation, and data infrastructure platforms. The catalog encompasses over 100 destination integrations spanning multiple categories including event streaming, cohort syncing, data warehousing, and specialized use cases.

## Product Architecture and Integration Types

The destination catalog operates through several core integration patterns:

**Event Streaming Destinations** forward real-time event data and user properties from Amplitude to external platforms using APIs like HTTP V2 API and Identify API. These integrations typically require authentication tokens, support event filtering, and handle user property mapping between platforms.

**Cohort Sync Destinations** export behavioral audience segments from Amplitude to marketing and engagement platforms. These integrations use Amplitude's Behavioral Cohorts API and support various sync cadences (real-time, hourly, daily, scheduled) with user identifier matching across platforms.

**Data Warehouse Destinations** enable bulk export of raw events and merged user data to cloud storage and analytics platforms like Amazon S3, Google BigQuery, Snowflake, and Azure Blob Storage. These integrations support historical backfills, recurring syncs, and structured data schemas.

**Specialized API Integrations** include webhook destinations with Apache FreeMarker templating, User Profile API connections, and platform-specific implementations using SDK plugins.

## Key Technical Components

**Authentication Methods** vary by destination type, including API keys, OAuth tokens, service account credentials, bearer tokens, and platform-specific authentication like Facebook Business Manager permissions or Google Cloud Service Account keys.

**User Identification Mapping** is critical across integrations, supporting various identifier types including user_id, email addresses, device identifiers (IDFA, AAID, Android ID), platform-specific IDs (AppsFlyer ID, Braze External ID), and hashed identifiers with SHA256 encryption requirements.

**Data Transformation and Filtering** capabilities include event property filtering, user property selection, custom payload templating using Apache FreeMarker, and platform-specific data format requirements.

**Sync Mechanisms** support multiple cadences from real-time streaming to scheduled batch exports, with retry mechanisms, rate limiting handling, and delivery metrics tracking.

## Platform Categories and Use Cases

**Marketing Automation Platforms** (HubSpot, Marketo, Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Mailchimp, Klaviyo) enable cohort-based email campaigns, lead scoring, and customer journey automation.

**Customer Engagement Platforms** (Braze, Iterable, Customer.io, OneSignal, Pushwoosh) support multi-channel messaging across push notifications, SMS, email, and in-app messaging.

**Advertising Networks** (Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads, Snapchat Ads, Twitter Ads) enable audience targeting and conversion tracking with device ID and email matching.

**Experimentation Platforms** (Optimizely, LaunchDarkly, Split, Statsig) use cohorts for feature flag targeting and A/B test segmentation.

**Customer Success and Product Platforms** (Intercom, Planhat, Productboard, Appcues, CommandBar) leverage behavioral data for onboarding, support, and product adoption workflows.

**Data Infrastructure** (Amazon Kinesis, Google Pub/Sub, Fivetran, Segment) enables data pipeline integration and cross-platform analytics.

## Technical Implementation Patterns

**SDK Plugin Architecture** is used for browser-based integrations (FullStory, Hotjar, Google Tag Manager) with TypeScript DestinationPlugin implementations that forward events to third-party tracking codes.

**Webhook Destinations** support custom endpoint integration with configurable headers, Apache FreeMarker payload templating, and retry mechanisms with exponential backoff over 4-hour windows.

**Cloud Storage Integrations** use IAM roles and service accounts with specific permissions (kinesis:PutRecord, storage.objects.create, firehose:PutRecordBatch) and support JSON.gz file formats with timestamp-based partitioning.

**API Rate Limiting and Error Handling** includes 429 response handling, 2MB request size limits, retry policies, and platform-specific constraints like HubSpot's 50 custom properties limit or TikTok's 24 API calls per day.

## Data Schema and Export Formats

**Event Data Exports** typically include amplitude_id, user_id, event_name, event_properties, user_properties, server_upload_time, and client_event_time fields with JSON schema formatting.

**Cohort Exports** contain cohort_name, cohort_id, in_cohort boolean flags, computed_time timestamps, message_id for deduplication, and users arrays with user_properties.

**User Profile Data** includes merged Amplitude IDs, user properties, computed user properties, cohort memberships, and recommendation data for personalization use cases.

The destination catalog represents Amplitude's comprehensive approach to data activation, enabling businesses to leverage behavioral analytics across their entire technology stack through standardized integration patterns, robust authentication mechanisms, and flexible data transformation capabilities.
