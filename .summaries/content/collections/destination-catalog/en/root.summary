## Amplitude Destination Catalog

Amplitude's destination catalog represents a comprehensive ecosystem of integrations that enable businesses to activate their behavioral analytics data across marketing, customer engagement, experimentation, and data infrastructure platforms. The catalog encompasses over 100 destinations spanning cohort syncing, event streaming, and data warehousing capabilities.

## Core Integration Types and Architecture

The destination catalog operates through three primary integration patterns:

**Cohort Syncing Destinations** enable businesses to export user segments built in Amplitude to external platforms for targeted campaigns. These integrations sync behavioral cohorts to marketing automation platforms (Braze, Klaviyo, Mailchimp), advertising networks (Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads), and customer engagement tools (Intercom, OneSignal, Airship). Cohort syncs support various cadences including real-time, hourly, daily, and scheduled intervals.

**Event Streaming Destinations** provide real-time forwarding of Amplitude events and user properties to downstream systems. These integrations use Amplitude's HTTP V2 API and Identify API to stream behavioral data to platforms like Customer.io, HubSpot, Salesforce Marketing Cloud, and experimentation tools like Statsig and LaunchDarkly. Event streaming supports selective filtering, property mapping, and user identification across platforms.

**Data Warehouse and Storage Destinations** facilitate bulk export of raw events and merged user data to cloud storage and analytics platforms including Amazon S3, Google BigQuery, Snowflake, Azure Blob Storage, and Amazon Redshift. These integrations support hourly recurring syncs, historical backfills, and structured schemas for downstream analytics.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Concepts

**Amplitude ID (amplitude_id)** serves as the primary user identifier across destinations, with merged_amplitude_id handling user identity resolution. **User Properties** and **Event Properties** represent the core data structures transmitted to destinations, often requiring field mapping between Amplitude's schema and destination-specific formats.

**Cohort Membership** is tracked through boolean flags (in_cohort) and computed_time timestamps, enabling destinations to understand user segment entry/exit patterns. **Sync Cadences** define the frequency of data transmission, ranging from real-time streaming to scheduled batch exports.

**Authentication Mechanisms** vary by destination but commonly include API keys, OAuth tokens, service account credentials, and webhook authentication. Many integrations require specific permissions and role configurations on destination platforms.

## Platform Ecosystem Integration

The destination catalog integrates with distinct platform categories:

**Marketing Automation Platforms** (Braze, Customer.io, Klaviyo, Mailchimp, Salesforce Marketing Cloud) receive cohorts and events for triggered campaigns, personalization, and lifecycle marketing workflows.

**Advertising Networks** (Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads, LinkedIn Ads, Snapchat Ads) consume cohorts for audience targeting, lookalike modeling, and conversion tracking with support for device identifiers (IDFA, GAID) and hashed PII.

**Customer Engagement Tools** (Intercom, Zendesk, OneSignal, Airship) leverage behavioral data for in-app messaging, push notifications, and support workflows.

**Experimentation Platforms** (Optimizely, LaunchDarkly, Split, Statsig) use cohorts for feature flag targeting and A/B test segmentation.

**Data Infrastructure** (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, S3) receives structured event data for advanced analytics, machine learning, and business intelligence workflows.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

Destinations utilize various API patterns including:

- **REST APIs** for cohort syncing with endpoints like `/api/v1/cohorts` and batch user operations
- **Streaming APIs** for real-time event forwarding using HTTP POST to destination-specific ingestion endpoints  
- **Webhook Destinations** supporting custom payload transformation using Apache FreeMarker templating
- **Cloud Storage APIs** for bulk data export with IAM role-based authentication and bucket policies

**Rate Limiting and Error Handling** are implemented across destinations with exponential backoff retry mechanisms, 429 throttling responses, and delivery metrics tracking. Request size limits typically range from 2MB to 4.25MB depending on the destination.

## Data Transformation and Mapping

The catalog supports extensive **Field Mapping** capabilities, allowing transformation of Amplitude user properties to destination-specific schemas. **Property Filtering** enables selective transmission of events and user attributes based on business requirements.

**Identity Resolution** handles mapping between Amplitude's user identification system and destination-specific identifiers including email addresses, device IDs, customer IDs, and platform-specific user tokens. Many destinations require specific identifier formats and hashing (SHA256) for PII protection.

**Payload Customization** through templating engines allows businesses to transform Amplitude's standard event schema into destination-specific formats while maintaining data integrity and compliance requirements.

The destination catalog represents Amplitude's comprehensive approach to data activation, enabling businesses to leverage behavioral analytics across their entire technology stack through standardized integration patterns, robust authentication mechanisms, and flexible data transformation capabilities.
