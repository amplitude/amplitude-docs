Amplitude's Destination Catalog is a comprehensive ecosystem of integrations that enables businesses to sync behavioral cohorts, stream events, and export data from Amplitude's analytics platform to over 100 third-party marketing, analytics, and customer engagement platforms. The catalog serves as the central hub for activating Amplitude's behavioral insights across the entire marketing and product technology stack.

## Product Overview and Key Features

The destination catalog supports three primary integration types:

**Cohort Syncing** enables businesses to export user segments built in Amplitude to marketing automation platforms, advertising networks, and customer engagement tools for targeted campaigns. These integrations sync behavioral cohorts to platforms like Facebook Ads, Google Ads, Braze, HubSpot, and Mailchimp for audience targeting and personalized messaging.

**Event Streaming** provides real-time forwarding of Amplitude events and user properties to downstream systems using various APIs and webhooks. This enables platforms like Customer.io, Intercom, and Salesforce Marketing Cloud to trigger campaigns based on user behavior captured in Amplitude.

**Data Export** facilitates bulk data transfers to data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift), cloud storage (Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage), and ETL platforms (Fivetran) for advanced analytics and data science workflows.

## Integration Architecture and Relationships

The destination catalog operates through Amplitude's core platform components:

**Amplitude Activation** serves as the primary interface for configuring real-time cohort syncing and event streaming integrations, supporting both scheduled and real-time sync cadences with delivery metrics and monitoring capabilities.

**Amplitude Data** handles bulk data exports and warehouse destinations, providing recurring sync capabilities, historical backfills, and data integrity checks for enterprise data workflows.

**SDK Plugin Architecture** enables client-side integrations through DestinationPlugin implementations for platforms like Google Tag Manager, Hotjar, and FullStory, allowing event forwarding directly from browser and mobile SDKs.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Cohort Sync Cadence** refers to the frequency of audience updates, supporting one-time, scheduled (hourly/daily), and real-time synchronization depending on the destination platform's capabilities.

**User ID Mapping** is the critical configuration that matches Amplitude's user identification (user_id, amplitude_id, device_id) with destination platform identifiers (email, external_id, customer_id) to ensure proper user matching across systems.

**Event Filtering** allows selective forwarding of specific events and properties to destinations, reducing data volume and ensuring only relevant behavioral signals reach downstream platforms.

**Authentication Methods** vary by platform, including API keys, OAuth tokens, service account credentials, and webhook authentication, with many integrations requiring specific permission scopes and access levels.

## Ecosystem Integration Patterns

The destination catalog follows several key integration patterns:

**Marketing Automation Flow**: Behavioral cohorts from Amplitude sync to email platforms (Mailchimp, SendGrid), marketing automation tools (HubSpot, Marketo), and customer engagement platforms (Braze, Customer.io) for lifecycle marketing campaigns.

**Advertising Attribution Chain**: Event streaming to attribution platforms (AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch) combined with cohort syncing to ad networks (Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads) enables closed-loop attribution and audience optimization.

**Product Experience Orchestration**: Cohort syncing to in-app messaging platforms (Appcues, CommandBar, Userflow) and product adoption tools (Pendo, Chameleon) enables personalized onboarding and feature adoption campaigns.

**Data Warehouse Integration**: Raw events and merged user data export to cloud warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift) supports advanced analytics, machine learning model training, and cross-platform data science workflows.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

Key technical endpoints include:

- **Cohort Sync APIs**: Most destinations use REST APIs with JSON payloads containing cohort_name, cohort_id, in_cohort boolean flags, computed_time timestamps, and user arrays with properties
- **Event Streaming APIs**: Real-time event forwarding through HTTP APIs, with common patterns including user identification, event properties mapping, and rate limiting (typically 2MB request limits)
- **Webhook Destinations**: Custom webhook endpoints supporting Apache FreeMarker templating for payload customization and configurable retry mechanisms
- **Cloud Storage APIs**: Bulk export APIs for S3, GCS, and Azure Blob Storage with IAM role-based authentication and hourly partitioned file delivery

The destination catalog represents Amplitude's strategy to become the central behavioral data hub, enabling businesses to activate user insights across their entire technology stack while maintaining data consistency and user privacy compliance through standardized authentication and mapping protocols.
