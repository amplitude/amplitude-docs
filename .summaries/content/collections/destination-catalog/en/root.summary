Amplitude's Destination Catalog provides a comprehensive ecosystem of integrations that enable businesses to sync behavioral cohorts and stream event data from Amplitude to over 100 downstream platforms across marketing automation, advertising, analytics, customer engagement, and data infrastructure categories.

## Product Overview and Core Capabilities

The destination catalog serves as Amplitude's Customer Data Platform (CDP) hub, facilitating two primary data export patterns: **cohort syncing** and **event streaming**. Cohort syncing enables businesses to export user segments based on behavioral analytics to marketing and engagement platforms for targeted campaigns. Event streaming provides real-time forwarding of user interactions and properties to downstream systems for immediate activation and personalization.

The platform supports multiple authentication methods including OAuth, API keys, service accounts, and bearer tokens, with comprehensive user identifier mapping capabilities across email addresses, device IDs (IDFA, AAID, GAID), custom user IDs, and platform-specific identifiers. Data export formats include JSON, CSV, and platform-specific schemas with configurable sync cadences ranging from real-time to scheduled intervals.

## Integration Architecture and Data Flow

### Cohort Synchronization Framework
Amplitude's cohort syncing infrastructure enables behavioral audience export to marketing automation platforms (HubSpot, Marketo, Salesforce Marketing Cloud), customer engagement tools (Braze, Intercom, Customer.io), and advertising networks (Google Ads, Facebook Ads, TikTok Ads). The system supports three-file sync structures for entering/exiting/existing users, with configurable routing keys and user property column mapping.

### Event Streaming Infrastructure  
The event streaming architecture forwards real-time user interactions to platforms like Google Analytics 4, Mixpanel, and custom webhooks using Apache FreeMarker templating for payload customization. The system supports both HTTP V2 API and Identify API integration patterns, with event filtering, property mapping, and user forwarding capabilities.

### Data Warehouse Destinations
Enterprise data warehouse integrations include Snowflake, Google BigQuery, Amazon Redshift, and Azure Blob Storage with recurring sync configurations, historical backfill capabilities, and automatic deduplication. These destinations support hourly partitioned exports with server_upload_time partitioning and amplitude_id-based deduplication functions.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Amplitude ID (amplitude_id)**: Primary user identifier for deduplication and user merging across sessions and devices, stored as BIGNUMERIC in BigQuery and similar formats in other warehouses.

**Cohort Sync Cadences**: Configurable export frequencies including Real-time (immediate updates), Hourly, Daily, and Custom scheduled intervals with platform-specific rate limiting considerations.

**User Property Mapping**: Field correspondence between Amplitude user properties and destination platform user attributes, supporting custom field creation and data type transformations.

**Event Streaming Destinations**: Real-time integrations that forward individual user interactions as they occur, supporting event filtering, property selection, and custom payload templating.

**Merged User IDs**: Deduplicated user records that consolidate multiple amplitude_ids into unified user profiles for accurate cross-device and cross-session analytics.

**Device Identifier Mapping**: Support for mobile advertising IDs including iOS IDFA, Android AAID/GAID, with automatic SHA256 hashing for privacy compliance in advertising platforms.

## Ecosystem Integration Patterns

### Marketing Automation Ecosystem
The platform integrates with comprehensive marketing automation suites including HubSpot (Enterprise subscription required), Marketo (static lists and custom Boolean fields), Salesforce Marketing Cloud (v1 and v2 with automatic data extension creation), and Customer.io (tracking API and messaging platform integration). These integrations enable behavioral trigger campaigns, lifecycle marketing, and personalized customer journeys based on product usage analytics.

### Advertising and Attribution Networks
Advertising integrations span major platforms including Google Ads (cohort sync and conversion streaming), Facebook/Meta Pixel (Conversions API), TikTok Ads (Events API with SHA256 encryption), Twitter Ads, LinkedIn Ads, and Snapchat Ads. These destinations support custom audience creation, conversion tracking, and attribution analysis with platform-specific identifier requirements and rate limiting.

### Customer Engagement and Product Experience
Product experience platforms include Amplitude Activation integrations with Braze (bidirectional streaming), Intercom (event streaming and cohort sync), OneSignal (multi-channel messaging), and specialized tools like Appcues (in-app onboarding), CommandBar (AI-powered user assistance), and Userflow (no-code product tours).

### Analytics and Experimentation Platforms
Analytics destinations include Google Analytics 4 (web and mobile), Mixpanel, and experimentation platforms like Optimizely, Split, LaunchDarkly, and Statsig for feature flag targeting and A/B test audience creation based on behavioral cohorts.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

### Cohort Webhooks API
```
POST /webhook-endpoint
Content-Type: application/json
```
Payload structure includes `cohort_id`, `cohort_name`, `in_cohort` boolean, `computed_time` timestamp, `message_id` for deduplication, and `users` array with user properties.

### Event Streaming APIs
Major platforms utilize specific API endpoints:
- **Google Analytics 4**: Measurement Protocol API with Firebase App ID and API Secret
- **HubSpot**: Custom Events API with 50 property limit and p95 latency target of 60 seconds  
- **Braze**: HTTP V2 API and Identify API with External ID, Braze ID, User Alias, and Email mapping
- **Meta Pixel**: Conversions API with Customer Information Parameters and Custom Data Parameters

### Data Warehouse Export Schemas
**Snowflake Integration**: Supports VARIANT data types for JSON fields, requires IP allowlisting, and provides micro-batch file exports with ORGNAME-ACCOUNTNAME format authentication.

**BigQuery Integration**: Utilizes service account JSON keys with BigQuery Transfer service, automatic daily integrity checks, table partitioning by event_time, and ROW_NUMBER() OVER PARTITION deduplication functions.

**Amazon S3**: Implements IAM role-based authentication with specific bucket policies, supports KMS encryption migration, and provides projectID_yyyy-MM-dd_H#partitionInteger.json.gz file naming conventions.

The destination catalog represents Amplitude's comprehensive approach to customer data activation, enabling businesses to leverage behavioral analytics across their entire marketing and product technology stack through standardized integration patterns, robust authentication mechanisms, and flexible data export capabilities.
