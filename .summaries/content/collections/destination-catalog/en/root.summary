Amplitude's Destination Catalog represents a comprehensive ecosystem of data integration capabilities that enables businesses to activate their behavioral analytics data across 100+ marketing, experimentation, and customer engagement platforms. The catalog serves as the central hub for configuring data flows from Amplitude's analytics platform to downstream tools and services.

## Product Overview and Core Capabilities

The destination catalog encompasses four primary integration types:

**Event Streaming Destinations** forward real-time user events and properties from Amplitude to external platforms, enabling immediate activation of behavioral data for personalization, attribution, and engagement campaigns. These integrations typically require API keys, user ID mapping, and support filtering of events and properties.

**Cohort Sync Destinations** export Amplitude's behavioral cohorts (user segments) to marketing automation, experimentation, and customer engagement platforms. These integrations enable audience targeting, A/B testing, and personalized campaign delivery based on user behavior patterns analyzed in Amplitude.

**Raw Events/Warehouse Destinations** provide bulk data export capabilities to cloud data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift) and storage systems (S3, GCS, Azure Blob), supporting analytics workflows, data science initiatives, and compliance requirements with scheduled exports and historical backfills.

**Specialized API Integrations** include webhook destinations with Apache FreeMarker templating, User Profile API connections, and bidirectional sync capabilities that combine data ingestion with export functionality.

## Integration Architecture and Relationships

The destination catalog operates within Amplitude's broader data activation framework, connecting three core product areas:

**Amplitude Analytics** provides the source behavioral data, user properties, and computed metrics that feed into destination integrations. The platform's event tracking, user identification, and segmentation capabilities form the foundation for all downstream activations.

**Amplitude Activation** serves as the orchestration layer, managing real-time data flows, user identity resolution, and sync cadences across destinations. This includes features like Identify API forwarding, HTTP V2 API integration, and delivery metrics tracking.

**Amplitude Data** handles bulk export operations, warehouse integrations, and compliance-focused data delivery with features like manual backfills, deduplication, and integrity checking.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Concepts

**User Identification and Mapping**: Most destinations require mapping between Amplitude's user identification system (amplitude_id, user_id, anonymous_id) and the target platform's user identifiers. Common mapping patterns include email addresses, external IDs, device identifiers (IDFA, GAID), and platform-specific user tokens.

**Cohort Sync Mechanics**: Behavioral cohorts represent dynamic user segments based on event patterns and properties. Sync operations typically include three file types: entering users (new cohort members), exiting users (removed members), and existing users (current membership), with configurable sync cadences from real-time to daily.

**Event Streaming Protocols**: Real-time integrations use various authentication methods including API keys, OAuth tokens, bearer authentication, and service account credentials. Most streaming destinations support event filtering, property selection, and have size limits (commonly 2MB request limits).

**Data Export Formats**: Warehouse destinations typically export data in JSON format with specific schemas including amplitude_id, event_properties (SUPER/VARIANT data types), user_properties, and timestamp fields. Files are partitioned by server_upload_time and follow naming conventions like projectID_yyyy-MM-dd_H#partitionInteger.json.gz.

## Ecosystem Integration Patterns

The destination catalog supports several key integration patterns:

**Marketing Automation Workflows** connect Amplitude cohorts to platforms like HubSpot, Marketo, Salesforce Marketing Cloud, and Braze for triggered campaigns, lead scoring, and customer journey orchestration based on behavioral data.

**Advertising and Attribution Networks** including Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads, and Snapchat enable audience targeting and conversion tracking with support for hashed identifiers (SHA256), device IDs, and custom audience creation.

**Customer Engagement Platforms** such as Intercom, Customer.io, OneSignal, and Airship receive both cohort data and real-time events to power personalized messaging across email, push notifications, SMS, and in-app channels.

**Experimentation and Feature Management** tools like Optimizely, LaunchDarkly, Split, and Statsig use Amplitude cohorts for experiment targeting and feature flag conditions, enabling behavior-based testing strategies.

**Product Experience Platforms** including Appcues, CommandBar, Userflow, and Chameleon leverage cohort data for personalized onboarding flows, in-app guidance, and feature adoption campaigns.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

Key API patterns across destinations include:

**Authentication Endpoints**: Most integrations require API key generation from destination platforms, with common patterns including REST API keys, OAuth token exchange, and service account JSON credentials.

**Webhook Configurations**: Custom webhook destinations support Apache FreeMarker templating with variables like ${cohort_name}, ${user_properties}, ${in_cohort}, and ${computed_time} for payload customization.

**Rate Limiting and Error Handling**: Destinations implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff, 429 response handling, and delivery metrics tracking. Common limits include 2MB request sizes and platform-specific rate restrictions.

**Data Validation Requirements**: Many advertising platforms require specific data formats like E.164 phone numbers, ISO 4217 currency codes, and SHA256 hashing for PII fields.

The destination catalog represents Amplitude's commitment to data activation, enabling businesses to operationalize their behavioral analytics across their entire technology stack while maintaining data governance, user privacy, and integration reliability standards.
