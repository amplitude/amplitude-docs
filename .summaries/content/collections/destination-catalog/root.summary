## Amplitude Destination Catalog: Customer Data Platform Integration Hub

Amplitude's Destination Catalog functions as a comprehensive Customer Data Platform (CDP) that enables businesses to activate behavioral analytics across their entire technology stack. The platform facilitates data export to over 100 downstream integrations spanning marketing automation, advertising networks, customer engagement platforms, analytics tools, and enterprise data warehouses through two primary mechanisms: **cohort syncing** for audience segmentation and **event streaming** for real-time behavioral data forwarding.

## Core Product Architecture and Data Flow Patterns

### Cohort Synchronization Framework
The cohort sync infrastructure exports behavioral user segments to marketing and engagement platforms using configurable cadences (real-time, hourly, daily, custom intervals). The system implements a three-file sync structure tracking entering, exiting, and existing users within cohorts, with support for routing keys and comprehensive user property column mapping. Primary destinations include marketing automation platforms (HubSpot, Marketo, Salesforce Marketing Cloud), customer engagement tools (Braze, Intercom, Customer.io), and advertising networks (Google Ads, Facebook Ads, TikTok Ads).

### Event Streaming Infrastructure
Real-time event streaming forwards individual user interactions as they occur to downstream platforms including Google Analytics 4, Mixpanel, and custom webhook endpoints. The architecture utilizes Apache FreeMarker templating for payload customization and supports both HTTP V2 API and Identify API integration patterns with comprehensive event filtering, property mapping, and user forwarding capabilities.

### Enterprise Data Warehouse Destinations
Data warehouse integrations encompass Snowflake, Google BigQuery, Amazon Redshift, and Azure Blob Storage with recurring sync configurations, historical backfill capabilities, and automatic deduplication mechanisms. These destinations implement hourly partitioned exports with server_upload_time partitioning and amplitude_id-based deduplication functions for enterprise-scale data operations.

## Key Technical Nomenclature and Definitions

**Amplitude ID (amplitude_id)**: Primary user identifier serving as the foundation for deduplication and user merging across sessions and devices, stored as BIGNUMERIC in BigQuery and equivalent formats across data warehouses.

**Cohort Sync Cadences**: Configurable export frequencies including Real-time (immediate updates), Hourly, Daily, and Custom scheduled intervals, with platform-specific rate limiting and processing considerations.

**User Property Mapping**: Field correspondence system between Amplitude user properties and destination platform user attributes, supporting custom field creation, data type transformations, and schema validation.

**Event Streaming Destinations**: Real-time integration endpoints that process individual user interactions with support for event filtering, property selection, custom payload templating, and immediate data activation.

**Merged User IDs**: Deduplicated user records consolidating multiple amplitude_ids into unified user profiles for accurate cross-device and cross-session behavioral analytics.

**Device Identifier Mapping**: Comprehensive support for mobile advertising identifiers including iOS IDFA, Android AAID/GAID, with automatic SHA256 hashing for privacy compliance across advertising platforms.

## Ecosystem Integration Categories and Platform Relationships

### Marketing Automation and CRM Integration Layer
The platform provides deep integrations with enterprise marketing automation suites including HubSpot (requiring Enterprise subscription for custom events), Marketo (supporting static lists and custom Boolean fields), Salesforce Marketing Cloud (v1 and v2 APIs with automatic data extension creation), and Customer.io (tracking API and messaging platform integration). These connections enable behavioral trigger campaigns, lifecycle marketing automation, and personalized customer journey orchestration based on product usage analytics.

### Advertising and Attribution Network Ecosystem
Advertising integrations span major platforms including Google Ads (cohort sync and conversion streaming), Facebook/Meta Pixel (Conversions API), TikTok Ads (Events API with SHA256 encryption), Twitter Ads, LinkedIn Ads, and Snapchat Ads. These destinations support custom audience creation, conversion event tracking, and attribution analysis with platform-specific identifier requirements, rate limiting considerations, and privacy compliance mechanisms.

### Customer Engagement and Product Experience Platforms
Product experience integrations include bidirectional streaming with Braze, comprehensive event streaming and cohort sync with Intercom, multi-channel messaging through OneSignal, and specialized product experience tools including Appcues (in-app onboarding), CommandBar (AI-powered user assistance), and Userflow (no-code product tours) for behavioral-driven user experience optimization.

### Analytics and Experimentation Platform Connections
Analytics destinations encompass Google Analytics 4 (web and mobile implementations), Mixpanel for behavioral analytics, and experimentation platforms including Optimizely, Split, LaunchDarkly, and Statsig for feature flag targeting and A/B test audience creation based on behavioral cohort membership and user properties.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation Patterns

### Cohort Webhooks API Structure
```
POST /webhook-endpoint
Content-Type: application/json
```
Standard payload includes `cohort_id`, `cohort_name`, `in_cohort` boolean status, `computed_time` timestamp, `message_id` for deduplication, and `users` array containing user properties and identifiers.

### Platform-Specific Event Streaming APIs
**Google Analytics 4**: Implements Measurement Protocol API requiring Firebase App ID and API Secret authentication with custom event parameter mapping.

**HubSpot Integration**: Utilizes Custom Events API with 50 property limit constraint and p95 latency target of 60 seconds for real-time behavioral data forwarding.

**Braze Integration**: Supports both HTTP V2 API and Identify API with flexible user identification through External ID, Braze ID, User Alias, and Email mapping options.

**Meta Pixel Integration**: Implements Conversions API with Customer Information Parameters and Custom Data Parameters for privacy-compliant conversion tracking.

### Data Warehouse Export Implementation Schemas

**Snowflake Integration**: Supports VARIANT data types for JSON field storage, requires IP allowlisting for security, implements micro-batch file exports with ORGNAME-ACCOUNTNAME authentication format.

**BigQuery Integration**: Utilizes service account JSON key authentication with BigQuery Transfer service, implements automatic daily integrity checks, table partitioning by event_time, and ROW_NUMBER() OVER PARTITION deduplication functions.

**Amazon S3 Integration**: Implements IAM role-based authentication with specific bucket policy requirements, supports KMS encryption migration, utilizes projectID_yyyy-MM-dd_H#partitionInteger.json.gz file naming conventions for organized data storage.

The Destination Catalog represents Amplitude's comprehensive approach to behavioral data activation, enabling businesses to leverage product analytics across their entire marketing and product technology ecosystem through standardized integration patterns, robust authentication mechanisms, and flexible data export capabilities that support both real-time activation and batch processing workflows.
