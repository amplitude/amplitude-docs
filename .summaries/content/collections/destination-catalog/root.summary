Amplitude's destination catalog is a comprehensive data activation platform that enables businesses to export behavioral analytics data to over 100 third-party integrations across marketing, customer engagement, experimentation, and data infrastructure platforms. The catalog serves as the bridge between Amplitude's behavioral analytics engine and external systems, facilitating real-time data streaming, audience segmentation, and cross-platform user engagement.

## Core Integration Architecture

The destination catalog operates through four primary integration patterns that define how data flows from Amplitude to external platforms:

**Event Streaming Destinations** provide real-time forwarding of behavioral events and user properties through APIs like HTTP V2 API and Identify API. These integrations maintain continuous data flow with event filtering capabilities and user property mapping between platforms.

**Cohort Sync Destinations** export behavioral audience segments using Amplitude's Behavioral Cohorts API, supporting multiple sync cadences including real-time, hourly, daily, and custom scheduled intervals. These integrations enable precise audience targeting across marketing and engagement platforms.

**Data Warehouse Destinations** facilitate bulk export of raw events and merged user data to cloud storage platforms including Amazon S3, Google BigQuery, Snowflake, and Azure Blob Storage. These integrations support historical backfills, recurring sync schedules, and structured data schemas for analytics workflows.

**Specialized API Integrations** encompass webhook destinations with Apache FreeMarker templating, User Profile API connections, and platform-specific SDK plugin implementations for browser-based tracking.

## Platform Ecosystem and Use Cases

The destination catalog spans multiple platform categories, each serving distinct business functions:

**Marketing Automation Platforms** including HubSpot, Marketo, Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Mailchimp, and Klaviyo enable cohort-driven email campaigns, lead scoring, and automated customer journey orchestration.

**Customer Engagement Platforms** such as Braze, Iterable, Customer.io, OneSignal, and Pushwoosh support multi-channel messaging across push notifications, SMS, email, and in-app communications.

**Advertising Networks** including Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads, Snapchat Ads, and Twitter Ads facilitate audience targeting and conversion tracking through device ID and email matching.

**Experimentation Platforms** like Optimizely, LaunchDarkly, Split, and Statsig leverage behavioral cohorts for feature flag targeting and A/B test segmentation.

**Customer Success Platforms** including Intercom, Planhat, Productboard, Appcues, and CommandBar utilize behavioral data for onboarding optimization, support workflows, and product adoption initiatives.

**Data Infrastructure** platforms such as Amazon Kinesis, Google Pub/Sub, Fivetran, and Segment enable data pipeline integration and cross-platform analytics consolidation.

## Technical Implementation Framework

**Authentication Architecture** varies by destination type, supporting API keys, OAuth tokens, service account credentials, bearer tokens, and platform-specific authentication mechanisms like Facebook Business Manager permissions or Google Cloud Service Account keys.

**User Identification Mapping** serves as the foundation for cross-platform data synchronization, supporting multiple identifier types including user_id, email addresses, device identifiers (IDFA, AAID, Android ID), platform-specific IDs (AppsFlyer ID, Braze External ID), and SHA256-hashed identifiers for privacy compliance.

**SDK Plugin Architecture** enables browser-based integrations through TypeScript DestinationPlugin implementations that forward events to third-party tracking codes, supporting platforms like FullStory, Hotjar, and Google Tag Manager.

**Webhook Destinations** provide custom endpoint integration with configurable headers, Apache FreeMarker payload templating, and retry mechanisms featuring exponential backoff over 4-hour windows.

## Data Transformation and Processing

**Event Data Exports** include standardized fields such as amplitude_id, user_id, event_name, event_properties, user_properties, server_upload_time, and client_event_time with JSON schema formatting.

**Cohort Export Schema** contains cohort_name, cohort_id, in_cohort boolean flags, computed_time timestamps, message_id for deduplication, and users arrays with associated user_properties.

**User Profile Data** encompasses merged Amplitude IDs, user properties, computed user properties, cohort memberships, and recommendation data for personalization workflows.

**Data Transformation Capabilities** include event property filtering, user property selection, custom payload templating using Apache FreeMarker, and platform-specific data format adaptation.

## Key Technical Nomenclature

**Behavioral Cohorts API** - Core API for exporting audience segments based on user behavior patterns
**HTTP V2 API** - Primary event streaming interface for real-time data forwarding
**Identify API** - User property synchronization endpoint for profile updates
**DestinationPlugin** - TypeScript interface for browser-based SDK integrations
**Apache FreeMarker** - Templating engine for custom webhook payload formatting
**Amplitude ID** - Unique user identifier for cross-session tracking and data merging

## Operational Constraints and Limitations

**API Rate Limiting** includes handling of 429 responses, 2MB request size limits, and platform-specific constraints such as HubSpot's 50 custom properties limit or TikTok's 24 API calls per day restriction.

**Cloud Storage Permissions** require specific IAM roles and service accounts with permissions like kinesis:PutRecord, storage.objects.create, and firehose:PutRecordBatch for data warehouse integrations.

**Sync Mechanisms** support multiple cadences with retry mechanisms, rate limiting handling, and delivery metrics tracking to ensure reliable data transmission across all destination types.

The destination catalog represents Amplitude's comprehensive data activation strategy, enabling businesses to operationalize behavioral analytics across their entire technology ecosystem through standardized integration patterns, robust authentication frameworks, and flexible data transformation capabilities.
