Amplitude's destination catalog is a comprehensive data activation platform that enables organizations to export behavioral analytics data to over 100 external platforms across marketing, customer engagement, experimentation, and business intelligence ecosystems. The catalog serves as the bridge between Amplitude's behavioral analytics insights and downstream activation platforms, facilitating data-driven customer experiences and business intelligence workflows.

## Core Integration Architecture

The destination catalog operates on three fundamental integration patterns that define how data flows from Amplitude to external platforms:

**Event Streaming Destinations** provide real-time forwarding of user events and properties through APIs like HTTP V2 and Identify API. These integrations maintain continuous data synchronization, requiring authentication tokens and supporting granular event filtering with user property mappings between platforms.

**Cohort Sync Destinations** export Amplitude's behavioral cohorts to enable audience targeting across marketing automation, experimentation, and customer engagement platforms. These integrations synchronize user segments based on behavioral criteria with flexible sync cadences including real-time, hourly, daily, and custom scheduled intervals.

**Data Warehouse Destinations** facilitate bulk export capabilities to cloud storage and analytics platforms, supporting recurring synchronization, historical backfills, and structured data schemas optimized for downstream analysis and business intelligence workflows.

## Platform Ecosystem Integration

The destination catalog spans multiple platform categories, each serving distinct use cases within the broader customer data activation ecosystem:

**Marketing Automation & Customer Engagement** platforms represent the largest category, encompassing integrations with Braze, Customer.io, HubSpot, Mailchimp, Klaviyo, and Salesforce Marketing Cloud. These destinations enable personalized campaign targeting through both event streaming and cohort synchronization capabilities.

**Advertising Networks** facilitate audience activation across major advertising platforms including Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads, LinkedIn Ads, Snapchat Ads, and Twitter Ads. These integrations focus primarily on cohort synchronization with platform-specific identifier requirements and custom audience creation for retargeting campaigns.

**Experimentation Platforms** including Optimizely, LaunchDarkly, Split, and Statsig enable behavior-based feature flag targeting and A/B testing using Amplitude cohorts, supporting sophisticated experimentation workflows driven by behavioral segmentation.

**Data Infrastructure** destinations encompass major cloud platforms (Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage), data warehouses (Snowflake, Google BigQuery, Amazon Redshift), and streaming platforms (Amazon Kinesis, Google Pub/Sub) for enterprise data pipeline integration.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Cohort Sync**: The process of exporting user segments from Amplitude to external platforms, typically involving JSON payloads containing cohort metadata (cohort_name, cohort_id, in_cohort boolean) and user arrays with identifiers and properties.

**Event Streaming**: Real-time forwarding of user behavioral events from Amplitude to destination platforms, including event properties, user properties, and custom attributes mapped to destination-specific schemas.

**User Identification Mapping**: The process of matching users between Amplitude and destination platforms using various identifier types including email addresses, device IDs (IDFA, GAID, Android ID), custom user IDs, and multiple identifier combinations.

**Computed_time**: Timestamp field included in cohort sync payloads indicating when the cohort membership was calculated, used for deduplication and sync tracking purposes.

**Message_id**: Unique identifier included in data payloads for deduplication and tracking of individual sync operations across destination platforms.

## Authentication and Configuration Framework

The destination catalog implements standardized authentication patterns across platform integrations:

**API Key Authentication** provides simple token-based access for platforms like Braze, Customer.io, and most marketing automation tools, requiring secure storage and rotation of authentication tokens.

**OAuth Authentication** enables secure delegated access for platforms like HubSpot, Facebook Ads, and Google services, supporting token refresh and scope-based permissions management.

**Service Account Authentication** facilitates enterprise-grade access for cloud platforms using JSON keys and IAM roles, enabling secure programmatic access to data warehouse and cloud storage destinations.

**Custom Authentication** accommodates platform-specific authentication methods, such as Salesforce Marketing Cloud's Client ID/Secret/Subdomain combination and other proprietary authentication schemes.

## Data Payload Architecture

Event streaming destinations support structured data payloads containing:
- Event properties with platform-specific field mapping and size limitations
- User properties for profile enrichment and behavioral segmentation
- Custom attributes mapped to destination-specific schemas
- Timestamp formatting and timezone handling for accurate event sequencing

Cohort sync destinations utilize standardized JSON payload structures featuring:
- Cohort metadata including cohort_name, cohort_id, and in_cohort boolean indicators
- User arrays containing user_properties and platform-specific identifiers
- Computed_time and message_id fields for deduplication and sync tracking
- Batch processing capabilities for efficient large-scale cohort updates

## Performance and Reliability Framework

The destination catalog implements comprehensive performance management including:

**Rate Limiting** with 429 response handling and exponential backoff strategies to respect destination platform API constraints and ensure reliable data delivery.

**Request Size Limits** typically capped at 2MB for event streaming destinations to optimize API performance and prevent timeout issues.

**Batch Processing** for cohort synchronization to optimize API usage and reduce the number of individual requests required for large-scale audience updates.

**Retry Mechanisms** with configurable attempt limits and timeout settings to ensure data delivery reliability in the face of temporary platform unavailability.

## Enterprise Data Warehouse Integration

Major cloud data warehouse destinations provide enterprise-grade capabilities including:

**Recurring Sync Schedules** with hourly, daily, or custom cadences to meet varying business requirements for data freshness and processing windows.

**Historical Data Backfill** capabilities enabling complete data migration and historical analysis for organizations transitioning to new data infrastructure.

**Schema Management** with predefined table structures optimized for events and user data, supporting consistent data organization across warehouse implementations.

**Deduplication Functions** for handling duplicate events during export processes, ensuring data quality and preventing analytical inaccuracies.

**Partitioning Strategies** by timestamp fields to optimize query performance and reduce costs in cloud data warehouse environments.

## Specialized Integration Categories

**Customer Success Platforms** including Planhat and Gainsight focus on user activity streaming for health scoring, churn prediction, and automated workflow triggers based on behavioral patterns.

**Product Analytics Enhancement** destinations like FullStory, Hotjar, and Mixpanel enable cross-platform behavioral analysis and comprehensive user journey mapping.

**Qualitative Feedback Integration** platforms including Maze, Qualtrics, and Refiner combine quantitative behavioral data with survey responses and user research for holistic customer understanding.

**Attribution & Mobile Marketing** destinations including AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch, and Kochava support mobile app attribution workflows, deep linking, and mobile-specific user acquisition analytics.

The destination catalog represents Amplitude's comprehensive approach to data activation, enabling organizations to leverage behavioral insights across their entire technology stack for personalized customer experiences, data-driven experimentation, and sophisticated business intelligence workflows.
