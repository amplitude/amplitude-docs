# Amplitude Destination Catalog: Comprehensive Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude's Destination Catalog is a comprehensive integration hub that enables businesses to activate their product analytics data across marketing, customer engagement, and business intelligence platforms. The catalog offers 100+ pre-built integrations that allow users to stream events, sync user cohorts, and export data to various third-party systems, creating a connected data ecosystem that powers personalized customer experiences and data-driven decision making.

The Destination Catalog serves as a critical component of Amplitude's Customer Data Platform (CDP), enabling businesses to not only collect and analyze behavioral data but also activate it across their tech stack without requiring extensive engineering resources or custom development work.

## Product Ecosystem and Architecture

The Destination Catalog is part of Amplitude's broader data platform that includes:

1. **Amplitude Analytics**: The core analytics platform where user behavior is analyzed and cohorts are created
2. **Amplitude CDP**: The customer data platform that manages user profiles and identities
3. **Amplitude Activation**: The orchestration layer that enables data to flow to destination systems

The typical data flow works as follows:
1. User behavior data is collected via Amplitude SDKs or imported from other sources
2. Data is processed, analyzed, and used to create insights and segments in Amplitude
3. Through the Destination Catalog, this data is then activated across the tech stack
4. Destination systems use this data for personalization, targeting, and business intelligence

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### User Identification Terms
- **User ID**: The primary identifier for users in Amplitude, often mapped to destination systems
- **Device ID**: Mobile advertising identifiers like IDFA (iOS) and GAID (Android)
- **External ID**: Third-party identifiers used for cross-platform matching
- **User Alias**: Alternative identifiers for the same user

### Integration Types
- **Event Stream**: Real-time forwarding of event data to destinations
- **Cohort Sync**: Exporting user segments based on behavioral criteria
- **Data Export**: Scheduled or one-time exports of raw event data

### Authentication Methods
- **API Key**: Simple key-based authentication for many destinations
- **OAuth**: Token-based authentication with refresh capabilities
- **IAM Role**: AWS Identity and Access Management for AWS services
- **Service Account**: Google Cloud authentication method

### Sync Cadences
- **Real-time**: Immediate updates as events occur or users enter/exit cohorts
- **Hourly/Daily**: Scheduled syncs at regular intervals
- **One-time**: Manual export of data or cohorts
