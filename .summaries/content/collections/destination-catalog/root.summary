# Amplitude Destination Catalog

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude's Destination Catalog is an integration hub that connects Amplitude analytics data with third-party platforms. It enables organizations to activate their product analytics data through three primary integration types:

1. **Event Streaming** - Real-time forwarding of Amplitude events to destination platforms
2. **Cohort Syncing** - Exporting behavioral user segments to target platforms
3. **Data Export** - Transferring raw event data and user information to data warehouses and storage solutions

These integrations create a unified data ecosystem where Amplitude's behavioral insights can trigger actions across a company's tech stack, from personalized marketing campaigns to targeted product experiences.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Cohort**: A group of users defined by specific behaviors or characteristics
- **Event Streaming**: Real-time forwarding of user events to destination platforms
- **Identify Forwarding**: Sending user profile updates when properties change
- **User Property**: Attributes associated with users that can be mapped to destinations
- **Event Property**: Attributes associated with events that can be mapped to destinations
- **Sync Cadence**: Frequency of cohort membership updates to destinations
- **API Key/Secret**: Authentication credentials for destination connections
- **User ID Mapping**: Matching user identifiers between Amplitude and destinations
- **Backfill**: Exporting historical data to a destination platform
- **Webhook**: Custom HTTP endpoint receiving event and user data from Amplitude

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Destination Catalog is part of Amplitude's broader ecosystem:

- **Amplitude Analytics**: Core platform collecting and analyzing user behavior data
- **Amplitude Data**: Data management layer processing data for activation
- **Amplitude Activation**: Component enabling action on insights through integrations
- **Amplitude CDP**: Unified profile system connecting user data across touchpoints

The Destination Catalog sits within Amplitude Activation, bridging behavioral insights and action. It closes the loop between understanding user behavior and taking targeted actions to improve engagement, conversion, and retention.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

Key API endpoints include:
- **Cohort API**: `https://amplitude.com/api/2/cohorts`
- **Export API**: `https://amplitude.com/api/2/export`
