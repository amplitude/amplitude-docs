# Amplitude Destination Catalog

## Overview

Amplitude's Destination Catalog is an integration hub that enables businesses to activate their product analytics data across marketing, customer engagement, and data platforms. The catalog offers two primary integration types:

1. **Event Streaming Destinations**: Real-time forwarding of Amplitude events and user data to third-party platforms
2. **Cohort Sync Destinations**: Exporting user segments (cohorts) created in Amplitude to other platforms for targeted actions

These integrations allow organizations to leverage behavioral analytics data for personalized marketing campaigns, targeted messaging, feature experimentation, data warehousing, and customer experience optimization without extensive engineering resources.

## Key Features

### Event Streaming Capabilities
- Real-time event and user property forwarding
- Configurable event filtering
- User property mapping across platforms
- Client-side and server-side integration support
- Identify forwarding for user profile updates

### Cohort Syncing Capabilities
- Behavioral segment export to marketing and engagement platforms
- Configurable sync cadences (one-time, scheduled, real-time)
- Support for entering/exiting/existing cohort members
- User property inclusion with cohort data
- Multiple identifier mapping options (email, user_id, device IDs)

### Authentication Methods
- API key authentication
- OAuth authentication
- Service account credentials
- IAM role-based access
- Client ID/Secret pairs

### Data Delivery Mechanisms
- Direct API integrations
- Webhook delivery
- Cloud storage exports (S3, GCS, Azure Blob)
- Data warehouse connections (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift)
- Pub/Sub messaging

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### User Identification Terms
- **User ID**: Primary identifier in Amplitude, mapped to external systems
- **Device ID**: Mobile advertising identifiers (IDFA, AAID) or browser fingerprints
- **External ID**: Third-party system identifiers for cross-platform matching
- **Amplitude ID**: Internal identifier for merged user tracking

### Cohort-Related Terms
- **Cohort**: User segment defined by behavioral criteria in Amplitude
- **Sync Cadence**: Frequency of cohort data updates (one-time, hourly, daily, real-time)
- **Entering/Exiting/Existing**: User status relative to cohort membership
- **User Properties**: Additional attributes sent with cohort data

### Authentication Terms
- **API Key**: Secret token for destination platform authentication
- **OAuth**: Protocol for secure delegated access
- **Service Account**: Identity with specific permissions for server-to-server authentication
- **IAM Role**: AWS Identity and Access Management role for secure access

### Technical Terms
- **Webhook**: HTTP callback for real-time data delivery
- **FreeMarker**: Templating language for customizing webhook payloads
- **Event Filtering**: Rules determining which events are forwarded
- **Property Mapping**: Configuration aligning data fields between platforms

## Integration with Amplitude Ecosystem

The Destination Catalog works with other Amplitude products:

1. **Amplitude Analytics**: Provides behavioral data and cohort definitions
2. **Amplitude CDP**: Manages user profiles and identity resolution
3. **Amplitude Experiment**: Works with feature flag destinations for experimentation
4. **Amplitude Data**: Provides data collection and processing infrastructure

Typical workflow:
1. Data collection via Amplitude SDKs or server-side implementations
2. Analytics and insight generation in Amplitude
3. Cohort creation based on user behavior or properties
4. Destination configuration to receive events and/or cohorts
5. Data activation across marketing, product, and data platforms

## API and Implementation Details

### Common API Patterns
- Event streaming destinations use REST APIs with JSON payloads
- Cohort syncs use batch APIs with pagination for large cohorts
- Authentication via API keys or OAuth tokens
- Support for custom headers and payload formatting

### Implementation Considerations
- User identity mapping is critical for successful integration
- Rate limits vary by destination
- Data privacy and security settings should be reviewed
- Some destinations require paid plans on both Amplitude and target platforms

### Common Command Patterns
For webhook destinations, FreeMarker templates customize payloads:
```
{
  "userId": "${event.user_id}",
  "eventType": "${event.event_type}",
  "properties": {
    <#list event.event_properties as property, value>
      "${property}": "${value}"<#if property_has_next>,</#if>
    </#list>
  }
}
```
