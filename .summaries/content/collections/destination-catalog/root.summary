Amplitude's destination catalog is a comprehensive data activation ecosystem that enables businesses to export and synchronize behavioral analytics data across 100+ third-party platforms. The catalog serves as the bridge between Amplitude's analytics platform and downstream marketing, customer engagement, experimentation, and data infrastructure tools, facilitating data-driven customer experiences through three core integration patterns.

## Core Integration Architecture

The destination catalog operates through three primary data flow mechanisms:

**Cohort Syncing Destinations** export user segments from Amplitude to external platforms for audience targeting and personalization. These integrations focus on user identifier mapping (email, user_id, device IDs) and support flexible sync cadences including scheduled, one-time, and real-time synchronization.

**Event Streaming Destinations** provide real-time event forwarding from Amplitude to downstream platforms using HTTP V2 API, Identify API, and platform-specific endpoints. These integrations enable behavioral trigger automation, user profile enrichment, and cross-platform event synchronization with selective filtering capabilities.

**Raw Data Export Destinations** facilitate bulk data transfer to data warehouses and cloud storage platforms through recurring exports of event tables, merged user data, and cohort membership files. These integrations support analytics, machine learning, and business intelligence use cases with configurable export schedules and data partitioning.

## Platform Integration Categories

### Marketing Automation and Customer Engagement
The catalog includes extensive integrations with email marketing and customer engagement platforms including **Braze**, **Customer.io**, **Iterable**, **Klaviyo**, **Mailchimp**, and **SendGrid**. These destinations typically require API key authentication and support both cohort syncing for audience segmentation and event streaming for behavioral trigger campaigns.

**HubSpot** provides dual integration modes - cohort sync for CRM audience management and event streaming v2 for workflow automation. The integration requires HubSpot Enterprise subscriptions, supports up to 50 custom properties per event, and maintains p95 latency targets of 60 seconds for real-time data activation.

### Advertising and Attribution Networks
Ad network destinations including **Facebook Ads**, **Google Ads**, **TikTok Ads**, **Snapchat Ads**, and **Twitter Ads** enable audience creation and conversion tracking. These integrations require device identifier mapping (IDFA, GAID), SHA256 encryption for PII fields, and support multiple match types including email, phone numbers, and mobile advertising IDs.

**Google Ads** specifically provides cohort syncing for audience targeting and event streaming using the Upload Click Conversions API, requiring Google Click ID (gclid) parameters for proper attribution tracking and conversion measurement.

### Experimentation and Feature Management
Experimentation platforms like **Optimizely**, **LaunchDarkly**, **Split**, and **Statsig** enable behavioral cohort targeting for A/B testing and feature flag management. These integrations support user identifier mapping and workspace/environment configuration for targeted experiment execution.

### Data Infrastructure and Cloud Storage
Enterprise data destinations include **Amazon S3**, **Google Cloud Storage**, **Azure Blob Storage**, **Snowflake**, **Google BigQuery**, and **Amazon Redshift**. These integrations support:

- **Hourly recurring exports** with server_upload_time partitioning for real-time data pipeline feeding
- **Historical data backfills** for complete data migration and warehouse initialization  
- **Merged Amplitude ID exports** for cross-platform user identity resolution
- **Event table schemas** with JSON/SUPER data types for event_properties and user_properties storage
- **IAM role-based authentication** with granular permission requirements for secure data access

**Snowflake** provides both standard destination exports and **Snowflake Data Share** for native data sharing capabilities, with regional limitations (US West Oregon/AWS only) and specific table schemas including amplitude_id, event_properties, and merge_event_time fields.

### Product Analytics and Customer Success
Product-focused destinations like **Amplitude Activation**, **Appcues**, **CommandBar**, **Userflow**, and **Candu** enable in-app messaging, user onboarding flows, and contextual product tours based on behavioral cohort membership.

**Planhat** integration streams user activity data for customer health scoring and success workflow automation, requiring user_id to externalId matching and Tenant Token authentication for secure data transmission.

## Authentication and Configuration Framework

### Authentication Patterns
The catalog employs multiple authentication mechanisms:
- **REST API Keys** for platforms like Braze, Customer.io, Iterable with platform-specific key formats
- **Bearer Token authentication** for services like Aampe, Meta Pixel requiring OAuth-style tokens
- **OAuth authentication** for platforms like HubSpot and Google services requiring user consent flows

### User Identifier Mapping Strategy
Cross-platform data synchronization relies on robust identifier mapping:
- **Email addresses** for marketing automation platform user matching
- **Device identifiers** (IDFA, GAID, Android ID) for mobile attribution and advertising
- **Custom user IDs** for platform-specific user resolution
- **External IDs** for CRM and customer success platform integration

### Sync Cadence Configuration
Destinations support flexible synchronization frequencies:
- **Real-time syncing** for immediate data activation and personalization
- **Scheduled syncs** (hourly, daily) for batch processing and system optimization
- **One-time syncs** for initial data migration and setup
- **Manual backfills** for historical data export and analysis

## Data Transformation and Processing Capabilities

### Event and Property Filtering
Streaming destinations provide granular data control through:
- **Send Events filters** for selective event forwarding based on event types
- **Event Properties filters** for specific data field transmission control
- **User Properties filters** for profile synchronization and privacy management

### Payload Customization
Advanced destinations like **Webhooks** and **Cohort Webhooks** support **Apache FreeMarker templating** for custom payload formatting, enabling flexible data transformation, custom header configuration, and platform-specific data structure requirements.

### Technical Constraints and Limitations
The catalog operates within defined technical boundaries:
- **2MB request size limits** for most streaming destinations to ensure reliable transmission
- **429 rate limiting** with exponential backoff retry mechanisms for API protection
- **Platform-specific API limits** requiring enterprise subscriptions (e.g., HubSpot Enterprise requirements)

## Specialized Integration Features

### Cohort Webhook Architecture
Real-time cohort update destinations support configurable webhook templates with variables including cohort_id, cohort_name, in_cohort boolean status, computed_time timestamps, and message_id for deduplication and idempotency.

### SDK Plugin Integration
Client-side destinations like **FullStory**, **Hotjar**, and **Google Tag Manager** utilize Amplitude's DestinationPlugin architecture for browser-based event forwarding, enabling real-time user behavior tracking and cross-platform analytics.

### Multi-Platform Configuration
Enterprise destinations support separate configurations per platform (iOS/Android) and multiple identifier types for comprehensive cross-platform user matching and attribution tracking.

## Key API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

The destination catalog leverages several core API patterns:
- **HTTP V2 API** for real-time event streaming with JSON payload formatting
- **Identify API** for user profile updates and property synchronization
- **Cohort API** for audience export and synchronization management
- **Upload Click Conversions API** (Google Ads) for attribution and conversion tracking
- **Platform-specific REST APIs** for native integration capabilities

The Amplitude destination catalog represents a comprehensive data activation platform that transforms behavioral analytics into actionable customer experiences across the entire technology ecosystem, from real-time personalization engines to enterprise data warehouses and marketing automation platforms.
