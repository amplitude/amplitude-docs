## Amplitude Destination Catalog

Amplitude's destination catalog is a comprehensive data activation platform that enables organizations to export behavioral analytics data to over 100 external platforms across marketing, customer engagement, experimentation, and data infrastructure ecosystems. The catalog serves as the bridge between Amplitude's behavioral analytics insights and downstream activation platforms, supporting real-time event streaming, audience segmentation, and comprehensive data warehousing workflows.

## Product Architecture and Integration Patterns

The destination catalog operates through three distinct integration architectures that define how data flows from Amplitude to external platforms:

**Event Streaming Destinations** provide real-time forwarding of user events and properties through APIs like HTTP V2 and Identify API. These integrations maintain continuous data synchronization with external platforms, supporting event filtering, user property mapping, and configurable delivery mechanisms with authentication token management.

**Cohort Sync Destinations** enable behavioral audience segment export to marketing and engagement platforms. These integrations transform Amplitude's analytics-driven user segmentation into actionable targeting audiences across external platforms, supporting multiple sync cadences (real-time, hourly, daily, scheduled) and sophisticated user identifier mapping strategies.

**Raw Data Export Destinations** facilitate comprehensive data warehouse and cloud storage integrations for complete event datasets, merged user profiles, and historical data export. These integrations include advanced features like automatic backfills, data deduplication, schema management, and partitioning strategies for large-scale analytics data lakes.

## Platform Ecosystem and Use Cases

The destination catalog spans multiple platform categories that represent the modern customer engagement and data infrastructure stack:

**Marketing Automation & Customer Engagement** platforms including Braze, Customer.io, Klaviyo, HubSpot, Mailchimp, and Salesforce Marketing Cloud enable cohort-driven campaign targeting and real-time behavioral event triggering. These integrations support personalized messaging across email, SMS, push notifications, and in-app channels based on behavioral analytics insights.

**Advertising & Attribution Networks** such as Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads, LinkedIn Ads, and AppsFlyer support audience creation from behavioral cohorts with platform-specific identifier requirements including IDFA, GAID, and email hashing. These integrations enable conversion tracking through pixel integrations and server-to-server event forwarding for attribution analysis.

**Experimentation & Feature Management** platforms including Optimizely, LaunchDarkly, Split, and Statsig leverage Amplitude cohorts for experiment targeting and feature flag segmentation, creating behavior-based experimentation workflows that combine analytics insights with product testing strategies.

**Data Infrastructure & Warehousing** destinations encompass Amazon S3, Google BigQuery, Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, and cloud storage solutions with comprehensive schema management, automated sync processes, and partitioning strategies for analytics data lakes and business intelligence workflows.

**Customer Success & Product Analytics** integrations with platforms like Planhat, Productboard, and feedback collection tools enable combining quantitative behavioral data with qualitative insights for product development, customer health scoring, and user experience optimization.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Cohort Sync** refers to the process of exporting behavioral audience segments from Amplitude to external platforms, enabling targeting of specific user groups based on analytics-driven segmentation criteria.

**Event Streaming** describes real-time forwarding of individual user events and properties from Amplitude to external platforms using API-based integration patterns.

**User Identifier Mapping** involves synchronizing Amplitude's user_id and amplitude_id with destination platform identifiers such as email, external_id, and device_id to maintain user identity consistency across platforms.

**Property Field Mapping** enables synchronization of user properties and event attributes between Amplitude and destination platforms, supporting custom field transformations and data type conversions.

**Sync Cadence** defines the frequency and timing of data synchronization between Amplitude and destination platforms, with options including real-time, scheduled intervals, and manual triggering.

**Cohort Webhooks** provide custom endpoint integration capabilities with configurable payloads using Apache FreeMarker templating, enabling organizations to build custom activation workflows with in_cohort boolean flags and message_id deduplication.

## Technical Implementation and API Specifications

The destination catalog implements platform-specific authentication mechanisms including API keys, OAuth tokens, service account credentials, and endpoint configurations. Common technical patterns include:

**API Endpoints** utilize REST APIs with platform-specific rate limits, request size constraints (typically 2MB maximum), and retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for handling 429 throttling responses and 5xx server errors.

**Data Formats** primarily use JSON schema with platform-specific transformations, supporting Apache FreeMarker templating for custom payload generation in webhook destinations and custom integration scenarios.

**Security Requirements** include IP allowlisting for warehouse destinations, SHA256 hashing for advertising platforms, encrypted credential storage, and role-based access controls for managing destination configurations and data access permissions.

**Event Filtering** capabilities enable selective data forwarding based on event types, properties, and user segments, allowing organizations to control data flow granularity and reduce unnecessary data transfer.

## Advanced Integration Features

**Bidirectional Integrations** with platforms like Braze, Intercom, and VWO support both data export from Amplitude and import of external platform data, creating comprehensive cross-platform analytics workflows that enrich Amplitude's behavioral data with external platform interactions.

**Real-time Streaming** capabilities enable immediate event forwarding for time-sensitive use cases including fraud detection, personalization engines, customer support workflows, and real-time campaign optimization.

**Custom Webhook Integration** through Apache FreeMarker templating allows organizations to build sophisticated custom activation workflows with configurable payload structures, enabling integration with proprietary platforms and custom-built systems.

The destination catalog represents Amplitude's comprehensive approach to data activation across the modern marketing and product technology stack, enabling organizations to leverage behavioral analytics insights throughout their customer engagement ecosystem while maintaining data governance standards, technical reliability, and scalable integration architecture.
