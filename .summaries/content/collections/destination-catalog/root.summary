## Amplitude Destination Catalog

Amplitude's destination catalog is a comprehensive integration ecosystem that enables businesses to activate behavioral analytics data across marketing, product, and customer engagement platforms. The catalog features over 100 destinations supporting event streaming, cohort synchronization, and data warehousing capabilities, allowing organizations to operationalize behavioral insights throughout their technology stack.

## Core Integration Architecture and Data Flow Patterns

The destination catalog operates through three fundamental integration patterns that define how data flows from Amplitude to external platforms:

**Event Streaming Destinations** provide real-time forwarding of user events and properties to external platforms via APIs like HTTP V2 and Identify API. These integrations require authentication tokens, user ID mapping configurations, and support granular event filtering with property transformations to optimize data transfer.

**Cohort Sync Destinations** export Amplitude's behavioral cohorts to marketing automation, experimentation, and customer engagement platforms. These integrations enable precise audience targeting by synchronizing user segments with configurable cadences including real-time, hourly, daily, or custom scheduled intervals.

**Warehouse Destinations** facilitate bulk data export to cloud storage and data warehouse platforms, supporting recurring synchronization of raw events, merged user identifiers, and historical backfills with platform-specific schema formats and IAM configurations.

## Platform Categories and Strategic Use Cases

The destination catalog spans multiple platform categories, each serving distinct business functions:

**Marketing Automation & Customer Engagement** platforms including Braze, Customer.io, Klaviyo, HubSpot, Mailchimp, and Iterable receive cohorts and events to power personalized messaging campaigns across email, SMS, push notifications, and in-app communication channels.

**Advertising & Attribution** integrations with Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads, LinkedIn Ads, Snapchat Ads, and Twitter Ads enable behavioral audience targeting and conversion tracking through cohort synchronization and event streaming for campaign optimization.

**Product Experience & Onboarding** platforms like Appcues, CommandBar, Userflow, Candu, and Plotline leverage Amplitude cohorts to trigger personalized in-app experiences, product tours, contextual tooltips, and adaptive onboarding flows based on user behavior patterns.

**Experimentation & Feature Management** tools including Optimizely, LaunchDarkly, Split, and Statsig utilize Amplitude cohorts for experiment targeting and feature flag segmentation, enabling data-driven product development and A/B testing strategies.

**Data Infrastructure** integrations with cloud platforms like Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Snowflake, BigQuery, and Azure Blob Storage support enterprise-scale data export with specific IAM role requirements and schema compliance for data warehouse operations.

## Authentication and Configuration Framework

The destination catalog employs standardized authentication patterns across integrations:

**API Key Authentication** represents the primary authentication method, requiring platform-specific credentials including REST API keys, access tokens, and client secrets for secure data transmission.

**OAuth Authentication** provides enhanced security for advanced integrations through secure authorization flows, particularly for platforms requiring user consent and token refresh mechanisms.

**User ID Mapping** serves as a critical configuration requirement, establishing correspondence between Amplitude's `user_id` field and destination platform identifiers such as email addresses, external IDs, and device identifiers including IDFA and AAID.

**Property Mapping** enables transformation of Amplitude event properties and user properties to destination-specific field formats, with many platforms supporting custom field creation and data type conversion.

## Synchronization Mechanisms and Performance Characteristics

The catalog supports multiple synchronization patterns optimized for different use cases:

**Real-time Sync** capabilities provide immediate cohort updates and event forwarding with sub-minute latency, essential for time-sensitive applications like triggered marketing campaigns and real-time personalization.

**Scheduled Sync Cadences** offer configurable timing options including hourly, daily, and weekly intervals for batch cohort updates and bulk data exports, optimizing for platform rate limits and cost considerations.

**Bidirectional Integrations** with select platforms like VWO and Cordial enable data flow from external platforms back to Amplitude, creating comprehensive analytics feedback loops for enhanced behavioral insights.

## Technical Specifications and Operational Constraints

Event streaming destinations operate within defined technical parameters:

- **Request Size Limits** typically constrained to 2MB per request
- **Rate Limiting** with 429 HTTP responses and retry mechanisms using exponential backoff
- **Event Filtering** capabilities for selective forwarding of specific events and properties

Cohort sync destinations have specific operational requirements:

- **User Count Thresholds** often requiring minimum 100-1000 users for audience activation
- **Population Delays** ranging from 6-48 hours for audience processing and availability
- **Sync Frequency Limitations** based on platform-specific rate limits and processing capabilities

Data warehouse destinations require precise **IAM Role Configurations** with specific permissions including `kinesis:PutRecord`, `bigquery.transfers.get`, and `storage.objects.create` for secure data transfer operations.

## Advanced Customization and Templating Features

**Apache FreeMarker Templating** in webhook destinations enables sophisticated payload customization using variables like `${cohort_id}`, `${in_cohort}`, and `${computed_time}` for flexible integration patterns.

**Device Identifier Support** encompasses comprehensive cross-platform user matching through IDFA, AAID, IDFV, Android ID, and emerging identifiers like Unified ID 2.0 (UID2) for privacy-compliant user tracking.

**Custom Event Filtering** allows granular control over data transmission, enabling organizations to optimize platform costs and data relevance through selective event and property forwarding.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The destination catalog functions as Amplitude's primary data activation layer, bridging behavioral analytics with operational business systems. It enables organizations to transform analytical insights into actionable customer experiences across marketing automation, product development, and customer engagement workflows. The standardized integration patterns and comprehensive platform coverage position the destination catalog as a central component in modern customer data infrastructure, facilitating seamless data flow between Amplitude's analytics capabilities and the broader marketing and product technology ecosystem.
