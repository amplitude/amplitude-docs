## Amplitude Destination Catalog

Amplitude's destination catalog is a comprehensive integration ecosystem comprising over 100 destinations that enable businesses to activate behavioral analytics data across marketing, product, and customer engagement platforms. The catalog functions as the central activation layer for Amplitude's analytics platform, transforming behavioral insights into actionable customer experiences through downstream tool integrations.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The destination catalog operates through four primary integration patterns that serve different data activation use cases:

**Event Streaming Destinations** provide real-time behavioral data transmission using HTTP APIs, enabling immediate response to user actions across marketing automation, product experience, and customer engagement platforms. These integrations support selective event filtering, user property mapping, and real-time data transmission with configurable retry mechanisms and exponential backoff handling.

**Cohort Syncing Destinations** export user segments built within Amplitude's analytics platform to external systems for audience targeting and personalization. Cohort synchronization operates on flexible cadences (real-time, hourly, daily, scheduled) and supports multiple user identifier mapping strategies including email addresses, platform-specific user IDs, device identifiers, and custom user properties.

**Warehouse Destinations** facilitate bulk data export to cloud data warehouses and storage platforms, supporting historical backfills, recurring synchronization schedules, and structured data schemas optimized for business intelligence and advanced analytics workflows. These integrations provide partitioned event tables, merged user tables for identity resolution, and platform-specific data types (VARIANT/SUPER for JSON properties).

**Raw Events Integrations** enable comprehensive data export and ETL workflows by providing complete JSON-formatted event data including full event properties, user attributes, and Amplitude-specific metadata fields like `amplitude_id`, `uuid`, and `server_upload_time`.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Amplitude Export API JSON Format** serves as the standard event streaming schema, containing core fields including `user_id`, `event_name`, `event_properties`, `user_properties`, `created_at`, and `amplitude_id` for unique event identification and deduplication.

**Cohort Export Formats** include user identifiers, cohort membership status represented as `in_cohort` boolean values, computed timestamps for sync tracking, and optional user properties for enhanced targeting capabilities.

**User Identifier Mapping** represents the critical process of matching Amplitude users to external platform users through various identifier types:
- Email addresses (most universally supported)
- Platform-specific user IDs
- Device identifiers (IDFA, GAID, Android ID)
- Custom user properties
- Hashed identifiers (SHA256) for privacy compliance

**Sync Cadences** define the frequency of data transmission, ranging from real-time streaming for immediate activation to scheduled batch operations for bulk data processing and warehouse loading.

## Platform Ecosystem Integration

The destination catalog integrates with major technology platform categories:

**Marketing Automation Platforms** including HubSpot, Marketo, Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Braze, and Customer.io receive both event streams and cohort data for triggered campaign execution, lead scoring algorithms, and personalized messaging workflows.

**Advertising Networks** such as Google Ads, Facebook Ads, TikTok Ads, LinkedIn Ads, and Snapchat Ads consume cohort data through their respective APIs for audience targeting, lookalike modeling, and conversion tracking with automatic PII hashing for privacy compliance.

**Customer Engagement Platforms** including Intercom, Zendesk, OneSignal, and Airship leverage behavioral cohorts and real-time events for contextual messaging, support workflow automation, and user engagement campaign optimization.

**Product Experience Tools** such as LaunchDarkly, Optimizely, Split, and Statsig utilize cohort data for feature flag targeting, A/B testing audience creation, and experimentation workflow integration.

**Data Infrastructure Platforms** including Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, S3, and Azure Blob Storage receive structured event data for data warehousing, business intelligence reporting, and advanced analytics processing.

## Authentication and Security Framework

The catalog implements standardized authentication patterns across integration types:

**API Key Authentication** serves as the primary method for most destinations, requiring platform-specific API keys, tokens, or secrets for secure data transmission with configurable request size limits typically ranging from 1-4MB per request.

**OAuth Authentication** enables integrations with platforms requiring user consent and permission scoping, including Google, Facebook, HubSpot, and LinkedIn integrations.

**Service Account Authentication** supports cloud platform integrations through IAM roles, service account keys, and specific permission policies for AWS, GCP, and Azure destinations.

**Privacy and Compliance Features** include automatic PII hashing using SHA256 encryption for email addresses and phone numbers, selective data export capabilities for minimizing data exposure, regional data center support for geographic data residency requirements, and configurable anonymous user filtering.

## Performance and Reliability Architecture

The catalog implements comprehensive performance management:

**Rate Limiting Controls** vary by destination platform, from hundreds of requests per minute for real-time integrations to daily limits for audience synchronization operations.

**Retry Mechanisms** utilize exponential backoff with jitter for handling temporary failures, 429 throttling responses, and network connectivity issues.

**Request Batching** optimizes data transmission efficiency through platform-specific batch operation support and intelligent request sizing.

**Sync Monitoring** provides visibility into integration health, sync success rates, and error handling across all destination types.

## Integration Maintenance Model

Destinations are categorized by support and maintenance responsibility:

**Amplitude-Maintained Integrations** receive direct engineering support, updates, and feature enhancements from Amplitude's platform team.

**Partner-Maintained Integrations** are supported by destination platform teams using Amplitude's integration framework and standardized APIs.

**Community/SDK-Based Integrations** leverage Amplitude's plugin architecture for custom implementations and specialized use cases.

The destination catalog represents Amplitude's data activation strategy, enabling businesses to operationalize behavioral analytics insights across their entire technology stack for enhanced customer experiences, improved conversion rates, and data-driven business growth.
