## Amplitude Destination Catalog

Amplitude's destination catalog is a comprehensive data activation platform that enables businesses to operationalize their behavioral analytics data across 100+ marketing, product, and customer engagement platforms. The catalog serves as the bridge between Amplitude's behavioral analytics engine and the broader martech/product stack, facilitating real-time data activation for personalization, experimentation, and customer lifecycle management.

## Integration Architecture & Data Flow Patterns

The destination catalog operates on three foundational integration patterns that define how behavioral data flows from Amplitude to external systems:

**Event Streaming Destinations** provide real-time behavioral data activation through API-based integrations. These destinations leverage Amplitude's HTTP V2 and Identify APIs to forward user events, properties, and behavioral triggers immediately as they occur. This pattern enables instant personalization, real-time attribution, and immediate customer engagement responses based on user actions.

**Cohort Sync Destinations** export Amplitude's behavioral audience segments to external platforms for targeted campaigns and experiences. Cohorts represent users grouped by behavioral patterns, conversion events, or engagement metrics. These destinations support multiple synchronization cadences (real-time, hourly, daily, scheduled) and sync types (one-time exports, recurring updates) to maintain audience freshness across platforms.

**Warehouse Destinations** facilitate bulk data export to cloud storage and data warehouse platforms, supporting enterprise analytics workflows, machine learning model training, and cross-platform data consolidation. These integrations provide structured data schemas, historical backfills, and configurable export formats for downstream analytics processing.

## Platform Ecosystem Integration

The destination catalog spans five primary platform categories, each serving distinct use cases within the customer data activation workflow:

**Marketing Automation & CRM Platforms** including HubSpot, Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Braze, Customer.io, and Iterable receive behavioral triggers and cohort data to power sophisticated lifecycle marketing campaigns. These integrations enable behavioral email sequences, SMS campaigns, and multi-channel customer journeys driven by product usage patterns and engagement metrics.

**Advertising Networks** such as Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads, LinkedIn Ads, and Snapchat consume first-party behavioral data for audience targeting, lookalike modeling, and conversion optimization. These destinations enable behavioral retargeting, custom audience creation, and attribution measurement across paid media channels.

**Product Experience Platforms** including Appcues, CommandBar, Userflow, and Chameleon utilize behavioral cohorts and event streams to deliver personalized in-app experiences, contextual onboarding flows, and feature adoption campaigns. These integrations create dynamic product experiences based on user behavior patterns and engagement history.

**Experimentation & Feature Management Tools** like Optimizely, LaunchDarkly, Split, and Statsig receive cohort data for behavioral targeting of experiments and feature flag rollouts. This enables sophisticated experimentation strategies based on user segments, behavioral patterns, and product usage metrics.

**Data Infrastructure Platforms** including Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Snowflake, BigQuery, and Azure Blob Storage support enterprise data workflows with configurable export formats, automated scheduling, and data pipeline integration capabilities.

## Authentication & Security Framework

The destination catalog implements platform-specific authentication patterns to ensure secure data transfer:

**API Key Authentication** provides simple token-based access for platforms like Braze, Mixpanel, and Intercom, typically using bearer tokens or proprietary API key formats.

**OAuth Authorization** enables secure, permission-scoped access to platforms like Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and HubSpot through standard OAuth 2.0 flows with refresh token management.

**Service Account Authentication** supports cloud platform integrations using JSON key files, IAM roles, or service principal credentials for platforms like Google Cloud, AWS, and Azure.

**Custom Authentication Schemes** accommodate platform-specific security requirements, including Amplitude API keys, webhook signatures, and proprietary token formats.

User identifier mapping supports multiple ID types including email addresses, internal user IDs, mobile advertising identifiers (IDFA, GAID), and platform-specific identifiers. The system provides automatic PII hashing and data protection compliance for sensitive identifier types.

## Data Transformation & Processing Capabilities

Destinations support sophisticated data transformation to bridge schema differences between Amplitude and target platforms:

**Event Filtering** enables selective data forwarding based on event names, properties, or user segments, reducing data volume and improving relevance for downstream platforms.

**Property Mapping** provides custom field mapping between Amplitude's event schema and destination-specific data models, ensuring proper data structure alignment.

**Template Customization** utilizes Apache FreeMarker templating for webhook payloads and custom data formats, enabling flexible data structure modification for API compatibility.

**Schema Transformation** automatically converts Amplitude's behavioral event format into destination-specific schemas, handling data type conversions, field naming conventions, and structural requirements.

## Delivery Infrastructure & Reliability

The platform implements enterprise-grade delivery mechanisms with comprehensive reliability features:

**Rate Limiting Management** respects platform-specific API limits with intelligent request throttling, 429 response handling, and distributed rate limiting across multiple destinations.

**Retry Logic** employs exponential backoff strategies for failed requests, with configurable retry attempts and dead letter queue handling for persistent failures.

**Delivery Monitoring** provides real-time status tracking, delivery confirmation, and error reporting with detailed logging for troubleshooting and optimization.

**Request Size Management** handles 2MB request limits with automatic batching, payload compression, and request splitting for large data volumes.

## Enterprise Data Governance

Advanced enterprise features ensure secure, compliant, and auditable data activation:

**IP Allowlisting** enables secure data transfer through firewall-protected endpoints and VPN-restricted access patterns.

**Custom Webhook Configuration** supports configurable HTTP headers, authentication schemes, and endpoint customization for proprietary integrations.

**Historical Data Backfills** provide retroactive data synchronization for new integrations, supporting date range selection and incremental processing.

**Audit Logging** maintains comprehensive records of data exports, destination configurations, and user access patterns for compliance and governance requirements.

**Data Format Flexibility** supports JSON, CSV, and platform-specific export formats with automatic compression, partitioning, and schema validation.

The destination catalog represents Amplitude's comprehensive approach to behavioral data activation, providing the infrastructure foundation for data-driven customer experiences across the modern technology stack. Through its extensive integration ecosystem, robust delivery infrastructure, and enterprise-grade security features, the catalog enables organizations to operationalize behavioral insights at scale across their entire customer engagement workflow.
