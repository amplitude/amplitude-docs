Amplitude's destination catalog is a comprehensive data activation platform that enables businesses to distribute behavioral analytics data across their entire technology stack. The catalog features over 100 integrations spanning marketing automation, customer engagement, experimentation, advertising, and data infrastructure platforms, positioning Amplitude as a central behavioral analytics hub in the modern data ecosystem.

## Core Integration Architecture

The destination catalog operates through three primary integration patterns that address different data activation use cases:

**Cohort Syncing Destinations** export behavioral audience segments from Amplitude to downstream platforms. These integrations sync user cohorts based on product usage patterns, event sequences, and behavioral criteria to marketing platforms like Braze, HubSpot, Salesforce Marketing Cloud, and advertising networks including Facebook Ads, Google Ads, and TikTok Ads. Cohort destinations support flexible sync cadences (real-time, hourly, daily, scheduled) and multiple user identifier matching strategies including email addresses, mobile device IDs (IDFA, AAID), and custom user properties.

**Event Streaming Destinations** provide real-time forwarding of Amplitude events and user properties to customer engagement and experimentation platforms. Key streaming integrations include Customer.io, Intercom, Mixpanel, Optimizely, and LaunchDarkly. Event streaming supports selective event filtering, property mapping, and user profile creation/updates with configurable delivery mechanisms and payload transformation.

**Data Warehouse and Infrastructure Destinations** facilitate raw data export to cloud storage and analytics platforms including Amazon S3, Google BigQuery, Snowflake, Azure Blob Storage, and Amazon Kinesis. These destinations support recurring export schedules, historical data backfills, and multiple data formats (JSON, CSV) with advanced partitioning and deduplication capabilities for enterprise analytics workflows.

## Platform Ecosystem Relationships

The destination catalog demonstrates Amplitude's role as a behavioral data distribution layer connecting specialized platforms across the customer lifecycle:

**Marketing Automation Platforms** (HubSpot, Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Marketo, Mailchimp) receive behavioral cohorts for triggered email campaigns, lead scoring, and nurture sequences based on product usage patterns and engagement metrics.

**Customer Engagement Platforms** (Braze, Intercom, Customer.io, OneSignal) leverage real-time event streams and cohort data for personalized messaging across email, push notifications, SMS, and in-app communication channels.

**Experimentation and Feature Management** (Optimizely, LaunchDarkly, Split, Statsig) consume behavioral cohorts for experiment audience targeting and feature flag rollout strategies based on user behavior and product engagement.

**Advertising Networks** (Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads, Snapchat Ads) receive hashed user cohorts for custom audience creation, lookalike modeling, and retargeting campaigns across paid media channels.

**Product Experience Platforms** (Appcues, Pendo, CommandBar, Userflow) sync behavioral data for personalized onboarding flows, in-product guidance, and user experience optimization.

## Technical Implementation and Authentication

Destinations employ diverse authentication mechanisms reflecting the heterogeneous nature of the integration ecosystem:

- **API Key Authentication** represents the most common pattern for SaaS platform integrations
- **OAuth 2.0** flows for platforms requiring user consent (HubSpot, Google services, Facebook)
- **Service Account Keys** for cloud infrastructure services (Google Cloud Platform, AWS IAM roles)
- **Bearer Token Authentication** for various SaaS platforms and custom webhook endpoints

**Data Mapping and Transformation** capabilities include sophisticated user identifier resolution between Amplitude user_id and destination-specific identifiers, selective event and property filtering, custom payload templating using Apache FreeMarker for webhook destinations, and automatic data type conversion with field mapping configuration.

**Delivery Infrastructure** implements enterprise-grade reliability patterns including request size limits (typically 2MB), retry mechanisms with exponential backoff, HTTP 429 rate limiting handling, delivery status monitoring, and comprehensive error notification systems.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Amplitude Activation** refers to the product suite encompassing destination integrations and behavioral cohort creation capabilities within the Amplitude platform.

**Behavioral Cohorts** represent dynamic user segments defined by product usage patterns, event sequences, user properties, and engagement criteria that can be continuously synced to marketing and engagement platforms.

**User Properties vs Event Properties** distinction is fundamental for data mapping - user properties represent persistent user attributes and demographic data, while event properties contain contextual information specific to individual behavioral events.

**Amplitude ID** serves as the primary user identifier for data export operations, with merged Amplitude IDs providing user identity resolution across devices, sessions, and anonymous/identified user states.

**Sync Cadences** encompass real-time, hourly, daily, and custom scheduled options depending on destination platform capabilities and business use case requirements.

**Partner-Maintained vs Amplitude-Maintained** destinations indicate support responsibility, feature development ownership, and integration maintenance accountability between Amplitude and third-party platform providers.

## Data Warehouse and Analytics Infrastructure

Cloud data warehouse destinations (Snowflake, BigQuery, Amazon Redshift) support enterprise analytics workflows through:

**Recurring Export Schedules** with configurable hourly micro-batch processing for near real-time data availability in analytical environments.

**Historical Backfill Capabilities** enabling complete data migration and retroactive analysis for new warehouse implementations.

**Schema Management** with predefined Event and Merged User table structures optimized for analytical queries and business intelligence tools.

**Deduplication Functions** handling duplicate event processing during data pipeline execution and ensuring data quality in downstream analytics.

**Partitioning Strategies** based on server_upload_time and other temporal dimensions for query performance optimization and cost management.

## API Endpoints and Integration Patterns

The destination catalog implements standardized API patterns for different integration types:

**Cohort Sync APIs** facilitate behavioral audience export with endpoints following `/api/cohorts/sync` patterns for cohort destination updates and user list synchronization.

**Event Streaming APIs** utilize HTTP POST requests with JSON payloads to `/events/track` endpoints for real-time event forwarding and user behavior streaming.

**User Profile APIs** support user property synchronization through `/users/identify` endpoints for maintaining consistent user profiles across platforms.

**Webhook Destinations** provide flexible integration capabilities with custom payload templating, authentication header configuration, and retry logic for custom and emerging platforms.

The destination catalog represents Amplitude's comprehensive approach to customer data activation, enabling businesses to leverage behavioral analytics insights across their entire technology ecosystem for personalized customer experiences, data-driven marketing campaigns, and evidence-based product development decisions.
