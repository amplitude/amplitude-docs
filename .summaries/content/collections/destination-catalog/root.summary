Amplitude's destination catalog is a comprehensive data activation platform that enables businesses to distribute behavioral analytics data across their entire technology ecosystem. The catalog features over 100 integrations spanning marketing automation, advertising networks, product experience platforms, customer success tools, and enterprise data infrastructure.

## Core Product Architecture

The destination catalog operates through three primary integration patterns: **Event Streaming Destinations** for real-time behavioral data forwarding, **Cohort Synchronization** for audience-based targeting and personalization, and **Data Warehouse Destinations** for enterprise-grade data export and storage. Each category serves distinct use cases while maintaining consistent authentication, data mapping, and payload delivery mechanisms.

Event streaming destinations forward live user events and properties to platforms like Braze, Customer.io, Intercom, and HubSpot, enabling triggered campaigns and real-time personalization. Cohort synchronization distributes behavioral audiences to advertising networks (Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads, LinkedIn Ads) and marketing platforms (Mailchimp, Klaviyo, SendGrid) for targeted campaigns. Data warehouse destinations provide structured data export to Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, Snowflake, and cloud storage platforms for analytics and data science workflows.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Amplitude ID** serves as the primary user identifier (amplitude_id) alongside user_id for cross-platform user matching. **Cohort membership** is tracked through in_cohort boolean flags with computed_time timestamps indicating when membership was calculated. **User properties** represent behavioral attributes synchronized across destinations, while **event properties** contain contextual data forwarded with behavioral events.

**Sync cadences** define data delivery frequency including real-time streaming, hourly batches, daily syncs, and custom scheduled intervals. **User identifier matching** encompasses email addresses, device IDs (IDFA, AAID), external IDs, and custom user properties for cross-platform user resolution. **Payload structures** follow standardized JSON formats with Apache FreeMarker templating support for custom transformations.

## Authentication and Technical Specifications

Authentication methods vary by destination type: OAuth flows for social platforms (Facebook, Google, LinkedIn), API keys for SaaS integrations, service account credentials for cloud platforms, and bearer tokens for enterprise solutions. AWS integrations specifically require IAM roles with Amplitude account ID 358203115967 for secure data transfer.

Rate limiting follows platform-specific constraints including 2MB request limits for most streaming destinations, 1000 users/minute for platforms like Talon.One, and 24 API calls/day for TikTok Ads. SHA256 hashing is mandatory for advertising platforms to ensure PII compliance, while minimum audience thresholds (typically 1000 users) apply to advertising network cohort syncs.

## Data Export and Warehouse Integration

Cloud storage exports generate hourly partitioned JSON.gz files following projectID_yyyy-MM-dd_H#partitionInteger.json.gz naming conventions. Database schemas include standardized Event and Merged User tables with SUPER/VARIANT data types for JSON properties, BIGNUMERIC amplitude_id fields, and timestamp columns for event_time, client_event_time, and server_received_time.

Sync mechanisms support manual backfills for historical data, recurring syncs with configurable frequencies, and real-time streaming with micro-batch processing. Server_upload_time partitioning and amplitude_id deduplication ensure data consistency across warehouse destinations.

## API Endpoints and Integration Patterns

The catalog implements standardized API patterns including:
- **Cohort Sync APIs**: POST endpoints for batch user updates with cohort membership flags
- **Event Streaming APIs**: Real-time event forwarding with property transformation capabilities  
- **User Profile APIs**: Identify calls for user attribute synchronization
- **Webhook Endpoints**: Custom payload delivery with retry mechanisms and exponential backoff

## Broader Ecosystem Integration

Within Amplitude's product ecosystem, the destination catalog serves as the data activation layer that transforms behavioral insights into actionable customer experiences. It connects Amplitude's analytics platform to the broader martech, adtech, and data infrastructure stack, enabling closed-loop optimization where behavioral data drives personalization, which generates new behavioral data for analysis.

The catalog supports bidirectional data flow with select platforms, allowing not only data export from Amplitude but also enrichment of Amplitude profiles with external data sources. This creates a unified customer data ecosystem where behavioral analytics inform every customer touchpoint while external interactions enhance behavioral understanding.

Population delays (6-48 hours) for advertising platforms and configurable sync frequencies ensure optimal balance between data freshness and platform performance, while comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms maintain data reliability across the entire destination network.
