## Amplitude Destination Catalog

Amplitude's destination catalog is a comprehensive data activation platform that enables organizations to export behavioral analytics data to over 100 external platforms across marketing, customer engagement, experimentation, and business intelligence ecosystems. The catalog serves as the primary mechanism for operationalizing Amplitude's behavioral analytics insights across an organization's entire technology stack.

## Core Integration Architecture and Product Relationships

The destination catalog operates through three distinct integration patterns that form the foundation of Amplitude's data activation strategy:

**Event Streaming Destinations** provide real-time data forwarding capabilities, transmitting user events and properties from Amplitude to external platforms via APIs including HTTP V2 and Identify API. These integrations maintain continuous data synchronization with configurable event filtering, user property mapping, and delivery confirmation mechanisms.

**Cohort Sync Destinations** enable behavioral audience activation by exporting user segments from Amplitude to marketing and engagement platforms. These integrations support flexible sync cadences (real-time, hourly, daily, scheduled) and require sophisticated user identifier mapping across platforms using email addresses, user_id values, device identifiers, and custom external identifiers.

**Raw Data Export Destinations** facilitate enterprise data architecture by providing bulk data transfer capabilities to data warehouses and storage platforms. These integrations support historical backfills, recurring synchronization schedules, and structured data schemas with built-in deduplication and data integrity validation.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Cohort Sync Cadences** represent the scheduling mechanisms for audience synchronization, supporting real-time streaming, hourly updates, daily synchronization, and custom scheduled intervals with batch processing capabilities.

**User Identifier Mapping** constitutes the critical configuration layer enabling cross-platform user recognition through various identifier types including user_id, email addresses, device identifiers (IDFA, GAID, Android ID), platform-specific IDs, and custom external identifiers with deduplication logic.

**Event Streaming Configurations** encompass selective event forwarding through "Send Events" filters, property selection mechanisms, user forwarding toggles, and anonymous user handling policies that control data transmission scope and granularity.

**Payload Structures** follow standardized formats including cohort membership updates with `in_cohort` boolean flags, `computed_time` timestamps, `message_id` deduplication keys, and user property arrays that ensure consistent data representation across destinations.

**Schema Definitions** for data warehouse destinations include structured tables with `amplitude_id` primary keys, `event_properties` JSON/SUPER columns, `user_properties` dictionaries, and temporal partitioning by `server_upload_time` that enable efficient querying and analysis.

## Platform Categories and Integration Ecosystem

**Marketing Automation & Customer Engagement** platforms including Braze, Customer.io, Klaviyo, Mailchimp, HubSpot, and Salesforce Marketing Cloud enable personalized messaging campaigns based on behavioral cohorts and real-time event triggers. These integrations typically require API key authentication and support email, SMS, and push notification targeting capabilities.

**Advertising & Attribution Networks** encompassing Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads, LinkedIn Ads, and Snapchat Ads facilitate audience creation for retargeting campaigns using device identifiers, email addresses, and phone numbers with SHA256 encryption requirements for privacy compliance.

**Experimentation & Feature Management** platforms including Optimizely, LaunchDarkly, Split, and Statsig leverage behavioral cohorts for experiment targeting and feature flag segmentation, enabling data-driven product development workflows and A/B testing optimization.

**Data Infrastructure & Warehousing** destinations including Snowflake, Google BigQuery, Amazon S3, and Amazon Redshift support enterprise data architecture with structured schemas, partitioning strategies, and seamless integration with business intelligence tools for advanced analytics.

**Customer Success & Product Analytics** platforms including Planhat, Productboard, and Amplitude's own ecosystem components enable customer health scoring, feedback analysis, and product roadmap prioritization using comprehensive behavioral data insights.

## Technical Specifications and API Integration

**Authentication Mechanisms** vary by destination platform but commonly include API keys, OAuth tokens, service account credentials, and webhook authentication systems. Many integrations require specific permission scopes and role-based access controls for secure data transmission.

**Data Transformation & Filtering** capabilities enable selective event forwarding, property mapping, and payload customization using templating engines like Apache FreeMarker for webhook destinations, providing flexibility in data format and content adaptation.

**Rate Limiting & Error Handling** implementations include exponential backoff retry mechanisms, 429 throttling response handling, request size limits (commonly 2MB), and comprehensive delivery confirmation systems that ensure reliable data transmission.

**API Endpoints** commonly referenced include platform-specific ingestion URLs, authentication endpoints for token generation, and webhook callback mechanisms for bidirectional data flow. Many integrations support both production and sandbox environments with separate credential management systems.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The destination catalog integrates deeply with Amplitude's comprehensive product ecosystem, connecting with **Amplitude Data** for raw event exports, **Amplitude Activation** for real-time streaming capabilities, and **Behavioral Cohorts** for sophisticated audience segmentation. Portfolio projects enable cross-application data sharing, while organization-level configurations support enterprise deployment patterns and governance requirements.

The catalog represents a mature data activation platform that enables organizations to operationalize behavioral analytics insights across their entire technology infrastructure, supporting use cases from real-time personalization and marketing automation to long-term strategic analysis through comprehensive data warehouse integration patterns. This ecosystem approach ensures that behavioral data captured in Amplitude can be effectively leveraged across all customer touchpoints and business intelligence workflows.
