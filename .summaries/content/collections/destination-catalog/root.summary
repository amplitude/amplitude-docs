# Amplitude Destination Catalog

## Product Overview

Amplitude's Destination Catalog is a comprehensive integration solution that enables businesses to activate their product analytics data across marketing, customer engagement, and business intelligence platforms. It facilitates seamless data flow from Amplitude to third-party tools through two primary synchronization methods:

1. **Event Streaming** - Real-time forwarding of Amplitude events and user properties
2. **Cohort Syncing** - Exporting user segments created in Amplitude for targeted engagement

These integrations support use cases including personalized marketing, targeted product experiences, advertising optimization, data warehousing, and cross-platform analytics without requiring complex engineering work.
