# Amplitude Destination Catalog

Amplitude's Destination Catalog is a comprehensive data activation platform that enables businesses to operationalize behavioral analytics data across 100+ marketing, experimentation, and customer engagement platforms. The catalog functions as the central orchestration hub for configuring and managing data flows from Amplitude's analytics platform to downstream tools and services, supporting real-time event streaming, cohort synchronization, bulk data exports, and specialized API integrations.

## Core Integration Architecture

The destination catalog operates through four distinct integration patterns that address different data activation use cases:

**Event Streaming Destinations** provide real-time forwarding of user events and properties to external platforms, enabling immediate behavioral data activation for personalization engines, attribution systems, and engagement campaigns. These integrations require API key authentication, user ID mapping between Amplitude's identification system and target platforms, and support granular filtering of events and properties with typical 2MB request size limits.

**Cohort Sync Destinations** export Amplitude's behavioral cohorts (dynamic user segments) to marketing automation, experimentation, and customer engagement platforms. The sync mechanism operates through three file types: entering users (new cohort members), exiting users (removed members), and existing users (current membership), with configurable cadences ranging from real-time to daily intervals.

**Raw Events/Warehouse Destinations** facilitate bulk data export to cloud data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift) and storage systems (S3, GCS, Azure Blob Storage), supporting analytics workflows, data science initiatives, and compliance requirements through scheduled exports and historical backfills with JSON formatting and server_upload_time partitioning.

**Specialized API Integrations** encompass webhook destinations with Apache FreeMarker templating capabilities, User Profile API connections, and bidirectional sync integrations that combine data ingestion with export functionality for comprehensive data exchange workflows.

## Product Ecosystem Relationships

The destination catalog integrates with three core Amplitude product areas to deliver comprehensive data activation capabilities:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the primary data source, providing behavioral events, user properties, computed metrics, and segmentation capabilities that form the foundation for all downstream activations. The platform's event tracking infrastructure, user identification system, and behavioral analysis features generate the data assets distributed through destination integrations.

**Amplitude Activation** functions as the orchestration layer, managing real-time data flows, user identity resolution across platforms, sync cadence optimization, and delivery metrics tracking. This includes Identify API forwarding, HTTP V2 API integration, and comprehensive monitoring of data delivery success rates and error handling.

**Amplitude Data** handles enterprise-grade bulk export operations, warehouse integrations, and compliance-focused data delivery with features including manual backfills, data deduplication, integrity checking, and governance controls for sensitive data handling.

## Technical Nomenclature and Key Concepts

**User Identification and Identity Resolution**: The platform manages complex user identification mapping between Amplitude's internal system (amplitude_id, user_id, anonymous_id) and destination platform identifiers. Common mapping patterns include email addresses, external customer IDs, device identifiers (IDFA, GAID), platform-specific user tokens, and hashed identifiers using SHA256 encryption for privacy compliance.

**Cohort Synchronization Mechanics**: Behavioral cohorts represent dynamic user segments based on event patterns, property values, and behavioral criteria. Sync operations maintain cohort membership accuracy through differential updates, tracking user entry and exit events, and supporting various sync frequencies based on destination platform capabilities and business requirements.

**Event Streaming Protocols**: Real-time integrations implement diverse authentication mechanisms including REST API keys, OAuth 2.0 token exchange, bearer token authentication, and service account credentials. Streaming destinations support sophisticated event filtering, selective property transmission, and implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for reliability.

**Data Export Schema Standards**: Warehouse destinations export data in standardized JSON format with consistent schema including amplitude_id, event_properties (utilizing SUPER/VARIANT data types for flexible property storage), user_properties, timestamp fields, and metadata. Files follow naming conventions like projectID_yyyy-MM-dd_H#partitionInteger.json.gz with gzip compression for efficient storage and transfer.

## Integration Ecosystem Patterns

The destination catalog enables several critical business integration patterns across the marketing and product technology stack:

**Marketing Automation Workflows** connect Amplitude cohorts to platforms including HubSpot, Marketo, Salesforce Marketing Cloud, and Braze, enabling sophisticated triggered campaigns, behavioral lead scoring, and customer journey orchestration based on product usage patterns and engagement metrics.

**Advertising and Attribution Networks** integrate with Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads, Snapchat Ads, and other advertising platforms to enable precise audience targeting and conversion tracking. These integrations support hashed identifier transmission, device ID matching, custom audience creation, and lookalike audience generation based on behavioral cohorts.

**Customer Engagement Platforms** including Intercom, Customer.io, OneSignal, and Airship receive both cohort membership data and real-time behavioral events to power personalized messaging across email, push notifications, SMS, and in-app communication channels with behavioral trigger capabilities.

**Experimentation and Feature Management** tools such as Optimizely, LaunchDarkly, Split, and Statsig utilize Amplitude cohorts for sophisticated experiment targeting and feature flag conditions, enabling behavior-based testing strategies and gradual feature rollouts to specific user segments.

**Product Experience Platforms** including Appcues, CommandBar, Userflow, and Chameleon leverage cohort data to deliver personalized onboarding flows, contextual in-app guidance, and targeted feature adoption campaigns based on user behavior patterns and product engagement history.

## API Implementation and Technical Specifications

The destination catalog implements standardized API patterns and technical specifications across integrations:

**Authentication and Security**: Destinations support multiple authentication methods including API key generation from destination platforms, OAuth token exchange workflows, service account JSON credential management, and secure credential storage with encryption at rest and in transit.

**Webhook Configuration and Templating**: Custom webhook destinations provide Apache FreeMarker templating capabilities with variables including ${cohort_name}, ${user_properties}, ${in_cohort}, ${computed_time}, and custom property variables for flexible payload customization and dynamic content generation.

**Rate Limiting and Reliability**: The platform implements sophisticated rate limiting compliance with destination-specific restrictions, retry mechanisms with exponential backoff algorithms, 429 response handling, and comprehensive delivery metrics tracking. Common technical constraints include 2MB request size limits and platform-specific API rate restrictions.

**Data Validation and Compliance**: Integrations enforce strict data validation requirements including E.164 phone number formatting, ISO 4217 currency code compliance, SHA256 hashing for personally identifiable information, and platform-specific data format requirements for successful data delivery.

The Amplitude Destination Catalog represents a comprehensive data activation infrastructure that enables businesses to operationalize behavioral analytics across their entire technology ecosystem while maintaining enterprise-grade data governance, user privacy compliance, and integration reliability standards.
