# Amplitude Destination Catalog: Integration Ecosystem

## Product Overview

The Amplitude Destination Catalog is a comprehensive integration hub that enables businesses to activate their product analytics data across various platforms including marketing, customer engagement, advertising, data warehousing, and product experience tools. The catalog provides two primary integration methods:

1. **Event Streaming** - Real-time forwarding of Amplitude events and user data to third-party platforms
2. **Cohort Syncing** - Export of behavioral user segments from Amplitude to destination platforms

These integrations allow organizations to operationalize their product analytics data and create personalized customer experiences without extensive engineering resources.

## Product Relationships and Features

### Data Activation Methods

The Destination Catalog offers multiple ways to activate data:

- **Real-time Event Streaming**: Forwards events as they occur to trigger immediate actions
- **Scheduled Cohort Syncs**: Exports user segments on recurring schedules (daily, hourly)
- **Real-time Cohort Updates**: Maintains continuously updated user segments
- **One-time Exports**: Enables manual exports of cohorts or historical data

### Integration Categories

The catalog organizes destinations into functional categories:

1. **Marketing & Engagement Platforms**: Braze, Intercom, HubSpot, Customer.io, Iterable
2. **Advertising Networks**: Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads, Snapchat
3. **Data Warehouses**: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, Azure Blob Storage
4. **Product Experience Tools**: Appcues, CommandBar, Candu, Userflow
5. **Customer Feedback Systems**: Blitzllama, Enterpret, unitQ
6. **Feature Management**: LaunchDarkly, Split, Statsig

### Configuration Options

Each integration offers customizable settings:

- **User Identity Mapping**: Matches users across systems using various identifiers
- **Property Selection**: Controls which event/user properties to forward
- **Event Filtering**: Allows selective streaming of specific events
- **Custom Transformations**: Formats data using templates (especially in Webhooks)
- **Authentication Methods**: Supports API keys, OAuth, service accounts, etc.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Cohort**: A group of users defined by specific behaviors or attributes in Amplitude
- **Destination**: A third-party platform that receives data from Amplitude
- **Event Stream**: Real-time flow of user interactions and properties
- **Sync Cadence**: Frequency of data synchronization (real-time, hourly, daily)
- **User Property Mapping**: Configuration that matches user identifiers between systems
- **API Key/Secret**: Authentication credentials required for secure data transfer
- **Webhook**: Custom HTTP endpoint that receives formatted data payloads
- **OAuth**: Authentication protocol used by some destinations for secure access
- **Service Account**: Identity used for server-to-server authentication
- **Identify Forwarding**: Sending user profile updates to destinations

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Destination Catalog functions as a central hub in the customer data ecosystem with three key layers:

1. **Data Collection Layer**: Amplitude SDKs and APIs collect user behavior data
2. **Analytics Layer**: Amplitude processes and analyzes this data
3. **Activation Layer**: Destination Catalog enables taking action on insights

This structure allows teams to:
- Close the feedback loop between analysis and action
- Democratize data access across departments
- Reduce engineering dependencies for data activation
- Create consistent customer experiences across touchpoints

## Technical Implementation

### API Endpoints and Authentication Methods

1. **REST API Keys**: Most destinations use API keys (e.g., Braze, Customer.io)
2. **OAuth**: Some platforms use OAuth for authentication (e.g., HubSpot, Facebook)
3. **Service Accounts**: Google services typically use service account credentials
4. **IAM Roles**: AWS services use IAM roles with specific permissions

### Data Warehouse Integration Requirements

Data warehouse destinations typically require:
- IP allowlisting
- Specific permissions/roles
- Schema understanding for events and merged users tables
- Considerations for data volume and computation costs

### Webhook Implementation

The Webhooks destination supports:
- FreeMarker templating for payload customization
- Custom headers
- Retry mechanisms for failed deliveries
- Event filtering capabilities

### Technical Limitations

- **Rate Limits**: Many destinations impose API call limits
- **User Matching**: Proper identifier mapping is critical for successful integration
- **Data Size**: Some destinations limit payload size (e.g., Pushwoosh's 2MB limit)
- **Processing Time**: Large cohorts may take hours to sync completely
- **User Caps**: Some platforms limit the number of users in segments (e.g., Split's 100,000 user limit)
- **Authentication Expiration**: OAuth tokens may require periodic renewal
- **Privacy Compliance**: Many integrations handle PII and require proper data handling

The Amplitude Destination Catalog serves as a critical component in the modern data stack, enabling organizations to activate their product analytics data across their technology ecosystem for more personalized and effective customer experiences.
