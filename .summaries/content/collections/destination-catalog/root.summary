## Amplitude Destination Catalog

Amplitude's Destination Catalog is a comprehensive data syndication platform that enables organizations to operationalize behavioral analytics insights by syncing user segments and raw event data to external systems. The catalog supports bidirectional data flows across marketing platforms, data warehouses, and customer engagement tools, serving as the critical bridge between Amplitude's analytics capabilities and downstream activation use cases.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The destination catalog operates within Amplitude's broader ecosystem through **Amplitude Activation**, which serves as the orchestration layer for audience and data syndication. The catalog supports two distinct integration patterns:

**Data Warehouse Destinations** handle large-scale analytics exports, transferring raw event data, merged user profiles, and historical datasets to platforms like Snowflake through recurring sync mechanisms. These integrations prioritize data fidelity and support comprehensive business intelligence workflows.

**Marketing and Engagement Destinations** focus on real-time audience activation, synchronizing behavioral cohorts from Amplitude to customer engagement platforms like Airship. These integrations enable personalized messaging campaigns and targeted customer experiences based on behavioral segmentation.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Cohort Syncing**: The automated transfer of user segments defined in Amplitude to external platforms, enabling behavioral targeting across marketing and engagement tools.

**Raw Events Export**: Bulk transfer of unprocessed event data maintaining complete event fidelity, including all metadata, user properties, and event properties for downstream analysis.

**Merged User IDs**: Consolidated user identity resolution that unifies multiple identifiers (amplitude_id, user_id, device_id) into coherent user profiles across destination systems.

**Recurring Syncs**: Automated, scheduled data transfers that maintain continuous data freshness between Amplitude and destination platforms without manual intervention.

**Micro-batch Files**: Optimized data packaging format that balances transfer efficiency with computational costs when moving event data to warehouse destinations.

**UAChannelID**: Airship-specific user identifier that maps Amplitude user profiles to Airship's messaging channels for targeted communication delivery.

**Tag Group Synchronization**: The mechanism by which Amplitude cohorts are represented as tag groups in destination platforms, enabling audience-based campaign targeting and segmentation.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The destination catalog integrates deeply with Amplitude's core analytics platform, leveraging behavioral insights generated from user journey analysis to power downstream activation. The system standardizes authentication across destinations, supporting modern security methods including JWT token validation and key pair authentication while deprecating legacy password-based approaches.

The catalog enables organizations to create closed-loop marketing systems where behavioral insights from Amplitude directly inform targeting strategies across their entire marketing technology stack, from email platforms to advertising networks to customer support tools.

## Technical Implementation Details

**Snowflake Integration**:
- API endpoint pattern: `ORGNAME-ACCOUNTNAME.snowflakecomputing.com`
- Authentication methods: Key pair authentication (recommended) or password authentication (deprecated)
- Requires IP allowlisting for Amplitude's export infrastructure
- Standardized event table schema with columns: `amplitude_id`, `uuid`, `client_event_time`, `server_received_time`
- VARIANT data types for flexible event and user property storage
- Auto-suspend configuration recommendations for cost optimization

**Airship Integration**:
- Authentication via Airship API keys
- Channel ID mapping through Auto Channel ID functionality
- Integration with Airship's Message Composer for campaign targeting
- Automated tag group creation and management for cohort representation

The platform supports both historical data exports for initial system setup and ongoing incremental syncs to maintain data freshness, with micro-batch processing optimized for efficient data transfer while minimizing computational overhead on destination systems.
