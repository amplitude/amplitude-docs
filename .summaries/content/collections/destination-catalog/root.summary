## Amplitude Destination Catalog

Amplitude's destination catalog is a comprehensive integration ecosystem enabling businesses to activate behavioral analytics data across marketing, customer engagement, experimentation, and data infrastructure platforms. The catalog features over 100 destination integrations organized into distinct categories that support various data activation use cases.

## Core Integration Architecture and Product Relationships

The destination catalog operates through four primary integration patterns that form the foundation of Amplitude's data activation strategy:

**Event Streaming Destinations** provide real-time data forwarding capabilities, transmitting live event data and user properties from Amplitude to external platforms via APIs. These integrations maintain continuous data flow with event filtering, user identifier mapping, and authentication token management. Key platforms include Customer.io, Braze, HubSpot, and Google Analytics 4.

**Cohort Sync Destinations** enable behavioral audience activation by exporting Amplitude's user segments to marketing and engagement platforms. These integrations support multiple sync cadences (scheduled, one-time, real-time) and power audience targeting across platforms like Facebook Ads, Google Ads, Mailchimp, and Salesforce Marketing Cloud.

**Data Warehouse Destinations** facilitate bulk data export to cloud storage and analytics platforms, supporting raw event data and merged user profiles. These integrations include Amazon S3, Google BigQuery, Snowflake, and Azure Blob Storage, with capabilities for recurring syncs, historical backfills, and standardized schema formats.

**Specialized Destinations** serve targeted use cases including experimentation platforms (Split, Optimizely, LaunchDarkly), customer success tools (Planhat), feedback analysis systems (Enterpret, unitQ), and attribution platforms (AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch).

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Authentication Methods** encompass platform-specific security implementations including API keys, OAuth tokens, service account credentials, and webhook configurations. Integrations require specific permission scopes and role-based access controls tailored to each destination platform.

**User Identifier Mapping** represents the critical process of aligning Amplitude's user identification system (user_id, amplitude_id, User Properties) with destination platform identifiers such as email addresses, external IDs, device identifiers (IDFA, GAID), or platform-specific user IDs.

**Sync Cadences** define data transmission frequency patterns, ranging from real-time streaming to scheduled intervals (hourly, daily). Cohort destinations typically offer multiple cadence options while event streaming maintains near real-time data flow.

**Event Filtering and Property Selection** provide granular control over data transmission through configurable filters, property mappings, and transformation rules. Many destinations support Apache FreeMarker templating for advanced payload customization.

**Data Schemas and Formats** follow standardized structures, particularly for warehouse destinations using JSON formats with core fields including amplitude_id, event_properties, user_properties, server_upload_time, and client_event_time.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The destination catalog integrates seamlessly with Amplitude's product ecosystem through several key components:

**Amplitude Data** functions as the central configuration hub, providing the Data Catalog interface for destination setup, authentication management, and sync orchestration across all integration types.

**Amplitude Activation** specifically manages real-time event streaming and cohort syncing for marketing automation and customer engagement, supporting bidirectional data flows and advanced audience targeting capabilities.

**Behavioral Cohorts** serve as a core data product powering numerous destination integrations, enabling sophisticated audience segmentation based on user actions, properties, and engagement patterns derived from Amplitude's analytics engine.

**User Profile API** enables advanced destinations like Movable Ink to access comprehensive user data including computed properties, cohort memberships, and recommendations for personalized content generation.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation Patterns

**Cohort Sync APIs** utilize REST endpoints with standardized JSON payloads containing:
- cohort_name and cohort_id for segment identification
- in_cohort boolean flags for membership status
- computed_time timestamps for data freshness
- message_id for deduplication handling
- users arrays with comprehensive user_properties

**Event Streaming APIs** forward events using platform-specific formats requiring property mapping between Amplitude's event schema and destination requirements. These implementations include standardized rate limiting, retry mechanisms, and error handling protocols.

**Webhook Destinations** support custom endpoint configuration with:
- Configurable headers for authentication and routing
- Apache FreeMarker templating for payload transformation
- Retry policies with exponential backoff over 4-hour windows
- Custom error handling and monitoring capabilities

**Cloud Storage Integrations** implement service account authentication with specific IAM permissions (storage.objects.create for GCS, s3:PutObject for S3) and support partitioned file structures based on server_upload_time for efficient data organization.

The destination catalog represents Amplitude's comprehensive approach to data activation, enabling businesses to leverage behavioral analytics across their entire technology stack while maintaining data consistency, security, and operational efficiency through standardized integration patterns and extensive platform coverage.
