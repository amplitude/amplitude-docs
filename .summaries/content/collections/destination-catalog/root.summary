## Amplitude Destination Catalog

Amplitude's destination catalog is a comprehensive data activation platform that enables organizations to distribute behavioral analytics data across their entire technology stack. The catalog features over 100 destination integrations spanning marketing automation, advertising networks, experimentation platforms, data warehouses, and customer engagement tools, allowing businesses to operationalize their user behavior insights at scale.

## Integration Architecture and Product Relationships

The destination catalog operates through three distinct integration patterns that form the foundation of Amplitude's data activation strategy:

**Event Streaming Destinations** provide real-time data forwarding capabilities, transmitting user events and properties from Amplitude to external platforms via standardized APIs. These integrations maintain continuous data synchronization, supporting event filtering, user property mapping, and configurable delivery mechanisms with retry logic and error handling.

**Cohort Sync Destinations** enable behavioral audience segmentation by exporting user cohorts from Amplitude to marketing and engagement platforms. These integrations support multiple sync cadences (real-time, hourly, daily, scheduled) and facilitate audience targeting based on behavioral patterns and user journey stages.

**Raw Data Export Destinations** deliver comprehensive data warehouse and cloud storage integrations for analytics and business intelligence workflows, supporting recurring exports, historical backfills, structured schemas, and enterprise-grade data governance requirements.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Cohorts** represent behavioral audience segments created within Amplitude based on user actions, properties, and engagement patterns, which can be synchronized to external platforms for targeting and personalization.

**Event Streaming** refers to the real-time forwarding of user events and properties from Amplitude to destination platforms using standardized payload formats and API endpoints.

**User Identifier Mapping** encompasses the translation between Amplitude's user_id and user properties to destination platform identifiers, including email addresses, external IDs, advertising identifiers (IDFA, GAID), and custom user attributes.

**Sync Cadence** defines the frequency and timing of data synchronization between Amplitude and destination platforms, ranging from real-time streaming to scheduled batch exports.

**Event Filtering** provides selective data forwarding capabilities based on event types, properties, and user segments to optimize data delivery and platform-specific requirements.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The destination catalog serves as Amplitude's primary data activation layer, connecting behavioral analytics insights to operational business systems across the customer lifecycle. The platform integrates with four major ecosystem categories:

**Marketing and Customer Engagement** platforms including Braze, Customer.io, Klaviyo, Mailchimp, HubSpot, and Salesforce Marketing Cloud enable behavioral trigger campaigns, lifecycle marketing automation, and personalized messaging workflows through both event streaming and cohort synchronization capabilities.

**Advertising and Attribution Networks** such as Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads, LinkedIn Ads, and AppsFlyer support audience targeting, conversion tracking, and attribution measurement through cohort exports and conversion event forwarding with platform-specific identifier requirements and hashing protocols.

**Experimentation and Feature Management** platforms including Optimizely, LaunchDarkly, Split, and Statsig leverage Amplitude cohorts for experiment targeting and feature flag segmentation, enabling behavior-driven experimentation workflows and product optimization strategies.

**Data Infrastructure and Business Intelligence** destinations like Snowflake, Google BigQuery, Amazon S3, and Azure Blob Storage provide comprehensive data export capabilities with structured schemas, partitioning strategies, deduplication mechanisms, and enterprise security features for advanced analytics and reporting.

## Technical Implementation and API Endpoints

The destination catalog leverages multiple API endpoints and technical interfaces for data activation:

**Amplitude Export API** provides standardized JSON formatting for event data transmission, including fields such as amplitude_id, user_id, event_type, event_properties, user_properties, and timestamp information.

**Behavioral Cohorts API** enables audience segmentation and cohort membership management for targeting and personalization use cases across destination platforms.

**User Profile API** delivers real-time user data access for dynamic personalization and customer engagement workflows.

**Destination-Specific APIs** include platform-native endpoints such as Braze HTTP V2 API, Google Ads Upload Click Conversions API, Facebook Custom Audiences API, and various webhook implementations for real-time data delivery.

Authentication mechanisms span API keys, OAuth flows, service account credentials, and bearer tokens, with enterprise features including IP allowlisting, VPC security group configuration, KMS encryption support, and compliance with data residency requirements across multiple cloud regions.

The destination catalog represents Amplitude's strategic approach to behavioral data activation, transforming user analytics insights into actionable business outcomes through standardized integration patterns, robust security frameworks, and flexible configuration options that scale across enterprise technology environments.
