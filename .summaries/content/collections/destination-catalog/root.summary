Amplitude's Destination Catalog is a comprehensive integration ecosystem that transforms Amplitude's behavioral analytics platform into a central data activation hub, enabling businesses to sync user cohorts, stream events, and export data to over 100 third-party platforms across marketing, analytics, and customer engagement domains.

## Core Product Architecture

The destination catalog operates through three distinct integration modalities that serve different data activation use cases:

**Cohort Syncing** exports behavioral user segments from Amplitude to downstream platforms for audience targeting and personalized campaigns. This capability transforms Amplitude's behavioral insights into actionable audiences across advertising networks (Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads), marketing automation platforms (HubSpot, Marketo, Mailchimp), and customer engagement tools (Braze, Customer.io, Intercom).

**Event Streaming** provides real-time behavioral event forwarding to external systems, enabling immediate campaign triggers and personalization based on user actions captured in Amplitude. This supports platforms requiring real-time behavioral signals for in-the-moment customer experiences.

**Data Export** facilitates bulk data transfers to data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift), cloud storage systems (Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage), and ETL platforms (Fivetran) for advanced analytics, data science workflows, and cross-platform data consolidation.

## Platform Component Relationships

The destination catalog integrates with Amplitude's core platform components through specialized interfaces:

**Amplitude Activation** serves as the primary configuration interface for real-time cohort syncing and event streaming integrations. It provides sync cadence management (one-time, scheduled, real-time), delivery metrics monitoring, and user ID mapping configuration to ensure proper cross-platform user identification.

**Amplitude Data** handles enterprise-grade bulk data exports and warehouse destinations, offering recurring sync capabilities, historical backfills, data integrity validation, and compliance controls for regulated industries requiring audit trails and data lineage tracking.

**SDK Plugin Architecture** enables client-side integrations through DestinationPlugin implementations, allowing direct event forwarding from browser and mobile SDKs to platforms like Google Tag Manager, Hotjar, and FullStory without server-side routing.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Cohort Sync Cadence** defines the frequency and timing of audience updates, supporting one-time exports, scheduled synchronization (hourly/daily intervals), and real-time streaming based on destination platform capabilities and business requirements.

**User ID Mapping** represents the critical configuration layer that matches Amplitude's user identification schema (user_id, amplitude_id, device_id) with destination platform identifiers (email addresses, external_id, customer_id, advertising IDs) to maintain user identity consistency across the technology stack.

**Event Filtering** provides selective event and property forwarding capabilities, enabling businesses to control data volume, reduce costs, and ensure only relevant behavioral signals reach specific downstream platforms based on use case requirements.

**Authentication Protocols** encompass the security mechanisms required for each integration, including API key authentication, OAuth 2.0 token flows, service account credentials, webhook authentication, and platform-specific permission scopes that govern data access levels.

**Computed Properties** are derived user attributes calculated in Amplitude that can be synced to destinations, including behavioral scores, lifecycle stages, engagement metrics, and custom business logic outputs that enhance downstream personalization capabilities.

## Ecosystem Integration Patterns

The destination catalog enables several strategic data activation workflows:

**Marketing Automation Orchestration** flows behavioral cohorts from Amplitude to email platforms (Mailchimp, SendGrid, Constant Contact), marketing automation systems (HubSpot, Marketo, Pardot), and customer engagement platforms (Braze, Customer.io, Klaviyo) for lifecycle marketing campaigns, behavioral triggers, and personalized messaging sequences.

**Advertising Attribution and Optimization** combines event streaming to mobile attribution platforms (AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch, Kochava) with cohort syncing to advertising networks (Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads, Snapchat Ads) to enable closed-loop attribution measurement, lookalike audience creation, and campaign optimization based on downstream conversion events.

**Product Experience Personalization** syncs behavioral cohorts to in-app messaging platforms (Appcues, CommandBar, Userflow, Chameleon), product adoption tools (Pendo, WalkMe, Userpilot), and customer success platforms (Gainsight, ChurnZero) to deliver personalized onboarding experiences, feature adoption campaigns, and proactive retention interventions.

**Data Warehouse and Analytics Integration** exports raw events, merged user profiles, and computed properties to cloud data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, Databricks) and cloud storage systems to support advanced analytics, machine learning model training, customer data platform consolidation, and cross-platform business intelligence workflows.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

The destination catalog implements standardized API patterns across integration types:

**Cohort Sync APIs** utilize REST endpoints with JSON payloads containing cohort metadata (cohort_name, cohort_id, computed_time timestamps), user arrays with identification properties, and in_cohort boolean flags indicating membership status. Common endpoints follow patterns like `/api/v1/cohorts/{cohort_id}/users` with batch processing capabilities.

**Event Streaming APIs** provide real-time HTTP endpoints for behavioral event forwarding, typically implementing POST requests with event payloads containing user identification, event properties, timestamps, and platform-specific formatting. Rate limiting commonly enforces 2MB request size limits with exponential backoff retry mechanisms.

**Webhook Destinations** support custom HTTP endpoints with Apache FreeMarker templating for payload customization, configurable authentication headers, and retry logic for handling downstream system failures. These enable integration with proprietary platforms and custom internal systems.

**Cloud Storage APIs** implement bulk export protocols for AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage using IAM role-based authentication, hourly partitioned file delivery, and compressed data formats (JSON, CSV, Parquet) optimized for downstream processing.

**SDK Plugin APIs** provide client-side integration capabilities through standardized DestinationPlugin interfaces that implement setup(), identify(), track(), and flush() methods for real-time event forwarding from web and mobile applications.

The destination catalog represents Amplitude's strategic positioning as the central behavioral data hub in modern technology stacks, enabling businesses to activate user insights across their entire ecosystem while maintaining data consistency, user privacy compliance, and operational efficiency through standardized authentication, mapping, and delivery protocols.
