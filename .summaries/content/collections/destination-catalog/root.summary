Amplitude's destination catalog is a comprehensive data activation platform that enables businesses to distribute behavioral analytics data across their entire technology ecosystem. The catalog features over 100 integrations spanning marketing automation, advertising networks, customer engagement platforms, experimentation tools, and data infrastructure systems.

## Core Integration Architecture

The destination catalog operates through three fundamental integration patterns that address different data activation use cases:

**Cohort Syncing Destinations** export user segments built within Amplitude to external platforms for targeted marketing campaigns. These integrations transmit behavioral cohorts to platforms like Braze, Klaviyo, Mailchimp, Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads, Intercom, OneSignal, and Airship. Cohort syncs operate on flexible cadences including real-time, hourly, daily, and custom scheduled intervals.

**Event Streaming Destinations** provide real-time forwarding of Amplitude events and user properties to downstream systems. These integrations leverage Amplitude's HTTP V2 API and Identify API to stream behavioral data to platforms including Customer.io, HubSpot, Salesforce Marketing Cloud, and experimentation platforms like Statsig and LaunchDarkly. Event streaming supports selective filtering, property mapping, and cross-platform user identification.

**Data Warehouse and Storage Destinations** facilitate bulk export of raw events and merged user data to cloud storage and analytics platforms including Amazon S3, Google BigQuery, Snowflake, Azure Blob Storage, and Amazon Redshift. These integrations support hourly recurring syncs, historical backfills, and structured schemas optimized for downstream analytics workflows.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Amplitude ID (amplitude_id)** serves as the primary user identifier across all destinations, with **merged_amplitude_id** handling user identity resolution when multiple user sessions are consolidated. **User Properties** and **Event Properties** represent the core data structures transmitted to destinations, requiring field mapping between Amplitude's schema and destination-specific formats.

**Cohort Membership** is tracked through boolean flags (**in_cohort**) and **computed_time** timestamps, enabling destinations to understand user segment entry and exit patterns. **Sync Cadences** define data transmission frequency, ranging from real-time streaming to scheduled batch exports.

**Authentication Mechanisms** vary by destination but commonly include API keys, OAuth tokens, service account credentials, and webhook authentication. Most integrations require specific permissions and role configurations on destination platforms to ensure secure data transmission.

**Field Mapping** capabilities allow transformation of Amplitude user properties to destination-specific schemas, while **Property Filtering** enables selective transmission of events and user attributes based on business requirements.

## Platform Ecosystem Integration

The destination catalog integrates with distinct platform categories serving different business functions:

**Marketing Automation Platforms** (Braze, Customer.io, Klavivy, Mailchimp, Salesforce Marketing Cloud) receive cohorts and events for triggered campaigns, personalization engines, and lifecycle marketing workflows.

**Advertising Networks** (Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads, LinkedIn Ads, Snapchat Ads) consume cohorts for audience targeting, lookalike modeling, and conversion tracking with support for device identifiers (IDFA, GAID) and hashed personally identifiable information (PII).

**Customer Engagement Tools** (Intercom, Zendesk, OneSignal, Airship) leverage behavioral data for in-app messaging, push notifications, and customer support workflows.

**Experimentation Platforms** (Optimizely, LaunchDarkly, Split, Statsig) utilize cohorts for feature flag targeting and A/B test segmentation based on user behavior patterns.

**Data Infrastructure** (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, S3) receives structured event data for advanced analytics, machine learning model training, and business intelligence workflows.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

Destinations utilize various API patterns for data transmission:

- **REST APIs** for cohort syncing with endpoints like `/api/v1/cohorts` and batch user operations
- **Streaming APIs** for real-time event forwarding using HTTP POST to destination-specific ingestion endpoints
- **Webhook Destinations** supporting custom payload transformation using Apache FreeMarker templating
- **Cloud Storage APIs** for bulk data export with IAM role-based authentication and bucket policies

**Rate Limiting and Error Handling** are implemented across destinations with exponential backoff retry mechanisms, 429 throttling responses, and delivery metrics tracking. Request size limits typically range from 2MB to 4.25MB depending on destination capabilities.

## Data Transformation and Identity Resolution

The catalog supports extensive data transformation capabilities through **Identity Resolution** that maps between Amplitude's user identification system and destination-specific identifiers including email addresses, device IDs, customer IDs, and platform-specific user tokens. Many destinations require specific identifier formats and SHA256 hashing for PII protection.

**Payload Customization** through templating engines allows businesses to transform Amplitude's standard event schema into destination-specific formats while maintaining data integrity and compliance requirements. This includes support for custom field mappings, data type conversions, and conditional logic for payload construction.

The destination catalog represents Amplitude's comprehensive data activation strategy, enabling businesses to leverage behavioral analytics across their technology stack through standardized integration patterns, robust authentication mechanisms, and flexible data transformation capabilities that maintain data quality and security standards across all downstream systems.
