## Amplitude Destination Catalog

Amplitude's destination catalog is a comprehensive integration ecosystem that enables businesses to activate behavioral analytics data across marketing, product, and customer engagement platforms. The catalog features over 100 destinations supporting event streaming, cohort syncing, and data warehousing capabilities, allowing organizations to leverage their Amplitude analytics data throughout their technology stack.

## Product Architecture and Integration Patterns

The destination catalog operates through three core integration architectures:

**Event Streaming Destinations** provide real-time forwarding of user events and properties from Amplitude to external platforms using APIs like HTTP V2 and Identify API. These integrations require authentication tokens, user ID mapping, and support event filtering with property transformations as data flows between systems.

**Cohort Syncing Destinations** export Amplitude's behavioral cohorts to marketing and engagement platforms for audience targeting. These integrations operate on scheduled sync cadences (real-time, hourly, daily) and require user identifier mapping between Amplitude and destination platforms.

**Warehouse Destinations** deliver recurring data exports to cloud storage and data warehouse platforms, supporting both raw events and merged user ID tables with configurable sync frequencies and historical backfill capabilities for comprehensive data analysis.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Amplitude ID (amplitude_id)**: The primary user identifier in Amplitude's system used for deduplication and user tracking across sessions and devices.

**Cohort Sync Cadence**: The frequency at which cohort membership updates are transmitted to destinations, available in real-time, hourly, daily, or custom scheduled intervals.

**User ID Mapping**: The critical process of matching Amplitude's user_id field to corresponding identifiers in destination platforms such as email addresses, external_id, customer_id, or platform-specific user identifiers.

**Event Streaming**: Real-time forwarding of user events and properties from Amplitude to destination platforms as behavioral actions occur.

**Merged User IDs**: Deduplicated user records that combine multiple Amplitude IDs belonging to the same user across different devices and sessions, ensuring unified user profiles.

**Behavioral Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments created in Amplitude based on user actions, properties, and engagement patterns that can be continuously updated and synced to external platforms.

## Authentication and Security Framework

The catalog implements standardized authentication patterns across destinations:

- **API Key Authentication**: Token-based authentication using destination platform API keys for simple, secure access
- **OAuth Authentication**: Secure authorization flows for major platforms including Google, Facebook, and HubSpot
- **Service Account Authentication**: JSON key-based authentication for cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) with role-based access control
- **Bearer Token Authentication**: Token-based authentication using Authorization headers for RESTful API integrations

## Cloud Platform and Data Warehouse Ecosystem

The catalog provides comprehensive support for major cloud infrastructure providers:

**Amazon Web Services**: Integrations include Kinesis Data Streams, Kinesis Firehose, S3, and Redshift with IAM role-based authentication using Amplitude's designated account ID 358203115967 for secure cross-account access.

**Google Cloud Platform**: BigQuery, Cloud Storage, and Pub/Sub integrations requiring service accounts with specific IAM roles and permissions for data processing and storage.

**Microsoft Azure**: Blob Storage integration with service principal authentication and container-level permissions for secure data transfer.

**Snowflake**: Bidirectional integration supporting both password and key pair authentication with recurring sync capabilities for comprehensive data warehousing.

## Marketing and Advertising Platform Coverage

The destination catalog encompasses extensive advertising networks and marketing automation platforms:

**Advertising Networks**: Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads, Snapchat Ads, LinkedIn Ads, and Twitter Ads supporting cohort syncing for audience targeting and event streaming for conversion tracking and attribution.

**Marketing Automation Platforms**: HubSpot, Marketo, Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Braze, Iterable, and Customer.io with dual capabilities for both event streaming and cohort syncing to enable personalized marketing campaigns.

**Email Marketing Solutions**: Mailchimp, SendGrid, and Klaviyo integrations providing cohort-based audience segmentation and campaign targeting for improved email marketing effectiveness.

## Customer Engagement and Product Experience Tools

**Customer Support and Engagement**: Intercom, Zendesk-adjacent platforms, and communication tools supporting real-time event streaming and cohort-based targeting for personalized customer interactions.

**Product Analytics and Experimentation**: Optimizely, Split, LaunchDarkly, and VWO integrations for feature flag targeting and A/B testing with cohort-based audience segmentation for precise experiment targeting.

**In-App Messaging and User Onboarding**: Appcues, CommandBar, Chameleon, and Userflow integrations enabling personalized user experiences based on behavioral cohorts and real-time user actions.

## Technical Implementation and Performance Constraints

The catalog implements standardized data processing and performance management:

- **Request Size Limits**: Maximum 2MB request sizes with 429 HTTP response handling for rate limit management
- **Event Property Constraints**: Platform-specific limits on custom properties (e.g., HubSpot's 50 custom properties per event)
- **Rate Limiting**: Platform-specific API rate limits with exponential backoff retry mechanisms to ensure reliable data delivery
- **User Identifier Requirements**: Mandatory user ID mapping to prevent data duplication and ensure proper attribution across platforms

## Compliance and Regional Data Handling

The destination catalog addresses global compliance and data residency requirements:

- **Data Residency**: Support for EU, US, and Asia-Pacific regional endpoints for platforms like CleverTap and Customer.io to meet local data storage requirements
- **PII Protection**: SHA256 hashing requirements for personally identifiable information in advertising platforms to maintain privacy standards
- **GDPR Compliance**: Automatic data handling compliance for European user data across all applicable destinations

## API Endpoints and Technical Integration Methods

**Webhook Destinations**: Custom webhook endpoints utilizing Apache FreeMarker templating for payload customization with configurable headers for flexible data formatting.

**SDK Plugins**: Browser-based destination plugins for platforms like Google Tag Manager, Hotjar, and FullStory using Amplitude's DestinationPlugin architecture for client-side integrations.

**Batch Processing**: Micro-batch file processing for warehouse destinations with hourly partitioning and deduplication functions to optimize data warehouse performance.

The Amplitude destination catalog represents a comprehensive data activation platform that enables businesses to leverage behavioral analytics across their entire technology ecosystem while maintaining data consistency, security standards, and regulatory compliance. The catalog's standardized integration patterns and extensive platform coverage make it a central component of modern data-driven marketing and product development workflows.
