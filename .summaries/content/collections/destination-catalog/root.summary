## Amplitude Destination Catalog

Amplitude's destination catalog is a comprehensive integration ecosystem enabling businesses to activate behavioral analytics data across marketing, product, and customer engagement platforms. The catalog features over 100 destinations supporting event streaming, cohort synchronization, and data warehousing capabilities.

## Core Integration Architecture

The destination catalog operates through three primary integration patterns:

**Event Streaming Destinations** forward real-time user events and properties from Amplitude to external platforms using APIs like HTTP V2 and Identify API. These integrations enable immediate activation of behavioral data for personalization, attribution, and customer engagement workflows.

**Cohort Sync Destinations** export Amplitude's behavioral cohorts to marketing automation, experimentation, and advertising platforms. Cohorts synchronize on various cadences (real-time, hourly, daily, scheduled) and support different sync types including one-time exports and recurring updates.

**Warehouse Destinations** provide bulk data export capabilities to cloud storage and data warehouse platforms, supporting recurring syncs, historical backfills, and structured data schemas for analytics and machine learning workflows.

## Product Relationships and Integration Points

The destination catalog integrates with Amplitude's core analytics platform through several key components:

- **Amplitude Activation** powers real-time streaming integrations with platforms like Braze, Customer.io, and Intercom
- **Behavioral Cohorts** serve as the foundation for audience targeting across advertising networks (Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads) and marketing platforms
- **User Profile API** enables personalized content generation through integrations like Movable Ink
- **Export API** provides standardized JSON formatting for warehouse and storage destinations

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Cohort Sync**: The process of exporting user segments based on behavioral criteria to external platforms for targeting and personalization

**Event Streaming**: Real-time forwarding of user actions and properties from Amplitude to downstream systems

**User Identifier Mapping**: Configuration of how user identities are matched across systems using `user_id`, email, device IDs, or platform-specific identifiers

**Sync Cadence**: The frequency at which data is exported (real-time, hourly, daily, or custom scheduled intervals)

**Field Mapping**: Configuration of how Amplitude properties correspond to destination platform fields

**Micro-batch Processing**: Data processing method used by warehouse destinations to handle large volumes efficiently

## Authentication and Configuration Patterns

Destinations employ various authentication methods including:
- OAuth (HubSpot, Facebook Ads)
- API keys (most platforms)
- Bearer tokens
- Service account credentials (Google Cloud, AWS)

Common configuration requirements include user identifier mapping, field mapping for user properties and event parameters, sync cadence configuration, and event/property filtering capabilities.

## Major Platform Categories

**Marketing Automation**: Braze, Customer.io, HubSpot, Klaviyo, Mailchimp, Marketo enable cohort-based email campaigns and lifecycle messaging

**Advertising Networks**: Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads, LinkedIn Ads, Snapchat Ads support audience targeting with device identifiers (IDFA, GAID) and hashed PII

**Customer Engagement**: Intercom, Zendesk, Appcues, Chameleon enable in-app messaging and support workflows based on behavioral triggers

**Data Infrastructure**: Amazon S3, Google BigQuery, Snowflake, Azure Blob Storage provide scalable data export with structured schemas and partitioning

**Experimentation Platforms**: Optimizely, LaunchDarkly, Split, Statsig enable feature flag targeting based on behavioral cohorts

## Technical Implementation Details

**API Endpoints**: Destinations utilize platform-specific APIs such as:
- Braze's `/users/track` endpoint
- Google Ads Upload Click Conversions API
- TikTok Events API

**Data Formats**: Most integrations support JSON payloads with standardized schemas including `amplitude_id`, `user_id`, `event_properties`, and `user_properties` fields

**Rate Limiting**: Platforms implement various limits:
- TikTok Ads: 24 calls/day/audience
- MoEngage: 10k events/app/minute

**Data Processing**: Warehouse destinations support micro-batch processing, deduplication functions, and automatic integrity checks with backfill capabilities

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The destination catalog positions Amplitude as a central behavioral data hub within the modern data stack. By providing standardized connectors to marketing clouds (Salesforce Marketing Cloud), CDPs (Segment), attribution platforms (AppsFlyer, Adjust), and business intelligence tools, Amplitude enables organizations to create unified customer experiences across all touchpoints while maintaining data consistency and governance.

The catalog's extensive coverage spans both B2C marketing tools and B2B customer success platforms (Planhat, Productboard), demonstrating Amplitude's versatility across different business models and use cases, from e-commerce personalization to SaaS product adoption optimization. This comprehensive integration capability establishes Amplitude as the behavioral analytics foundation for customer data activation across the entire technology stack.
