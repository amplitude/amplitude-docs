## Amplitude Destination Catalog

Amplitude's destination catalog is a comprehensive data activation platform that enables organizations to operationalize behavioral analytics data across their entire technology stack. The catalog features over 100 destination integrations spanning marketing automation, customer engagement, advertising networks, experimentation platforms, and data infrastructure tools, facilitating the seamless flow of user insights from Amplitude's analytics platform to downstream operational systems.

## Product Architecture and Integration Patterns

The destination catalog operates through three core integration architectures that address distinct data activation use cases:

**Cohort Syncing Destinations** form the foundation of behavioral audience activation, enabling organizations to export segmented user groups from Amplitude to marketing and engagement platforms. These integrations support sophisticated user identifier mapping across email addresses, user_id values, and device identifiers, with flexible sync cadences including scheduled, one-time, and real-time synchronization patterns.

**Event Streaming Destinations** provide real-time behavioral data forwarding capabilities, transmitting user events and properties from Amplitude to downstream platforms through APIs, webhooks, and SDK plugins. These integrations feature selective event filtering, dynamic property mapping, and robust retry mechanisms with exponential backoff to ensure reliable data delivery.

**Data Warehouse and Cloud Storage Destinations** enable enterprise-scale bulk data exports to analytical data stores including Amazon S3, Google BigQuery, Snowflake, Azure Blob Storage, and Amazon Redshift. These integrations support recurring hourly synchronization, historical data backfills, and structured schema management for both raw event data and merged user profiles.

## Authentication and Configuration Framework

The destination catalog implements diverse authentication mechanisms tailored to each platform's security requirements, including API keys, OAuth flows, service account credentials, and bearer tokens. The configuration framework standardizes several critical components:

**User Identifier Mapping** enables precise user matching between Amplitude's user_id or User Properties and destination platform identifiers such as email addresses, external_id values, and device IDs, ensuring accurate audience targeting and personalization.

**API Credentials Management** handles platform-specific authentication tokens, keys, and endpoint configurations through secure credential storage and rotation mechanisms.

**Field Mapping and Transformation** provides flexible property mapping between Amplitude's event and user schemas and destination platform requirements, supporting data type conversions and field renaming.

**Sync Cadence Configuration** offers granular control over data synchronization timing, supporting real-time, hourly, daily, and custom scheduled sync patterns based on business requirements and platform capabilities.

## Marketing and Customer Engagement Ecosystem

The catalog's marketing automation integrations encompass leading platforms including HubSpot, Marketo, Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Braze, Iterable, Customer.io, OneSignal, Pushwoosh, and Airship. These destinations enable sophisticated marketing orchestration capabilities:

Behavioral cohort targeting leverages Amplitude's user segmentation to create highly personalized campaign audiences based on product usage patterns, engagement metrics, and conversion behaviors. Real-time event triggering enables automated workflow activation based on user actions, supporting immediate response to behavioral signals. Cross-channel messaging orchestration coordinates communication across email, push notifications, in-app messages, and SMS channels. Customer lifecycle automation utilizes product usage data to trigger appropriate messaging at critical user journey moments.

## Advertising and Attribution Network Integration

The catalog's advertising network destinations include Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads, Snapchat Ads, and TheTradeDesk, supporting comprehensive audience creation and conversion tracking through several key mechanisms:

Device identifier matching utilizes IDFA, GAID, and AAID values to connect Amplitude user profiles with advertising platform audiences. SHA256 hashing ensures privacy compliance while maintaining targeting effectiveness. Custom audience creation transforms behavioral cohorts into advertising platform audiences for precise targeting. Conversion API integration enables attribution measurement by connecting advertising exposure to downstream conversion events tracked in Amplitude.

## Experimentation and Feature Management Platform Integration

Experimentation platform destinations including Optimizely, LaunchDarkly, Split, and Statsig leverage Amplitude's behavioral data for enhanced testing and feature management:

Targeted experiment audience creation utilizes Amplitude cohorts to define precise user segments for A/B testing and feature rollouts. Feature flag segmentation applies behavioral data to control feature access based on user engagement patterns and product usage metrics. Pre-defined user segments enable consistent audience targeting across experimentation and analytics platforms. Causal analysis integration supports comprehensive experiment measurement by combining feature exposure data with behavioral outcome metrics.

## Data Infrastructure and Analytics Platform Integration

The catalog's data infrastructure destinations provide enterprise-grade export capabilities across cloud storage and warehouse platforms:

**Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage** destinations export data in JSON format with hourly partitioning, supporting both raw event streams and processed user data with configurable compression and encryption options.

**Snowflake, BigQuery, and Redshift** integrations maintain structured table schemas with automatic deduplication, supporting both append and merge operations for efficient data warehouse management.

**Streaming Platform Integration** includes Amazon Kinesis and Google Pub/Sub destinations for real-time data pipeline construction, enabling low-latency data processing and analysis.

**ETL Connector Integration** features Fivetran connectivity for automated data pipeline management, reducing operational overhead for data engineering teams.

## Technical Specifications and Constraints

The destination catalog operates within specific technical parameters that ensure reliable and scalable data delivery:

**API Endpoint Integration** utilizes platform-specific APIs including REST endpoints, GraphQL interfaces, and proprietary SDKs, with standardized error handling and response processing across all destinations.

**Rate Limiting Management** implements sophisticated rate limiting with constraints typically ranging from 10 to 1000 requests per minute, featuring intelligent retry mechanisms for 429 responses and exponential backoff algorithms to prevent API quota exhaustion.

**Data Size Constraints** enforce platform-specific limits including 2MB request limits for most event streaming destinations, with specialized constraints such as 64 bytes for Lantern and 1MB for Kameleoon integrations.

**Schema Validation** ensures data compatibility through required field mappings, data type validation, and naming convention enforcement aligned with destination platform requirements.

## Specialized Use Case Destinations

The catalog includes specialized destinations addressing specific business use cases:

**Customer Success Platform Integration** with Planhat and Gainsight enables proactive customer health monitoring through behavioral event streaming, supporting churn prediction and expansion opportunity identification.

**Product Analytics Enhancement** destinations including FullStory and Hotjar combine Amplitude's quantitative behavioral data with qualitative user session insights, providing comprehensive user experience analysis.

**Feedback and Research Platform Integration** with Qualtrics, Maze, and Enterpret merges behavioral cohorts with qualitative feedback data, enabling comprehensive user understanding and product improvement insights.

**In-App Experience Platform Integration** with Appcues, CommandBar, and Userflow leverages behavioral data for personalized onboarding flows and feature adoption campaigns, optimizing user activation and engagement.
