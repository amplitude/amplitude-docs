- **Event**: A user action or system occurrence tracked in Amplitude
- **User Property**: Attributes associated with a user in Amplitude
- **API Key/Secret**: Authentication credentials required to establish connections with destinations
- **Sync Cadence**: The frequency at which data is transferred
- **Webhook**: A custom HTTP endpoint that can receive data from Amplitude
- **OAuth**: An authentication protocol used by some destinations for secure access
- **Service Account**: A special type of account used for server-to-server authentication
- **IAM Role**: Identity and Access Management role used for AWS integrations

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's Destination Catalog functions as the activation layer in Amplitude's broader Customer Data Platform (CDP) capabilities, working in conjunction with:

1. **Amplitude Analytics**: Provides the behavioral data and cohorts that can be activated
2. **Amplitude Data**: Manages the data pipeline powering the integrations
3. **Amplitude Experiment**: Can leverage exported cohorts for targeted testing

The Destination Catalog completes the analytics lifecycle by enabling businesses to operationalize insights derived from Amplitude data.

## API Endpoints and Authentication Methods

### Authentication Methods
- API Key/Token (most common)
- OAuth (Facebook Ads, Google Ads)
- Service Account Credentials (AWS, Google Cloud)
- Basic Authentication (username/password)
- Bearer Token (platforms like Aampe)

### Common API Pattern for Cohort Syncing
```
POST /api/2/cohorts/sync
{
  "destination_id": "destination_id",
  "cohort_id": "cohort_id",
  "sync_type": "one_time|scheduled"
}
```

### Webhook Payload Template Example
```
{
  "user_id": "${user_id}",
  "cohort_id": "${cohort_id}",
  "in_cohort": ${in_cohort?c},
  "properties": {
    <#list user_properties as property, value>
    "${property}": "${value}"<#sep>,</#sep>
    </#list>
  }
}
```

Each integration has specific configuration requirements, supported features, and use cases as detailed in the individual documentation files.
