Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user engagement platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to enhance user onboarding, collect feedback, and improve retention, activation, and engagement metrics. The platform enables product, growth, and product marketing teams to create contextual, non-intrusive messaging experiences directly within their applications.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of three primary components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** are interactive, multi-step experiences designed for user onboarding and feature exploration. They support six form factors (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner, Checklist) and utilize behavioral triggers, strike detection, and rate-limiting mechanisms. Guides can be created using templates including Tour, Announcement, Checklists, Carousel, Banners, and Tooltips, each optimized for specific use cases from step-by-step onboarding to contextual help.

**Surveys** focus on feedback collection and user sentiment analysis, supporting four unique block types (Rating, Long answer, Short answer, List) with conditional logic for dynamic response branching. Survey templates include NPS, User feedback, Rating, Carousel, Banner Survey, and Tooltip Survey formats, with specialized analytics for NPS scoring and response aggregation.

**Resource Center** functions as an intelligent help widget that integrates external documentation repositories and provides search functionality, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. It features an Autopilot system that uses semantic search algorithms to automatically surface relevant articles based on page content analysis.

## Multi-Platform SDK Integration

The platform supports comprehensive cross-platform deployment through dedicated SDKs:

- **Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with Amplitude Browser SDK 2.0, third-party analytics providers like Segment, and Google Tag Manager
- **iOS SDK** (`Amplitude-Engagement-Swift`) supports Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods installation with iOS 15+ requirements
- **Android SDK** (`amplitude-engagement-android`) targets API Level 24+ with Jetpack Compose support
- **React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) provides deep linking and URL scheme handling

Each SDK provides consistent APIs for initialization (`engagement.init()`, `engagement.boot()`), screen tracking, element targeting, theme management, and preview mode functionality.

## Advanced Targeting and Personalization

The platform employs sophisticated targeting mechanisms including user segmentation, rollout percentages with bucketing units, and multiple trigger types (element appearance/clicks, time delays, smart delay, rage click, user confusion, event tracking). Page targeting utilizes CSS Selector and XPath patterns, while the priority system (Urgent, High, Medium, Low) manages content display with tiebreaker logic for active state management.

Personalization capabilities include the "Personalize with Variables" feature for dynamic content insertion using client-side user properties, comprehensive localization support with fallback behavior, and theme customization through the Theme Editor with Brand controls and Component editor sections.

## Analytics and Experimentation

Comprehensive analytics integration with Amplitude provides detailed event tracking including Guide Viewed, Guide Completed, Guide Dismissed, Survey Submitted, Survey Abandoned, and Resource Center interaction events. The analytics schema includes properties like Lifecycle UUID, Step ID, Variant ID, App Type, and Source.type for granular analysis.

Amplitude Experiment integration enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, with variant configuration, exposure event handling, and insights dashboard analytics for performance tracking.

## Content Management and Organization

The platform features a robust content management system with template creation for reusable starting points, tags system for organizational structure, and bulk management operations. Advanced throttling capabilities provide rate-limiting strategies using global settings and tag-based granular control.

## Key API Endpoints and Methods

Critical SDK methods include:
- `engagement.gs.show()` and `engagement.gs.reset()` for guide/survey display management
- `forwardEvent()` for event-based triggers
- `setSessionProperty()` and `_setUserProperties()` for user data management
- `updateLanguage()` for localization
- `setRouter()` for SPA configuration
- `addCallback()` for custom function registration

## Enterprise Features

Advanced capabilities include proxy setup through AWS CloudFront for unified distribution, comprehensive role-based permissions (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator), localization with AI-powered translation using Claude, and XLIFF file upload workflows. The platform supports Content Security Policy (CSP) configuration and provides extensive customization through custom CSS styling with amplitude-engagement class selectors.

The Resource Center's Website scraper feature enables automatic content ingestion from documentation repositories using URL extraction methods, advanced filtering with path inclusion/exclusion, and content selector overrides for precise targeting of page elements.
