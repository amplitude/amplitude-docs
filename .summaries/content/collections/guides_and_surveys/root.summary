Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to improve user retention, activation, and engagement through targeted onboarding experiences and feedback collection. The platform enables product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams to deploy contextual guidance and gather user insights directly within their applications.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of three primary components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** provide interactive in-product guidance through five distinct form factors: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual bubbles), Pin (persistent elements), Tooltip (hover information), Banner (notification bars), and Checklist (task lists). These guides support multi-step experiences with advanced customization including z-index positioning, text animations with typewriter effects, and interactive blocks containing buttons, images, and videos.

**Surveys** enable targeted feedback collection through four specialized block types: Rating blocks (supporting Stars, NPS, Emoji, and custom Rating labels), Long answer blocks for detailed responses, Short answer blocks for brief input, and List blocks for multiple choice options. The survey system implements conditional logic for dynamic response paths and supports pre-filling with user properties.

**Resource Center** functions as an intelligent help widget that integrates external documentation repositories, provides semantic search capabilities, and delivers contextual recommendations through Autopilot's automatic content surfacing algorithm.

## Multi-Platform SDK Implementation

The platform supports comprehensive cross-platform deployment through dedicated SDKs:

- **Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with Amplitude Browser SDK, third-party analytics providers, and Google Tag Manager
- **iOS SDK** (`Amplitude-Engagement-Swift`) supports Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods installation with iOS 15+ compatibility
- **Android SDK** (`amplitude-engagement-android`) requires Android API Level 24+ with Kotlin 1.8.22
- **React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) includes deep linking support and async storage integration

All SDKs share common initialization patterns using `AmplitudeEngagement` classes with `init()` and `boot()` methods, supporting user/device ID configuration, screen tracking, element targeting, and preview mode functionality.

## Advanced Targeting and Experimentation

The platform implements sophisticated targeting mechanisms through user segmentation (All Users vs Targeted Users with property/cohort filtering), behavioral triggers (element appearance/clicks, time delays, smart delay, rage click detection, user confusion), and page-specific targeting using CSS selectors and XPath expressions. Priority levels (Urgent/High/Medium/Low) with tiebreaker logic manage multiple eligible experiences, while display limits and cooldown periods prevent user fatigue.

**Amplitude Experiment integration** enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, with variant configuration, exposure event tracking, and comprehensive analytics through the Insights dashboard. Experiments support treatment vs control groups with configurable rollout percentages.

## Analytics and Performance Monitoring

The platform provides extensive analytics through Amplitude event tracking, including common properties like Lifecycle UUID, Step ID, and Variant ID for A/B testing. Generic events (Viewed/Dismissed/Completed) and specific events (Guide Engaged/Step Completed, Survey Submitted/Abandoned) enable detailed performance analysis. The Overview dashboard displays views/completions over time, rage close percentages, and real-time interaction feeds with Microscope integration for session replay analysis.

Survey analysis features include the Insights tab for aggregate data with NPS scoring and type-specific insights, time-based engagement charts with rolling window analysis, and the Responses tab for individual user response examination with sorting and filtering capabilities.

## Content Management and Localization

**Themes** provide comprehensive branding control through the Theme Editor with Brand controls and Component editor sections, supporting accent color customization, Google Fonts typography, form control styling, widget dimensions, and animation settings. Platform-specific themes ensure consistent brand identity across web and mobile experiences.

**Localization** supports multilingual content delivery through SDK locale initialization, Project settings language configuration, and translation workflows using both web interface and .xliff file methods. The system implements locale code resolution with fallback behavior for unsupported languages.

## Resource Center Intelligence

The Resource Center leverages **Autopilot** for automatic content recommendation using semantic search algorithms that analyze page context to surface relevant articles from configured repositories. Website scraper functionality supports URL extraction through direct URLs or CSV/XML sitemap upload, with advanced filtering options and content selector overrides for targeting specific page elements.

Recommendation sets function as customizable in-time articles with various action types including visit link, click element, run callback, open third-party chat, show guide/survey, open article, and play video. Priority-based display logic ensures relevant content surfacing with smart fallback mechanisms.

## Security and Infrastructure

The platform supports **AWS CloudFront reverse proxy** configuration using dual origins (cdn.amplitude.com for static assets, gs.amplitude.com for API requests with /sdk/ prefix) to circumvent domain blocking while maintaining low latency. Content Security Policy (CSP) directives ensure secure deployment, while serverZone configuration supports EU/US data residency requirements.

## Permission Management

A granular **role-based permission system** provides five access levels (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) with specific capabilities for viewing, editing, publishing guides/surveys, and running experiments. This system overrides base Amplitude user roles to provide specialized access control within the Guides and Surveys module.

## Key API Methods and Configuration

Essential SDK methods include `gs.show()`, `gs.reset()`, `gs.list()`, `gs.closeAll()` for guide management, `forwardEvent()` for event-based triggers, `setThemeMode()` for theme switching, `updateLanguage()` for localization, and `addCallback()` for custom button actions. Preview mode supports condition verification with `handlePreviewLinkIntent()` and URL scheme configuration for testing workflows.
