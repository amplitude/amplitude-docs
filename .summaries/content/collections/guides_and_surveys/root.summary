Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user engagement platform that replaces traditional popups with contextual, non-intrusive messaging experiences. The platform enables product, growth, and product marketing teams to enhance user onboarding, collect feedback, and improve retention, activation, and engagement metrics directly within their applications.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform operates through three interconnected components that deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** serve as interactive, multi-step experiences for user onboarding and feature exploration. They support six template types (Tour, Announcement, Checklists, Carousel, Banners, Tooltips) implemented through five form factors (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner, and Checklist). Guides feature advanced positioning capabilities, multi-step configurations, and interactive blocks including buttons, images, and videos.

**Surveys** focus on feedback collection through four specialized block types (Rating, Long answer, Short answer, List) with conditional logic enabling dynamic response branching. Survey templates include NPS, User feedback, Rating, and mobile Carousel formats, supporting various rating mechanisms including Stars, NPS, Emoji, and Rating labels.

**Resource Center** provides a searchable widget that integrates external documentation repositories and videos. It features semantic search capabilities, recommendation sets, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. The Autopilot feature automatically generates article recommendations by analyzing page content through semantic search.

## Multi-Platform SDK Implementation

The platform supports cross-platform deployment through dedicated SDKs:

**Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with Amplitude Browser SDK, third-party analytics providers like Segment, and Google Tag Manager. Core methods include:
- `engagement.init()` - SDK initialization
- `engagement.boot()` - User session activation
- `engagement.forwardEvent()` - Event forwarding
- `engagement.setThemeMode()` - Theme configuration
- `engagement.gs.show()` - Manual guide/survey display

**iOS SDK** (`Amplitude-Engagement-Swift`) supports Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods installation, utilizing the `AmplitudeEngagement` class with `accessibilityIdentifier` and `amplitudeView` modifier for element targeting, plus screen tracking via `amplitudeEngagement.screen()`.

**Android SDK** (`amplitude-engagement-android`) provides Jetpack Compose support through `.amplitudeView` modifier and traditional Android views using `contentDescription`/`tag` selectors, with `AmplitudeEngagement` class initialization and `handlePreviewLinkIntent` for preview mode.

**React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) integrates with `@amplitude/analytics-react-native`, featuring `getPlugin()` function, `handleURL()` deep linking, and plugin booting with user/device ID configuration.

## Advanced Targeting and Personalization

The platform employs sophisticated targeting mechanisms including user segmentation (All Users vs Targeted Users with rollout percentages and bucketing units), behavioral triggers (element appearance/clicks, time delays, smart delay, rage click, user confusion, event tracking), and page targeting rules using CSS Selector and XPath targeting.

**Personalization** operates through the "Personalize with Variables" feature, which dynamically inserts client-side user properties into guide and survey text blocks with fallback value support. The system supports comprehensive localization through SDK locale configuration, XLIFF file translation workflows, AI localization with Claude, and fallback behavior configuration.

## Analytics and Experimentation

All interactions generate detailed analytics events prefixed with `[Guides-Surveys]` in Amplitude, including common properties (App Type, Lifecycle UUID, Step ID, Variant ID) and specific events (Guide Viewed, Guide Completed, Survey Submitted, Survey Abandoned, Resource Center interactions).

**Amplitude Experiment integration** enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, with variant configuration, exposure event handling, and insights dashboard analytics for treatment vs control performance tracking.

## Enterprise Features and Management

The platform includes enterprise-grade capabilities:

**Throttling controls** manage artifact appearance frequency through configurable limits and time periods (day/week/month/session).

**Custom CSS styling** for web SDK enables branding customization through CSS class selectors targeting form factors and survey elements.

**Proxy support** operates through AWS CloudFront configuration for unified distributions.

**Role-based permissions** provide five access levels (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) with granular control over viewing, editing, publishing, and experiment execution capabilities.

**Themes system** enables comprehensive branding customization including colors, typography, form controls, widget dimensions, and animations through a Theme Editor interface.

**Content management** features include template creation for reusable starting points, tag-based organization with bulk operations, and comprehensive testing capabilities through preview mode with condition verification and live testing using cohort targeting.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Artifacts**: Collective term for guides, surveys, and resource center content
- **Form Factors**: Visual presentation modes (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner, Checklist)
- **Blocks**: Interactive elements within guides and surveys (buttons, images, videos, rating scales)
- **Bucketing Units**: User identification methods for targeting (User ID, Device ID, custom properties)
- **Lifecycle UUID**: Unique identifier for each artifact instance
- **Smart Delay**: Intelligent timing mechanism that waits for optimal user engagement moments
- **Rage Click**: Behavioral trigger detecting user frustration through rapid clicking
- **Semantic Search**: AI-powered content discovery in Resource Center
- **Throttling**: Frequency control mechanism preventing artifact over-exposure
- **Variant**: Different versions of artifacts used in A/B testing

## Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Guides and Surveys integrates seamlessly with the broader Amplitude ecosystem, leveraging user segments, cohorts, and analytics data from Amplitude Analytics. The platform provides dedicated insights dashboards for aggregate metrics, individual response analysis, and time-based engagement tracking with Microscope integration for session replay analysis. This creates a unified product intelligence platform where user behavior data informs engagement strategies, and engagement interactions feed back into the analytics pipeline for comprehensive user journey understanding.
