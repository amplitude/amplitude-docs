# Amplitude Guides and Surveys

Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product messaging and feedback collection platform that helps product teams improve user experience, drive product adoption, and gather actionable user insights. It serves as a sophisticated alternative to traditional popup components, enabling teams to guide users through their product journey while collecting valuable feedback.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Guides
Guides are in-product messages triggered by user behavior that help users complete tasks or explore features. They come in five form factors:

- **Modal**: Full-screen overlays for important announcements
- **Popover**: Contextual messages pointing to specific UI elements
- **Pin**: Small indicators that expand when clicked
- **Tooltip**: Subtle hints appearing on hover
- **Banner**: Persistent messages at screen top or bottom

These form factors can be implemented using five templates:
- **Tour**: Step-by-step product exploration instructions
- **Announcement**: Updates or new feature notifications
- **Checklist**: Task completion tracking for onboarding
- **Banner**: Persistent notifications
- **Tooltip**: Contextual help for specific UI elements

### Surveys
Surveys enable targeted feedback collection with three template options:
- **NPS (Net Promoter Score)**: Measures customer satisfaction and loyalty
- **User Feedback**: Custom questions for detailed insights
- **Rating**: Gathers initial reactions to product experiences

Survey blocks include various rating types (Stars, Rating labels, Emoji, NPS) and support conditional logic for creating dynamic response paths based on user input.

### Analytics
The platform provides comprehensive analytics for tracking guide and survey performance:
- Views and completions metrics
- User engagement patterns
- Survey response analysis
- Real-time interaction feeds
- Segmentation capabilities

### Experimentation
Integration with Amplitude Experiment allows for A/B testing and Multi-armed Bandit experiments to optimize guide and survey performance.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

### SDK Integration
The Guides and Surveys SDK enables deployment of interactive guides and surveys on websites or applications through:
- Amplitude Browser SDK
- Third-party analytics providers
- Google Tag Manager

```javascript
amplitude.engagement.boot({
  client: {
    configuration: {
      apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
      serverUrl: 'https://gs.amplitude.com',
      cdnUrl: 'https://cdn.amplitude.com'
    }
  }
});
```

### Localization
The localization feature serves content in multiple languages without creating duplicates by:
- Specifying user locale in SDK implementation
- Configuring supported languages in project settings
- Implementing fallback behaviors for missing translations

### Theming
Themes control guide and survey appearance, including:
- Colors and typography
- Component styles
- Animations
- Widget dimensions
- Light/dark mode support

### Testing and Preview
Preview mode allows testing before launch:
- Condition status checking (trigger, limit, throttle)
- User history reset
- Throttle limit bypassing
- Live testing with targeted cohorts

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Guide-Related Terms
- **Form Factors**: Visual presentation styles (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner)
- **Templates**: Pre-designed guide structures for specific use cases
- **Trigger Conditions**: Rules determining when and where guides appear
- **Display Limits**: Restrictions on guide display frequency
- **Smart Delay**: Automatic timing adjustment to preserve user experience
- **CSS Selector Triggers**: Targeting guides to specific UI elements

### Survey-Related Terms
- **NPS (Net Promoter Score)**: Customer loyalty metric on a 0-10 scale
- **Promoters/Passives/Detractors**: NPS respondent categories (9-10, 7-8, 0-6)
- **Conditional Logic**: Rules changing survey flow based on previous answers
- **Rating Blocks**: Components for collecting numerical or emoji-based feedback

### Analytics Terms
- **Lifecycle UUID**: Unique identifier for guide/survey instances
- **Viewed Event**: Triggered when a guide/survey is displayed
- **Dismissed Event**: Triggered when a user closes a guide/survey
- **Completed Event**: Triggered when a user finishes all steps
- **Survey Submitted**: Triggered when a survey is completed
- **Survey Abandoned**: Triggered when a user leaves without completing
- **Variant ID**: Identifier for experiment variations

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Guides and Surveys integrates with the broader Amplitude ecosystem:

### Amplitude Analytics
- Events from guides and surveys flow into Amplitude Analytics
- Microscope integration for detailed user-level analysis
- Filter cards for segmentation and cohort analysis

### Amplitude Experiment
- A/B testing capabilities for guides and surveys
- Multi-armed Bandit optimization
- Variant configuration and management
- Performance analysis through the Insights dashboard

### User Permissions System
Guides and Surveys has its own permission system that can override a user's base Amplitude role:
- **No Access**: Cannot view or edit guides/surveys
- **Viewer**: Can view but not edit
- **Member**: Can create and edit drafts
- **Manager**: Can publish and edit live guides/surveys
- **Administrator**: Full access including permission management

## API and Technical Implementation

### SDK Methods
```javascript
// Show a specific guide or survey
amplitude.engagement.show('GUIDE_ID');

// Reset user history
amplitude.engagement.resetUserHistory();

// Set theme mode
amplitude.engagement.setThemeMode('light' | 'dark' | 'system');
```

### Proxy Configuration
For environments with domain blocking, a reverse proxy can be set up using AWS CloudFront with dual origins:
- Origin for static assets: cdn.amplitude.com
- Origin for API traffic: gs.amplitude.com

### Content Security Policy
When implementing the SDK, the following domains need to be allowed:
- connect-src: https://gs.amplitude.com
- script-src: https://cdn.amplitude.com
- style-src: https://cdn.amplitude.com
- img-src: https://cdn.amplitude.com
