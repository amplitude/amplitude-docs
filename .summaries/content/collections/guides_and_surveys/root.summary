Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to improve user onboarding, collect feedback, and enhance retention, activation, and engagement metrics. The platform targets product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams seeking to create seamless user journeys through contextual guidance and feedback collection.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The platform consists of three core components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** provide interactive user onboarding and feature discovery through five form factors: Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner, and Checklist. Each form factor supports multi-step functionality with customizable properties including position controls, z-index configuration, text animation (typewriter effects), and interactive blocks (buttons, images, videos). Guides utilize five template types - Tours, Announcements, Checklists, Banners, and Tooltips - each optimized for specific use cases from step-by-step product exploration to contextual help.

**Surveys** enable targeted feedback collection through four unique block types: Rating (Stars, NPS, Emoji, Rating labels), Long answer, Short answer, and List blocks. Surveys support conditional logic for dynamic response paths and utilize a subset of guide form factors (modal, popover, pin). Survey templates include NPS, User feedback, and Rating surveys for comprehensive customer satisfaction measurement.

**Resource Center** functions as an intelligent help widget that integrates with the Guides and Surveys SDK, providing search functionality, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. The Resource Center features Autopilot, which uses semantic search algorithms to automatically generate content recommendations from documentation repositories based on page context.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**AmplitudeEngagement** - The core SDK class for initializing and managing guides and surveys across platforms (web, iOS, Android, React Native)

**Form Factors** - The visual presentation modes for guides and surveys: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual bubbles), Pin (persistent elements), Tooltip (hover information), Banner (top/bottom bars), and Checklist (task lists)

**Behavioral Triggers** - Event-based activation mechanisms including element appearance/clicks, time delays, smart delay, rage click detection, user confusion patterns, and custom event tracking

**Strike Detection** - System for identifying user interaction patterns that indicate confusion or frustration

**Rate-limiting/Throttling** - Frequency controls that manage how often guides and surveys appear to users, configurable by day/week/month/session periods

**Lifecycle UUID** - Unique identifier for tracking user progression through guide/survey experiences

**Variant ID** - A/B testing identifier for experiment tracking and performance analysis

**Recommendation Sets** - Curated collections of articles and content for the Resource Center, supporting personalized landing pages with various action types

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Guides and Surveys integrates deeply with Amplitude's analytics ecosystem through comprehensive event tracking and the Amplitude Experiment platform for A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments. The platform supports Microscope integration for session replay analysis and connects with third-party analytics platforms including Segment and Google Tag Manager.

The localization system enables multi-language content delivery through SDK locale configuration, AI-powered translation via Claude, and XLIFF file workflows. The platform maintains a sophisticated permission system with five access levels (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) that override base Amplitude user roles for granular access control.

## API Endpoints and SDK Methods

**Web SDK Core Methods:**
- `engagement.init()` - Initialize the SDK with API key and configuration
- `engagement.boot()` - Boot with user/device identification
- `engagement.gs.show()` - Display specific guides/surveys
- `engagement.gs.reset()` - Clear user history and state
- `engagement.gs.list()` - Retrieve available experiences
- `engagement.forwardEvent()` - Send custom events for trigger evaluation
- `engagement.setThemeMode()` - Configure light/dark/system themes
- `engagement.addCallback()` - Register callback functions
- `engagement.setRouter()` - Configure SPA navigation handling

**Mobile SDK Methods:**
- `AmplitudeEngagement.initialize()` - Platform-specific initialization
- `boot()` - User session initialization with properties
- `handlePreviewLinkIntent()` (Android) / `handleURL()` (iOS/RN) - Preview mode deep linking

**Key API Endpoints:**
- `/sdk/*` - Primary API routing pattern for proxy configurations
- `/sdk/admin/config` - Preview mode configuration endpoint

**Proxy Configuration:**
The platform supports AWS CloudFront reverse proxy setup with dual origins (cdn.amplitude.com for static assets, gs.amplitude.com for API requests) and specific cache behaviors for the critical `/sdk/*` path pattern.

The analytics system tracks comprehensive event schemas including Guide Engaged, Guide Step Completed, Survey Submitted, Survey Abandoned, Tooltip Marker Viewed, and rage close events, all filterable through Debug Mode and exportable via CSV for detailed analysis.
