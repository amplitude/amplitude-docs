# Amplitude Guides and Surveys

## Product Overview

Amplitude Guides and Surveys is an in-product messaging and feedback collection platform that helps product teams improve user experience, facilitate product learning, and gather user feedback. It serves as a sophisticated alternative to traditional popup components, enabling teams to enhance key metrics like retention, activation, and engagement.

The platform consists of two primary components:
- **Guides**: Behaviorally-triggered in-product messages that help users complete tasks or explore features
- **Surveys**: Targeted feedback collection tools for gathering specific user insights

## Key Features

### Guides
Guides offer five form factors:
- **Modal**: Full-screen overlays for important announcements
- **Popover**: Contextual messages appearing near specific UI elements
- **Pin**: Small indicators that expand when clicked
- **Tooltip**: Subtle hints providing contextual information
- **Banner**: Persistent messages at the top or bottom of the screen

These form factors are implemented through five template types:
- **Tour**: Step-by-step product exploration instructions
- **Announcement**: Updates or new feature notifications
- **Checklist**: Task-oriented guides for multi-step processes
- **Banner**: Persistent notifications
- **Tooltip**: Contextual help for specific UI elements

### Surveys
Surveys provide three template options:
- **NPS (Net Promoter Score)**: Measures customer satisfaction and loyalty
- **User Feedback**: Customizable questions for specific insights
- **Rating**: Collects initial reactions to product experiences

Survey blocks include various rating types (Stars, Rating labels, Emoji, NPS) and support conditional logic for creating dynamic response paths.

### Analytics
Both guides and surveys include analytics capabilities:
- **Overview Tab**: Filter cards, performance metrics, and interaction tracking
- **Insights Tab**: Aggregate survey data analysis
- **Responses Tab**: Individual user feedback with sorting and filtering
- **Microscope Integration**: Deep user behavior analysis

### Experimentation
Integration with Amplitude Experiment enables:
- A/B testing
- Multi-armed Bandit experiments
- Variant configuration
- Performance analysis

### Customization
- **Themes**: Control appearance elements (colors, typography, animations)
- **Localization**: Support for multiple languages
- **Properties**: Configuration and metadata management

## Product Relationships and Architecture

Guides and Surveys integrates with:
- **Amplitude Analytics**: For tracking user interactions
- **Amplitude Experiment**: For testing different guide/survey variants
- **Third-party analytics providers**: Through SDK integration

The implementation architecture consists of:
- **Guides and Surveys SDK**: Client-side rendering component
- **Amplitude Backend**: Manages targeting, analytics, and content delivery
- **Optional Proxy Configuration**: For domain blocking environments

## Key Nomenclature

### Guide-Related Terms

- **Templates**: Pre-designed guide structures
- **Trigger Conditions**: Rules determining when guides appear
- **Display Limits**: Controls for guide frequency
- **Smart Delay**: Prevents guides from appearing immediately on page load
- **Tiebreaker Rules**: Logic for selecting guides when multiple are eligible

### Survey-Related Terms
- **NPS**: Net Promoter Score metric for customer loyalty
- **Promoters/Passives/Detractors**: NPS respondent categories
- **Conditional Logic**: Rules changing survey flow based on responses
- **Survey Blocks**: Building components for surveys

### Analytics Terms
- **Lifecycle UUID**: Unique identifier for guide/survey instances
- **Viewed/Dismissed/Completed Events**: User interaction tracking
- **Survey Submitted/Abandoned**: Survey completion tracking
- **Variant ID**: Identifier for experiment versions

## Implementation and Integration

### SDK Installation Options

1. **Amplitude Browser SDK**:
```javascript
import * as amplitude from '@amplitude/analytics-browser';
import * as engagement from '@amplitude/engagement-browser';

amplitude.init('API_KEY');
engagement.boot({
  client: amplitude,
  // additional configuration
});
```

2. **Third-party analytics providers**:
```javascript
import * as engagement from '@amplitude/engagement-browser';

engagement.boot({
  forwardEvent: (event) => {
    // Send to your analytics provider
  }
});
```

3. **Google Tag Manager** integration

### Key SDK Methods
- `boot()`: Initializes the SDK
- `setThemeMode()`: Sets light or dark mode
- `addCallback()`: Registers event callbacks
- `reset()`: Clears user history
- `show()`: Manually displays guides
- `list()`: Returns available guides

### Proxy Configuration
For domain blocking environments, AWS CloudFront distribution can be configured to reverse proxy:
- `cdn.amplitude.com` for static assets
- `gs.amplitude.com` for API traffic

## User Permissions

Guides and Surveys has five access levels:
1. **No Access**: Cannot view or edit
2. **Viewer**: Can view published content
3. **Member**: Can create/edit drafts, cannot publish
4. **Manager**: Can create, edit, and publish
5. **Administrator**: Full access including permission management

## Advanced Features

### Localization
Supports multiple languages requiring:
- SDK locale specification
- Project settings for supported languages
- Translation fallback behaviors

### Experimentation
Supports testing with:
- Variant configuration
- Exposure event tracking
- Performance analysis

### Testing
Provides Preview mode with:
- Condition status indicators
- Reset User History option
- Ignore Throttle Limits option
