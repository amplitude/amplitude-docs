# Amplitude Guides and Surveys

## Product Overview

Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product messaging and feedback collection solution designed to enhance user experience, facilitate product learning, and gather user feedback. The product serves as a sophisticated alternative to traditional popup components, enabling teams to improve key metrics like retention, activation, and engagement through contextual interactions with users.

The platform consists of two primary components:
- **Guides**: In-product messages triggered by user behavior to help complete tasks or explore features
- **Surveys**: Targeted feedback collection tools with specialized templates for measuring satisfaction and gathering user input

## Product Relationships and Architecture

Guides and Surveys operates as an integrated component within the broader Amplitude ecosystem, with connections to:

1. **Amplitude Analytics**: All guide and survey interactions are automatically tracked as events in Amplitude Analytics, enabling teams to measure the impact of their in-product messaging
2. **Amplitude Experiment**: Enables A/B testing of guides and surveys through variant configuration and performance analysis
3. **Microscope**: Provides user-level insights for survey responses, allowing for deeper analysis of individual feedback

The product follows a client-server architecture where the client SDK communicates with Amplitude's servers to fetch guide and survey configurations, track interactions, and send response data.

## Technical Implementation

### SDK Installation

The Guides and Surveys SDK can be installed via:
1. Amplitude Browser SDK
2. Third-party analytics providers
3. Google Tag Manager

Basic implementation:
```javascript
import { boot } from '@amplitude/engagement-browser';

boot({
  client: {
    apiKey: 'YOUR-API-KEY',
    configuration: {
      serverUrl: 'https://gs.amplitude.com',
      cdnUrl: 'https://cdn.amplitude.com'
    }
  }
});
```

### Key SDK Methods
- `boot()`: Initializes the SDK
- `forwardEvent()`: Sends events to the SDK
- `show()`: Manually displays a guide or survey
- `reset()`: Clears user history for testing

### Proxy Configuration
For environments with domain blocking, a reverse proxy can be configured using AWS CloudFront with dual-origin configuration:
- Origin 1: cdn.amplitude.com
- Origin 2: gs.amplitude.com

## Targeting and Display Logic

Guides and Surveys uses a sophisticated targeting system that includes:
- **Audience targeting**: Based on user segments and properties
- **Trigger conditions**: Defines when and where guides appear
- **Priority settings**: Manages multiple guides competing for display
- **Display limits**: Prevents overwhelming users with too many messages
- **Guide statuses**: Draft/published/scheduled states
- **Active state behavior**: Includes tiebreaker rules for competing guides

## Analytics and Measurement

The platform provides comprehensive analytics through:
- **Overview Tab**: Performance metrics, filter cards, and interaction tracking
- **Insights Tab**: Aggregate survey data analysis
- **Responses Tab**: Individual user feedback

Survey-specific analysis includes:
- Type-specific insights (e.g., NPS breakdown into promoters/passives/detractors)
- Time-based analysis
- Response filtering and sorting
- Microscope integration for deeper user-level insights

## Customization Capabilities

The platform offers extensive customization options:
- **Themes**: Control colors, typography, animations, and component styles
- **Localization**: Support for multiple languages through SDK configuration and .xliff translation templates
- **Form Factors**: Various presentation styles with position settings and multi-step capabilities
- **Conditional Logic**: Create dynamic survey flows based on user responses

## Testing and Preview

A Preview mode allows testing guides and surveys before launch, featuring:
- Condition status indicators (trigger, limit, throttle)
- Reset User History option
- Ignore Throttle Limits option
- Manual event triggering
- Live testing with targeted cohorts

This comprehensive platform enables product teams, growth teams, and marketing teams to create contextual, targeted in-product experiences that enhance user engagement while collecting valuable feedback to inform product decisions.
