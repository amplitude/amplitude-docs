Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to improve user onboarding, engagement, and feedback collection. The platform targets product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams seeking to enhance retention, activation, and engagement metrics through contextual user guidance and data collection.

## Core Product Components

The platform consists of three primary components that work together to create cohesive user experiences:

**Guides** provide interactive in-product guidance through five distinct form factors: Modals (overlay dialogs), Popovers (contextual callouts), Pins (persistent markers), Tooltips (hover information), Banners (page-wide notifications), and Checklists (task-oriented workflows). Each form factor supports multi-step functionality, customizable positioning, advanced triggers, and interactive elements including buttons, images, and videos.

**Surveys** enable targeted feedback collection using four specialized block types: Rating blocks (supporting Stars, NPS, Emoji, and custom Rating labels), Long answer blocks for detailed responses, Short answer blocks for brief input, and List blocks for multiple choice selections. Surveys implement conditional logic for dynamic response paths and support the same form factors as guides (modal, popover, pin).

**Resource Center** functions as an intelligent help widget that integrates external documentation repositories, provides semantic search capabilities, displays recommended content through Autopilot automation, and offers quick links with customizable call-to-action buttons.

## Platform Architecture and Integration

The system operates through dedicated SDKs across multiple platforms: Web SDK (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`), iOS SDK (`AmplitudeEngagement`), Android SDK (`amplitude-engagement-android`), and React Native SDK (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`). All SDKs follow a consistent initialization pattern using `engagement.init()` and `engagement.boot()` methods with user identification through `user_id` and `device_id` parameters.

The platform integrates deeply with Amplitude's analytics ecosystem through automatic event tracking, including common properties like Lifecycle UUID, Step ID, and Variant ID for A/B testing. Key tracked events include Guide Engaged/Completed/Dismissed, Survey Submitted/Abandoned/Completed, and Tooltip Marker Viewed events, all filtered through Debug Mode capabilities.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Form Factors** define the visual presentation and interaction patterns for guides and surveys, each with specific positioning controls, z-index configuration, and behavioral properties like "click outside to close" and mask background overlays.

**Triggers** determine when guides and surveys appear, supporting element appearance detection, element clicks, time delays, smart delay algorithms, rage click detection, user confusion patterns, and custom event tracking through `forwardEvent()` methods.

**Targeting** encompasses user segmentation (All Users vs Targeted Users), rollout percentages with bucketing units, cohort filtering, page targeting rules using URL matching/regex patterns, and CSS Selector/XPath element targeting.

**Priority Levels** (Urgent, High, Medium, Low) manage display precedence when multiple experiences are eligible, with tiebreaker logic handling conflicts and active state management ensuring appropriate user experiences.

**Themes** provide comprehensive branding control through the Theme Editor, including Brand controls for accent colors and typography, Component editor for form controls and widget dimensions, and platform-specific customization for web and mobile experiences.

## Advanced Features and Capabilities

The platform supports sophisticated **Experimentation** through Amplitude Experiment integration, enabling A/B tests and multi-armed bandit experiments with variant configuration, exposure event handling, and performance analytics through the Insights dashboard.

**Localization** functionality includes SDK locale initialization, Project settings for language management, and three translation methods: web interface editing, AI-powered translation using Claude, and XLIFF file workflow integration with fallback behavior for unsupported locales.

**Analytics and Insights** provide comprehensive performance tracking through the Overview tab dashboard with views/completions metrics, rage closes percentage, real-time interactions feed, and Microscope integration for session replay analysis. Survey-specific analytics include NPS breakdowns with promoters/detractors/passives classification and CSV export functionality.

## Resource Center Ecosystem

The Resource Center operates as an intelligent content discovery system with **Autopilot** providing semantic search-powered recommendations that automatically surface relevant articles from configured repositories based on page context. **Recommendation Sets** create customizable in-time articles with various action types including visit link, click element, run callback, open third-party chat, show guide/survey, open article, and play video.

**Source Content** management supports documentation repositories and video sources with sync options, draft/published visibility states, and the Website scraper feature for URL extraction through direct URLs, CSV/XML sitemap upload, and advanced filtering with content selector overrides.

## Development and Testing Infrastructure

The platform provides comprehensive **Testing** capabilities through preview mode, allowing developers to verify trigger, limit, and throttle conditions before launch. The testing interface includes condition status indicators (green/yellow/blue), Reset User History functionality, Ignore Throttle Limits options, and manual event triggering for validation.

**Proxy Configuration** supports AWS CloudFront setup as a reverse proxy with unified distribution handling both `cdn.amplitude.com` for static assets and `gs.amplitude.com` for API requests, including critical `/sdk/*` path pattern routing for API functionality.

## Permission and Access Management

The platform implements a sophisticated **Role-Based Permission System** with five access levels: No access, Viewer (view published content), Member (edit drafts), Manager (publish and run experiments), and Administrator (full access). These permissions override base Amplitude user roles and provide granular control through the Guides and Surveys > Permissions interface.

**Tags** functionality enables organizational management through individual and bulk tag operations, filtering capabilities, and naming conventions that support campaign, feature, and team-based categorization across guides and surveys.

The platform integrates with third-party analytics providers including Segment, supports Google Tag Manager templates, implements Content Security Policy (CSP) nonce handling, and provides comprehensive callback registration through `engagement.addCallback()` for custom instrumentation and workflow integration.
