Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user engagement platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to enhance user onboarding, collect feedback, and improve retention, activation, and engagement metrics. The platform enables product, growth, and product marketing teams to create contextual, non-intrusive messaging experiences directly within their applications.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of three primary components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** are interactive, multi-step experiences designed for user onboarding and feature exploration. They support six template types (Tour, Announcement, Checklists, Carousel, Banners, Tooltips) and utilize five form factors (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner, and Checklist) with advanced customization options including position settings, z-index controls, text animations, and interactive blocks supporting buttons, images, and videos.

**Surveys** focus on feedback collection through four block types (Rating, Long answer, Short answer, List) with conditional logic for dynamic response branching. Survey types include NPS, Stars, Emoji, and Rating labels, with specialized analytics for aggregate metrics, individual response tracking, and export capabilities up to 10,000 responses.

**Resource Center** provides a searchable widget that integrates external documentation repositories and videos, featuring semantic search through Autopilot functionality, recommendation sets, quick links, and customizable call-to-action buttons.

## SDK Implementation and Platform Support

The platform supports multi-platform deployment through dedicated SDKs:

- **Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with Amplitude Browser SDK, third-party analytics providers like Segment, and Google Tag Manager
- **iOS SDK** (`Amplitude-Engagement-Swift`) supports Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods installation with SwiftUI integration
- **Android SDK** (`amplitude-engagement-android`) provides Jetpack Compose support with `.amplitudeView` modifier
- **React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) includes deep linking configuration and URL scheme handling

All SDKs support element targeting through CSS selectors, XPath, accessibility identifiers, and platform-specific targeting mechanisms, with screen tracking, theme management, and preview mode capabilities.

## Targeting and Personalization System

The platform employs sophisticated targeting mechanisms including user segmentation with rollout percentages and bucketing units, behavioral triggers (element appearance/clicks, time delays, smart delay, rage click, user confusion, event tracking), page targeting rules with URL matching patterns, and priority-based display logic with tiebreaker systems.

Personalization features include the "Personalize with Variables" functionality for dynamic content insertion using client-side user properties, localization support with SDK locale configuration and XLIFF file translation workflows, and theme customization through the Theme Editor with brand controls and component styling options.

## Analytics and Experimentation

Comprehensive analytics tracking occurs through Amplitude with events prefixed `[Guides-Surveys]`, capturing common properties (App Type, Lifecycle UUID, Step ID, Variant ID) and specific interaction events (Guide Viewed/Completed/Dismissed, Survey Submitted/Abandoned/Response, Resource Center interactions). The Insights tab provides aggregate metrics and trends with NPS breakdowns, while the Responses tab offers individual user response data.

Amplitude Experiment integration enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, with variant configuration, exposure event handling, and performance tracking through the insights dashboard.

## Key API Endpoints and Methods

**Web SDK Methods:**
- `engagement.init()` and `engagement.boot()` for initialization
- `engagement.gs.show()` and `engagement.gs.reset()` for programmatic control
- `setThemeMode()`, `updateLanguage()`, `setSessionProperty()` for customization
- `forwardEvent()` for third-party analytics integration
- `addCallback()` for custom actions

**Mobile SDK Methods:**
- `AmplitudeEngagement.boot()` with user/device ID configuration
- Screen tracking via `amplitudeEngagement.screen()`
- Element targeting through accessibility identifiers and view modifiers
- Preview mode handling with custom URL schemes

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Lifecycle UUID**: Unique identifier for each guide/survey instance that tracks user interactions across sessions
**Bucketing Units**: Mechanism for consistent user assignment to experiments and rollout groups
**Smart Delay**: Intelligent timing system that waits for optimal user engagement moments
**Rage Click**: Behavioral trigger detecting user frustration through rapid clicking patterns
**Throttling**: Frequency control system limiting artifact appearances per time period (day/week/month/session)
**Form Factors**: Visual presentation modes (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner, Checklist) that determine how content appears
**Variant ID**: Identifier for A/B test variations within experiments
**Autopilot**: AI-powered semantic search functionality for Resource Center content discovery

## Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Guides and Surveys integrates deeply within the broader Amplitude ecosystem, leveraging Amplitude Analytics for event tracking and user segmentation, Amplitude Experiment for A/B testing capabilities, and Amplitude Cohorts for audience targeting. The platform extends beyond Amplitude through third-party integrations with Segment, Google Tag Manager, and other analytics providers via event forwarding mechanisms.

## Management and Permissions

The platform implements a five-tier permission system (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) that overrides base Amplitude user roles, providing granular access control for viewing, editing drafts, publishing, and running experiments. Content organization utilizes tags for filtering and bulk operations, with template systems for creating reusable starting points.

Testing capabilities include preview mode for condition verification, cohort targeting for live testing, and throttling controls for managing artifact appearance frequency. The platform supports proxy configurations through AWS CloudFront for enterprise deployments and custom CSS styling for advanced theme customization.
