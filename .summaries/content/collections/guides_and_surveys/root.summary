Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that replaces traditional popups with contextual guidance and feedback collection systems. The platform enables product teams to deploy targeted onboarding experiences, gather user insights, and improve retention through three integrated components working within existing applications.

## Product Architecture and Core Components

The platform operates through three interconnected modules that deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** provide interactive user onboarding through five template types: Tours (multi-step walkthroughs), Announcements (single-message communications), Checklists (task-oriented guidance), Banners (persistent notifications), and Tooltips (contextual help markers). These utilize behavioral triggers, strike detection, and rate-limiting to optimize engagement without overwhelming users.

**Surveys** enable targeted feedback collection via four specialized block types: Rating blocks (Stars, NPS, Emoji, custom labels), Long answer blocks, Short answer blocks, and List blocks for multiple choice. Surveys support conditional logic for dynamic response paths and deploy through modal, popover, and pin form factors.

**Resource Center** functions as an intelligent help widget integrating external documentation repositories with semantic search capabilities, Autopilot automation for content recommendations, and customizable quick links. It can scrape website content, manage recommendation sets, and provide personalized landing pages with various action types including visit link, click element, run callback, open third-party chat, show guide/survey, open article, and play video.

## Form Factors and User Interface

The platform supports five primary form factors determining content presentation: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual bubbles), Pin (persistent elements), Tooltip (marker-based hints), Banner (top/bottom notifications), and Checklist (task-oriented interfaces). Each offers extensive customization including position controls, z-index configuration, text animation effects (typewriter), advanced trigger element interactions, multi-step navigation, and interactive blocks supporting buttons, images, and videos.

The Themes system provides comprehensive branding control through a Theme Editor with Brand controls and Component editor sections, enabling customization of colors, typography (Google fonts integration), form controls, widget dimensions, animations, and platform-specific styling for web and mobile applications.

## SDK Implementation and Multi-Platform Support

**Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with Amplitude Browser SDK using `amplitude.add(window.engagement.plugin())`, supports third-party analytics providers including Segment, offers Google Tag Manager template integration, and provides lifecycle management methods: `engagement.init()`, `engagement.boot()`, `engagement.gs.show()`, and `engagement.gs.reset()`.

**iOS SDK** (`AmplitudeEngagement`) supports Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods installation, utilizes `AmplitudeBootOptions` for user/device ID configuration, implements screen tracking and element targeting through `accessibilityIdentifier`, and supports preview mode with custom URL schemes.

**Android SDK** (`amplitude-engagement-android`) requires Android API Level 24+ and Kotlin 1.8.22+, uses `AmplitudeEngagement` class initialization with `AmplitudeBootOptions`, provides screen tracking capabilities, and supports preview mode through AndroidManifest.xml intent filter configuration.

**React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) includes deep linking support via `handleURL()`, requires `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` dependency, and implements plugin booting with user/device ID initialization.

## Targeting and Behavioral Triggers

The platform provides sophisticated targeting through user segmentation (All Users vs Targeted Users with cohort filtering), rollout percentage controls with bucketing units, and comprehensive trigger mechanisms including element appearance/clicks, time delays, smart delay, rage click detection, user confusion signals, and event tracking integration.

Page targeting utilizes CSS Selector and XPath targeting with URL matching rules (contains, matches, regex), while priority levels (Urgent, High, Medium, Low) and display limits with cooldown periods ensure optimal user experience. Active state management with tiebreaker logic handles multiple eligible experiences.

## Experimentation and A/B Testing

**Amplitude Experiment Integration** enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys through variant configuration, experiment exposure event handling, and insights dashboard analytics with performance overview metrics and time-based analysis. This integration allows teams to optimize user experiences through data-driven experimentation.

## Analytics and Performance Measurement

The platform generates comprehensive analytics events tracked through Amplitude, including common properties like Lifecycle UUID, Step ID, and Variant ID for A/B testing. Generic events (Viewed/Dismissed/Completed) and specific events (Guide Engaged, Guide Step Completed, Survey Submitted, Survey Abandoned) provide detailed interaction tracking.

**Survey Analysis** features include the Insights tab for aggregate metrics and trends with NPS-specific breakdowns and Microscope integration for session replays, plus the Responses tab for individual user response data with CSV export functionality and filtering capabilities.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Strike Detection**: System for identifying user confusion or frustration signals
**Rate-Limiting**: Mechanisms controlling frequency of guide/survey presentations
**Bucketing Units**: User segmentation method for rollout percentage controls
**Lifecycle UUID**: Unique identifier tracking user journey through experiences
**Autopilot**: Automated content recommendation system for Resource Center
**Cooldown Periods**: Time intervals between experience presentations to prevent user fatigue
**Tiebreaker Logic**: System for prioritizing when multiple experiences are eligible
**Smart Delay**: Intelligent timing mechanism for optimal experience presentation

## Localization and Content Management

The localization system supports SDK initialization with locale parameters, Project settings for language management, and three translation methods: web interface editing, AI-powered translation using Claude, and XLIFF file workflow integration with trans-unit source/target tags.

Content management includes tags for organizing guides and surveys with bulk operations support, draft/published status management with scheduling capabilities, and comprehensive permission systems with five access levels (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) that override base Amplitude user roles.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

The platform supports proxy configuration through AWS CloudFront as a reverse proxy using dual origins (cdn.amplitude.com for static assets, gs.amplitude.com for API requests with /sdk/ prefix) to circumvent domain blocking while maintaining low latency. Server zone configuration (US/EU) and Content Security Policy (CSP) nonce support ensure secure deployment across various environments.

Testing capabilities include preview mode for verifying trigger, limit, and throttle conditions before launch, with troubleshooting tools like Reset User History, Ignore Throttle Limits, and manual event triggering for comprehensive validation workflows.

## Broader Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Guides and Surveys integrates deeply with the broader Amplitude ecosystem, leveraging Amplitude Analytics for event tracking and user segmentation, Amplitude Experiment for A/B testing capabilities, and Amplitude Microscope for session replay analysis. The platform also supports third-party integrations including Segment for analytics, Google Tag Manager for deployment, and various chat platforms through Resource Center actions, positioning it as a comprehensive solution within modern product analytics and optimization workflows.
