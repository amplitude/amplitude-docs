Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user engagement platform that replaces traditional popup systems with contextual, non-intrusive messaging experiences. The platform empowers product, growth, and product marketing teams to enhance user onboarding, collect targeted feedback, and improve key metrics including retention, activation, and engagement through intelligent, data-driven user interactions.

## Core Product Components and Architecture

The platform operates through three interconnected components that deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** serve as interactive, multi-step experiences optimized for user onboarding and feature discovery. The system supports six distinct template types (Tour, Announcement, Checklists, Carousel, Banners, Tooltips) implemented across five form factors: Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner, and Checklist. Each guide supports advanced positioning logic, multi-step configurations, and rich interactive blocks including buttons, images, and videos for enhanced user engagement.

**Surveys** focus on systematic feedback collection through four specialized block types: Rating, Long answer, Short answer, and List responses. The survey engine incorporates conditional logic for dynamic response branching, supporting multiple template formats including NPS, User feedback, Rating, and mobile Carousel configurations. Rating mechanisms include Stars, NPS, Emoji, and custom Rating labels to accommodate diverse feedback collection needs.

**Resource Center** functions as an intelligent help widget that integrates external documentation repositories with semantic search capabilities. The component features an Autopilot system that automatically surfaces relevant articles through page content analysis, providing personalized content recommendations based on user context and behavior patterns.

## Multi-Platform SDK Integration

The platform provides comprehensive SDK support across all major development environments:

- **Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with Amplitude Browser SDK, third-party analytics providers including Segment, and Google Tag Manager for flexible implementation
- **iOS SDK** (`Amplitude-Engagement-Swift`) supports Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods installation with native SwiftUI integration via the `amplitudeView` modifier
- **Android SDK** (`amplitude-engagement-android`) provides Jetpack Compose support through the `.amplitudeView` modifier and traditional view targeting using `contentDescription` and `tag` selectors
- **React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) delivers cross-platform functionality with deep linking support for unified mobile experiences

## Advanced Targeting and Behavioral Intelligence

The platform employs sophisticated targeting mechanisms for precise user engagement:

**User Targeting** utilizes segment-based targeting with configurable rollout percentages and bucketing units for controlled deployment. **Behavioral Triggers** include element appearance/clicks, time delays, smart delay algorithms, rage click detection, user confusion detection, and custom event tracking for contextual activation.

**Page Targeting** implements URL matching patterns with CSS Selector and XPath support for precise placement control. The system manages content priority through a four-tier system (Urgent, High, Medium, Low) with intelligent tiebreaker logic to resolve conflicts.

**Personalization** capabilities enable dynamic content insertion using client-side user properties with fallback values, ensuring consistent experiences across diverse user segments.

## Analytics Integration and Experimentation Framework

Comprehensive analytics tracking integrates with Amplitude through standardized events prefixed `[Guides-Surveys]`:

- **Guide Events**: Guide Viewed, Guide Completed, Guide Engaged, Guide Dismissed
- **Survey Events**: Survey Submitted, Survey Abandoned, Survey Response
- **Resource Center Events**: Article interactions and search behaviors
- **Common Properties**: App Type, Lifecycle UUID, Step ID, Variant ID, Source type

The platform integrates with Amplitude Experiment for A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments, providing variant configuration, exposure event handling, and performance analytics through the Insights dashboard for data-driven optimization.

## Enterprise Content Management

The system supports enterprise-scale content operations through:

**Template System** provides reusable starting points for guides and surveys with granular visibility management. **Themes** enable comprehensive branding customization including colors, typography, form controls, and animations for consistent brand experiences.

**Localization** supports multi-language deployments via SDK locale configuration, XLIFF file workflows, and AI-powered translation using Claude for automated content adaptation. **Tags** provide organizational structure for content categorization and bulk operations management.

## Quality Assurance and Testing Infrastructure

Robust testing capabilities ensure reliable deployment:

**Preview Mode** enables condition verification (trigger, limit, throttle) with real-time status indicators for pre-deployment validation. **Live Testing** supports cohort-based testing with comprehensive user history management for iterative optimization.

**Debug Features** include the `_startNudgeDebug()` function for desktop app previewing and condition troubleshooting, enabling developers to validate implementation before production deployment.

## Enterprise Security and Access Control

The platform implements enterprise-grade security through a five-tier permission system (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) that overrides base Amplitude user roles, providing granular control over viewing, editing, publishing, and experiment execution capabilities.

Additional enterprise features include proxy support via AWS CloudFront for unified content delivery, Content Security Policy (CSP) compliance, custom CSS styling capabilities, and comprehensive throttling controls to manage artifact display frequency across configurable time periods (day/week/month/session).

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Guides and Surveys integrates seamlessly into the broader Amplitude product ecosystem, leveraging existing user segmentation, analytics infrastructure, and experimentation frameworks. The platform maintains performance through intelligent caching, rate limiting, and optimized content delivery mechanisms while providing unified user identity management across all Amplitude products.

The system's architecture enables organizations to create cohesive user engagement strategies that span the entire customer lifecycle, from initial onboarding through advanced feature adoption, while maintaining consistent data collection and analysis standards across all touchpoints.
