# Amplitude Guides and Surveys

## Product Overview

Amplitude Guides and Surveys is an in-product messaging and feedback collection solution that helps improve user experience, facilitate product learning, gather user feedback, and enhance key metrics like retention, activation, and engagement. It provides contextual and less disruptive alternatives to traditional popup components for engaging users within digital products.

The platform consists of two main components:

1. **Guides**: In-product messages in various formats (Tours, Announcements, Checklists, Banners, Tooltips) that help users complete tasks or explore features.

2. **Surveys**: Targeted feedback collection tools with templates for NPS (Net Promoter Score), User Feedback, and Rating surveys.

The solution is designed for product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams to optimize user journeys and improve product metrics.

## Technical Implementation

### SDK Implementation

```javascript
// Installation via npm
npm install @amplitude/analytics-browser @amplitude/engagement-browser

// Basic initialization
import { boot } from '@amplitude/engagement-browser';

boot({
  client: {
    apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',

});

// Advanced configuration with callbacks
boot({

    configuration: {
      serverUrl: 'https://api.amplitude.com',
    }
  },
  callbacks: {
    onGuideStarted: (guide) => {
      console.log('Guide started:', guide);
    },
    onGuideDismissed: (guide) => {
      console.log('Guide dismissed:', guide);
    }
  }
});
```

### API Methods

- `boot()`: Initialize the SDK
- `forwardEvent()`: Send custom events to the SDK
- `setThemeMode()`: Toggle between light/dark themes
- `addCallback()`: Add event handlers
- `setRouter()`: Configure SPA navigation tracking
- `updateLanguage()`: Change the display language

### Proxy Configuration

For environments with domain blocking concerns, the documentation provides instructions for setting up an AWS CloudFront distribution to reverse proxy both static assets and API traffic.

## Analytics Events

The platform automatically tracks events including:

- **Common Events**: Guide/Survey Viewed, Dismissed, Completed
- **Guide-specific Events**: Guide Engaged, Guide Step Viewed
- **Survey-specific Events**: Survey Submitted, Survey Question Answered

Each event includes properties such as Lifecycle UUID, Guide/Survey ID, Template Type, and Variant ID for comprehensive analytics.
