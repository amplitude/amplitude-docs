## Product Overview

Amplitude's Guides and Surveys SDK is a comprehensive user engagement platform that enables developers to create and deploy interactive user experiences across multiple presentation formats. The SDK provides six distinct form factors - banners, modals, popovers, tooltips, pins, and checklists - each designed for specific user interaction scenarios. The platform includes robust survey functionality with various input types, extensive CSS customization capabilities, and multi-language localization features powered by AI automation.

## Product Relationships and Features

The Guides and Surveys SDK operates as an integrated engagement ecosystem where components work synergistically:

**Form Factor Architecture**: The six presentation formats (banner, modal, popover, tooltip, pin, checklist) share a common underlying framework while providing distinct visual presentations and interaction patterns. Each form factor can be independently styled and configured while maintaining consistent SDK behavior and API interfaces.

**Survey Integration Layer**: Survey capabilities are embedded across all form factors, supporting diverse input types including rating systems, checkboxes, radio buttons, and text inputs. Survey elements maintain consistent functionality regardless of the containing form factor, enabling flexible user experience design.

**Styling and Localization Systems**: Custom CSS styling and localization operate as overlay systems that enhance core engagement functionality. These systems work independently but can be combined to create fully customized, internationalized user experiences without disrupting the underlying SDK architecture.

**Configuration Management**: Settings are managed through a hierarchical system spanning SDK initialization parameters, project-level configurations, and runtime controls, providing flexibility across different implementation scenarios.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Components**:
- **Form Factors**: Six presentation modes (banner, modal, popover, tooltip, pin, checklist) that determine content display and user interaction patterns
- **Engagement Plugin**: Primary SDK component initialized through `engagement.plugin` parameters
- **CSS Class Selectors**: Amplitude-specific styling targets using `amplitude-engagement-` prefixed classes

**Localization Framework**:
- **Locale Parameter**: SDK initialization setting controlling language preference and content resolution
- **Fallback Behavior**: System response mechanism when translations are unavailable or outdated
- **Translatable Strings**: Text elements within guides and surveys eligible for localization
- **XLIFF**: XML Localization Interchange File Format supporting professional translation workflows

**Technical Identifiers**:
- **Container Classes**: `amplitude-engagement-banner-container`, `amplitude-engagement-modal-overlay` for form factor targeting
- **Survey Elements**: Rating inputs, checkbox/radio selectors, CTA button styling classes
- **Locale Codes**: Language resolution parameters for internationalization configuration

**Operational Terms**:
- **Beta Features**: Functionality under active development with potential API changes
- **Plan-Based Access**: Feature availability tied to subscription tiers (Growth/Enterprise)
- **Template System**: Downloadable translation preparation files

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Guides and Surveys SDK integrates deeply into Amplitude's broader analytics and engagement platform:

**Subscription Integration**: Localization functionality requires Growth or Enterprise plans, indicating tight coupling with Amplitude's billing and subscription management systems. This tiered access model suggests the SDK leverages centralized entitlement services.

**Project Management Integration**: Configuration through "Project Settings > Guides and Surveys tab" demonstrates integration with Amplitude's project management infrastructure, enabling centralized administration and team collaboration workflows.

**AI Platform Integration**: Claude AI integration for automated localization indicates connection to Amplitude's AI services layer, providing intelligent translation capabilities that reduce manual localization overhead.

**Multi-Platform Architecture**: Current custom CSS support limited to web SDK implementations suggests a broader multi-platform architecture with web-first feature development and gradual rollout to mobile platforms.

**Analytics Integration**: As part of Amplitude's engagement suite, the SDK likely integrates with core analytics functionality for tracking user interactions, conversion metrics, and engagement performance across different form factors and localization variants.

## Technical Implementation Details

**SDK Initialization**:
- Locale configuration via `engagement.plugin` parameters during SDK setup
- Project-level language support configuration through administrative interface
- Runtime language switching capabilities

**Styling Implementation**:
- CSS class-based targeting using `amplitude-engagement-` prefixed selectors
- Form factor-specific container classes: `amplitude-engagement-banner-container`, `amplitude-engagement-modal-overlay`
- Survey element-specific selectors for granular input customization
- Beta status indicating active development and potential API evolution

**Localization Workflow**:
- Three-method translation approach: web interface editing, AI-powered automation, and XLIFF file upload
- Template download system for translation preparation and professional workflow integration
- Language toggle interface for runtime language switching
- Fallback mechanisms for incomplete or outdated translations

**Development Status**: Both custom CSS styling and certain localization features carry beta designations, indicating active development cycles and potential API changes as features mature toward general availability.

The SDK represents a sophisticated user engagement solution that balances implementation simplicity with extensive customization capabilities, designed to scale across diverse user bases and international markets while maintaining deep integration with Amplitude's comprehensive analytics and engagement ecosystem.
