# Amplitude Guides and Surveys

## Overview

Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product messaging and feedback collection platform that helps product teams improve user experience, drive product adoption, and gather actionable insights. The platform serves as a sophisticated alternative to traditional popup components, enabling teams to deliver contextual assistance, collect targeted feedback, and improve key metrics like retention, activation, and engagement.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Guides
Guides are in-product messages that help users navigate through product features and complete tasks. They use behavioral triggers and rate-limiting mechanisms to provide contextual assistance without disrupting the user experience. Five form factors are available:

- **Modal**: Full-screen overlays for important announcements
- **Popover**: Targeted messages pointing to specific UI elements
- **Pin**: Small indicators that expand when clicked
- **Tooltip**: Contextual help tied to specific UI elements
- **Banner**: Persistent messages at the top or bottom of the screen

### Guide Templates
The platform offers five pre-built guide templates:

1. **Tour**: Step-by-step instructions for product exploration
2. **Announcement**: Single-step messages for important updates
3. **Checklist**: Multi-step guides for completing complex tasks
4. **Banner**: Persistent notifications
5. **Tooltip**: Contextual help for specific UI elements

### Surveys
Surveys enable targeted feedback collection with three available templates:

1. **NPS (Net Promoter Score)**: Measures customer satisfaction and loyalty
2. **User Feedback**: Customizable questions for gathering specific insights
3. **Rating**: Collects initial reactions to product experiences

### Survey Blocks
Surveys can include various question types:
- Rating blocks (Stars, Rating labels, Emoji, NPS)
- Conditional logic for creating dynamic response paths based on user input

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Guides and Surveys product integrates with other Amplitude products and third-party systems through its SDK (`engagement-browser`). The architecture consists of:

1. **SDK Integration**: Can be implemented in three ways:
   - With Amplitude Browser SDK
   - With third-party analytics providers
   - Via Google Tag Manager

2. **Analytics Integration**: Deep integration with Amplitude Analytics, tracking user interactions through:
   - Common event properties (Lifecycle UUID, Guide/Survey ID)
   - Generic events (Viewed, Dismissed, Completed)
   - Guide-specific events (Guide Step Viewed, Guide Step Completed)
   - Survey-specific events (Survey Submitted, Survey Abandoned)

3. **Experimentation Integration**: Works with Amplitude Experiment to enable:
   - A/B testing of different guide/survey variants
   - Multi-armed Bandit experiments for optimization
   - Performance analysis through the Insights dashboard

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Guide-Related Terms
- **Form Factors**: Visual presentation styles (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner)
- **Trigger Conditions**: Rules determining when and where guides appear
- **Display Limits**: Controls for guide frequency
- **Smart Delay**: Automatic timing adjustment to prevent overwhelming users
- **Tiebreaker Rules**: Logic for determining which guide to show when multiple are eligible

### Survey-Related Terms
- **Rating Blocks**: Question types for collecting numerical or categorical feedback
- **Conditional Logic**: Rules that change survey flow based on previous answers
- **NPS**: Net Promoter Score, categorizing users as Promoters, Passives, or Detractors

### Analytics Terms
- **Lifecycle UUID**: Unique identifier for a guide or survey instance
- **Variant ID**: Identifier for experiment variants
- **Rage Close**: When a user dismisses a guide or survey quickly, indicating frustration

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Guides and Surveys integrates with the broader Amplitude ecosystem through:

1. **Analytics Integration**: All interactions are tracked in Amplitude Analytics
2. **Experimentation**: Testing different guide and survey variants
3. **User Profiles**: Targeting based on user properties and behaviors
4. **Microscope Integration**: Drilling down into individual user interactions
5. **Localization**: Enterprise customers can serve content in multiple languages

## Technical Implementation

### SDK Installation
```javascript
// With npm
npm install @amplitude/engagement-browser

// With script tag
<script src="https://cdn.amplitude.com/libs/engagement-browser.umd.min.js"></script>
```

### SDK Initialization
```javascript
// With Amplitude Browser SDK
amplitude.engagement.boot({
  client: amplitude,
  serverUrl: 'https://gs.amplitude.com',
  cdnUrl: 'https://cdn.amplitude.com'
});

// With third-party analytics
amplitude.engagement.boot({
  forwardEvent: function(event) {
    // Forward to your analytics provider
  },
  serverUrl: 'https://gs.amplitude.com',
  cdnUrl: 'https://cdn.amplitude.com'
});
```

### Key SDK Methods
- `boot()`: Initializes the SDK
- `forwardEvent()`: Sends events to trigger guides
- `setThemeMode()`: Controls light/dark mode
- `addCallback()`: Adds custom event handlers
- `setRouter()`: Integrates with single-page applications
- `show()/reset()/closeAll()`: Programmatically controls guides

### Proxy Configuration
For organizations facing domain blocking, a CloudFront distribution can be configured to proxy both static assets and API traffic:
- Origin 1: `cdn.amplitude.com` for static assets
- Origin 2: `gs.amplitude.com` for API traffic

### Permissions Management
The product has its own permission system with five access levels:
1. No Access
2. Viewer (can view published guides/surveys)
3. Member (can create and edit drafts)
4. Manager (can publish guides/surveys)
5. Administrator (full access including permissions management)

## Analysis Capabilities

### Survey Analysis
Two main views for analyzing survey results:
1. **Insights Tab**: Shows aggregate data including NPS breakdown, time-based analysis, and filtering options
2. **Responses Tab**: Displays individual user feedback with sorting and filtering capabilities

### Guide Performance
The Overview tab provides analytics on guide performance:
- Views and completions charts
- Filter cards for segmentation
- Real-time interaction feed
- Rage closes measurement

Through these capabilities, Amplitude Guides and Surveys offers a comprehensive solution for improving user experience, collecting feedback, and driving product adoption through contextual, in-product messaging.
