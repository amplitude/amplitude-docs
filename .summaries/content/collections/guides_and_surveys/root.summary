Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user engagement platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, enabling product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams to improve user retention, activation, and engagement through targeted onboarding experiences and feedback collection.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform operates through two primary engagement mechanisms: **Guides** for user onboarding and feature discovery, and **Surveys** for collecting targeted user feedback. Guides offer five template types (Tour, Announcement, Checklists, Banners, Tooltips) for step-by-step user guidance, while Surveys provide three template types (NPS, User feedback, Rating) for measuring customer satisfaction and gathering insights.

The system delivers content through five distinct **form factors**: Modal (with classic, horizontal split, and vertical split layouts), Popover, Pin (persistent markers with overlay highlighting), Tooltip (hover/click reveal), and Banner (top/bottom positioning with sticky options). Each form factor includes customizable position controls, multi-step functionality, and interactive blocks supporting buttons, images, and videos.

## Technical Integration and SDK

Integration occurs through the **@amplitude/engagement-browser SDK**, which connects with the Amplitude Browser SDK and supports third-party analytics providers including Segment and Google Tag Manager. Key SDK methods include:

- `engagement.init()` for initialization
- `engagement.boot()` for startup  
- `engagement.gs.show()` for display control
- `engagement.gs.reset()` for user history reset
- `engagement.gs.closeAll()` for dismissing all active content

The system supports **proxy configurations** using AWS CloudFront with dual origins (cdn.amplitude.com for static assets and gs.amplitude.com for API requests with /sdk/ prefix routing) to circumvent domain blocking while maintaining performance.

## Targeting and Experimentation Framework

**Setup and Targeting** capabilities include sophisticated user segmentation (All Users vs Targeted Users with segments), multiple trigger conditions (element appearance, time delays, rage clicks, user confusion, event tracking), page targeting with URL pattern matching, and priority levels (Urgent/High/Medium/Low) with display limits and cooldown periods.

The platform integrates with **Amplitude Experiment** for A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, supporting variant configuration, experiment management, exposure event handling, and comprehensive analytics through the insights dashboard.

## Analytics and Measurement Infrastructure

Comprehensive analytics tracking includes **Amplitude analytics events** with properties like Lifecycle UUID, Step ID, Variant ID for A/B testing, and specific events such as Guide Completed, Survey Submitted, and Tooltip Marker Viewed. The **Overview tab** provides real-time metrics including views, completions, rage closes, and interaction feeds with Microscope integration for session replay analysis.

**Survey analysis** features include the Insights tab for aggregate data with NPS scoring (promoters, detractors, passives), type-specific insights, and the Responses tab for individual user response analysis with sorting and filtering capabilities.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Lifecycle UUID**: Unique identifier tracking user journey through guides/surveys
- **Step ID/Step Index**: Navigation tracking within multi-step experiences  
- **Variant ID**: A/B testing experiment variant identification
- **Rage Closes**: Metric measuring user frustration with rapid dismissals
- **Form Factors**: Five display modes (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner)
- **Conditional Logic**: Dynamic response branching for surveys based on user input
- **Microscope Integration**: Session replay functionality for behavioral analysis

## Permissions and Access Control

The platform implements a **three-tier permission system** (Viewer, Member, Manager) that overrides base Amplitude user roles, providing granular access control for viewing, editing drafts, publishing, and running experiments within the module.

## Localization and Internationalization

**Localization support** includes SDK initialization with locale parameters, XLIFF file-based translation workflows, and Project settings for language management, enabling multilingual guide and survey delivery with fallback translation behavior.

## Testing and Customization Capabilities

**Testing capabilities** include preview mode for verifying trigger, limit, and throttle conditions before launch, with troubleshooting tools like Reset User History, Ignore Throttle Limits, and manual event triggering. Live testing supports cohort targeting for production validation.

The **Theme Editor** provides comprehensive customization through Brand controls (accent colors, typography, content colors, borders, backgrounds, form controls) and Component editor for reusable elements, supporting both light and dark modes with Google font library integration.

## Ecosystem Integration

The platform operates within the broader Amplitude ecosystem, leveraging existing user segmentation, analytics infrastructure, and experiment management capabilities while providing specialized tools for in-product user engagement and feedback collection. It seamlessly integrates with Amplitude's core analytics platform, Experiment framework, and user management systems to deliver a unified product experience optimization solution.
