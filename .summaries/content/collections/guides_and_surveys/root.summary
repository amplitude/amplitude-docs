Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user engagement platform that replaces traditional popups with contextual, interactive experiences designed to enhance user onboarding, collect feedback, and improve retention metrics. The platform enables product, growth, and marketing teams to create personalized user experiences directly within their applications.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform operates through three interconnected components:

**Guides** deliver interactive, multi-step user experiences through five distinct form factors: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual bubbles), Pin (persistent markers), Tooltip (hover-triggered help), Banner (notifications), and Checklist (task workflows). Guides utilize sophisticated behavioral triggers including element appearance/clicks, time delays, rage click detection, user confusion analysis, and custom event tracking.

**Surveys** focus on feedback collection through specialized block types: Rating (Stars, NPS, Emoji, Rating labels), Long/Short answer, and List (multiple choice). They support conditional logic for dynamic response branching and provide comprehensive analytics through Insights (aggregate metrics) and Responses (individual data) tabs, with CSV export capabilities up to 10,000 responses.

**Resource Center** functions as an integrated help widget featuring search functionality, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. Its Autopilot system employs semantic search algorithms to automatically generate article recommendations by analyzing page content and surfacing relevant materials from configured repositories.

## Multi-Platform SDK Ecosystem

The platform supports cross-platform deployment through specialized SDKs:

**Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates as an Amplitude Browser SDK plugin, supports third-party analytics (Segment), and includes Google Tag Manager templates. Key methods include `engagement.init()`, `engagement.boot()`, `engagement.forwardEvent()`, and `engagement.gs.show()`.

**iOS SDK** (`Amplitude-Engagement-Swift`) supports Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods, utilizes `AmplitudeEngagement` class initialization, and implements element targeting through `accessibilityIdentifier` and `amplitudeView` modifier for SwiftUI.

**Android SDK** (`amplitude-engagement-android`) integrates with Jetpack Compose using `.amplitudeView` modifier and supports traditional views through `contentDescription` and `tag` properties.

**React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) provides deep linking via `handleURL()` method and plugin booting with user/device ID configuration.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Lifecycle UUID** serves as the primary event grouping mechanism for analytics tracking. **Step ID** and **Step Index** properties monitor user progression through multi-step experiences. **Variant ID** enables A/B testing through Amplitude Experiment integration.

**Targeting** utilizes user segmentation, session properties via `setSessionProperty()`, page targeting with URL patterns, and priority levels (urgent, high, medium, low) with tiebreaker rules for conflict resolution.

**Throttling** controls artifact frequency through configurable limits across time periods (day/week/month/session), with separate settings for guides versus surveys to optimize user experience quality.

**Form Factors** define visual presentation with customization properties including position controls, layout options, z-index management, and interactive elements.

## Advanced Features and Integrations

**Experimentation** integrates with Amplitude Experiment for A/B tests and multi-armed bandit experiments, including variant configuration, exposure event handling, and treatment vs control performance analytics.

**Localization** enables multi-language content through SDK locale configuration, project language settings, fallback behavior, and content translation via web interface, AI localization with Claude, or XLIFF file workflows.

**Personalization** utilizes "Personalize with Variables" to dynamically insert client-side user properties into text blocks with configurable fallback values.

**Analytics Integration** provides comprehensive event tracking including Survey Submitted/Abandoned, Guide Completed/Dismissed, Tooltip Marker Viewed, and Rage Closed events, with Microscope integration for session replay analysis.

## Customization and Theming

**Themes** enable comprehensive branding through the Theme Editor with Brand controls and Component editor sections, supporting accent colors, Google Fonts typography, form controls styling, widget dimensions, CSS properties, and platform-specific themes.

**Custom CSS** (beta, web SDK only) provides CSS class selectors using `amplitude-engagement` classes for advanced styling control of form factors and survey elements.

## Management and Permissions System

The platform implements a five-tier permission system (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) that overrides base Amplitude user roles, providing granular access control for viewing, editing drafts, publishing, and running experiments.

**Templates** create reusable starting points with visibility management and blue banner indicators. **Tags** enable organization through individual or bulk tagging with filtering capabilities for campaign, feature, or team-based categorization.

**Testing and Preview** includes preview mode for condition verification, troubleshooting tools, cohort targeting for live testing, and user history management through Reset User History and Ignore Throttle Limits options.

## Technical Infrastructure

The platform integrates with proxy configurations using AWS CloudFront for unified distributions, supports Content Security Policy (CSP) nonce requirements, and provides API endpoints through the `/sdk/*` path pattern for state persistence and configuration management. The system supports behavioral triggers, smart delays, element interactions, and custom event tracking for sophisticated user experience orchestration.
