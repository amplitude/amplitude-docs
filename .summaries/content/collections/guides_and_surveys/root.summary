Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user engagement platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to enhance user onboarding, collect feedback, and improve retention, activation, and engagement metrics. The platform enables product, growth, and product marketing teams to create contextual, non-intrusive messaging experiences directly within their applications.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of three primary components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** are interactive, multi-step experiences designed for user onboarding and feature exploration. They support six template types (Tour, Announcement, Checklists, Carousel, Banners, Tooltips) and utilize five form factors (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner, and Checklist) with advanced positioning, multi-step configurations, and interactive blocks including buttons, images, and videos.

**Surveys** focus on feedback collection through four unique block types (Rating, Long answer, Short answer, List) with conditional logic for dynamic response branching. Survey templates include NPS, User feedback, Rating, and mobile Carousel formats, supporting various rating types including Stars, NPS, Emoji, and Rating labels.

**Resource Center** provides a searchable widget that integrates external documentation repositories and videos, featuring semantic search functionality, recommendation sets, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. The Resource Center includes an Autopilot feature that automatically generates article recommendations using semantic search to analyze page content.

## Multi-Platform SDK Integration

The platform supports comprehensive cross-platform deployment through dedicated SDKs:

- **Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with Amplitude Browser SDK, third-party analytics providers like Segment, and Google Tag Manager
- **iOS SDK** (`Amplitude-Engagement-Swift`) supports Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods installation with SwiftUI integration
- **Android SDK** (`amplitude-engagement-android`) provides Jetpack Compose support with `.amplitudeView` modifier
- **React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) includes deep linking configuration and URL scheme handling

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Form Factors** define the visual presentation layer with specific positioning and interaction patterns. Each form factor supports customizable properties including z-index, positioning (top right, bottom left, center, auto), content layout, and advanced trigger functionality.

**Targeting and Triggers** control when and to whom content appears. The system supports behavioral triggers including element appearance/clicks, time delays, smart delay, rage click detection, user confusion patterns, and custom event tracking. Targeting utilizes CSS Selector and XPath targeting with session properties and page targeting rules.

**Analytics Schema** employs a comprehensive event tracking system with all events prefixed `[Guides-Surveys]` in Amplitude. Common properties include App Type, Lifecycle UUID, Step ID, Variant ID, and Source.type (nudge, trigger, sdk, share_link). Specific events track Guide Viewed/Completed/Dismissed and Survey Submitted/Abandoned/Response interactions.

**Throttling and Rate Limiting** manages artifact appearance frequency through configurable limits across time periods (day/week/month/session), with separate settings for guides versus surveys to optimize user experience.

## Advanced Features and Customization

**Experimentation** integrates with Amplitude Experiment to support A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, including variant configuration, exposure event handling, and insights dashboard analytics.

**Localization** enables multi-language content delivery through SDK locale configuration, project language settings, fallback behavior, and content translation via web interface, AI localization with Claude, or XLIFF file upload.

**Theming** provides comprehensive branding customization through the Theme Editor, controlling colors, typography (Google fonts), form controls, widget dimensions, animations, and platform-specific styling for web and mobile.

**Custom CSS** (beta, web SDK only) allows advanced styling through CSS class selectors targeting form factor containers and survey elements with `amplitude-engagement` CSS classes.

**Personalization** supports dynamic content insertion using client-side user properties with fallback values when properties are unavailable.

## Analytics and Insights

The platform provides comprehensive analytics through multiple interfaces:

- **Overview Dashboard** displays views/completions over time, rage closes percentage, and real-time interactions feed with Microscope integration
- **Insights Tab** offers aggregate metrics and trends with NPS-specific breakdowns and time-based analysis (hourly/daily/weekly/monthly/quarterly)
- **Responses Tab** provides individual user response data with CSV export capabilities up to 10k responses

## Permission System and Management

A three-tier permission system (Viewer, Member, Manager) overrides base Amplitude user roles, providing granular access control for viewing, editing drafts, publishing, and running experiments. The system supports per-project role assignment through the Guides and Surveys > Permissions interface.

## API Endpoints and Technical Integration

Key technical endpoints include:
- `/sdk/*` path pattern for API routing through proxy configurations
- `engagement.init()` and `engagement.boot()` for SDK initialization
- `engagement.gs.show()` and `engagement.gs.reset()` for programmatic control
- `handlePreviewLinkIntent()` and `handleURL()` for preview mode and deep linking
- `forwardEvent()` for third-party analytics integration

The platform supports proxy configurations through AWS CloudFront with specific cache behaviors for `cdn.amplitude.com` (static assets) and `gs.amplitude.com` (API requests), enabling enterprise deployment scenarios with unified distributions and custom serverUrl/cdnUrl configurations.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Guides and Surveys operates as a core component within the broader Amplitude Digital Analytics Platform, integrating seamlessly with Amplitude Analytics for user behavior tracking, Amplitude Experiment for A/B testing capabilities, and the Amplitude CDP for unified customer data management. The platform leverages Amplitude's existing user segmentation, cohort analysis, and behavioral analytics to deliver highly targeted in-product experiences, while feeding engagement data back into the analytics ecosystem for comprehensive user journey analysis and optimization.
