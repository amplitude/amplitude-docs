Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user engagement platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to enhance user onboarding, collect feedback, and improve retention, activation, and engagement metrics. The platform enables product, growth, and product marketing teams to create contextual, interactive experiences directly within their applications.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of three primary components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** are interactive, multi-step experiences designed for user onboarding, feature announcements, and task completion guidance. They support five distinct form factors: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual bubbles), Pin (persistent markers), Tooltip (hover-triggered help), Banner (page-wide notifications), and Checklist (task-oriented workflows). Guides utilize behavioral triggers including element appearance/clicks, time delays, rage clicks, user confusion detection, and custom event tracking.

**Surveys** focus on feedback collection through four specialized block types: Rating (Stars, NPS, Emoji, Rating labels), Long answer, Short answer, and List (multiple choice). Surveys support conditional logic for dynamic response branching and utilize a subset of guide form factors (modal, popover, pin). The platform provides comprehensive analytics through the Insights tab for aggregate metrics and the Responses tab for individual user data, with CSV export capabilities up to 10,000 responses.

**Resource Center** functions as a help widget that integrates with the Guides and Surveys SDK, providing search functionality, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. It features an Autopilot system that uses semantic search algorithms to automatically generate article recommendations by analyzing page content and surfacing relevant articles from content repositories.

## Multi-Platform SDK Implementation

The platform supports comprehensive cross-platform deployment through dedicated SDKs:

**Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with Amplitude Browser SDK, third-party analytics providers like Segment, and Google Tag Manager. Key methods include `engagement.init()`, `engagement.boot()`, `engagement.forwardEvent()`, and `engagement.gs.show()` for programmatic control.

**Android SDK** (`amplitude-engagement-android`) supports Jetpack Compose through `.amplitudeView` modifier and traditional Android views using `contentDescription`/`tag` properties for element targeting. The `AmplitudeEngagement` class handles initialization and screen tracking.

**iOS SDK** (`AmplitudeEngagementSwift`) integrates as an iOS Swift SDK plugin, utilizing `accessibilityIdentifier` for element targeting and supporting Swift Package Manager/CocoaPods installation.

**React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) provides deep linking support via `handleURL()` method and plugin booting with user/device ID configuration.

## Advanced Targeting and Personalization

The platform employs sophisticated targeting mechanisms including user segmentation, session properties via `setSessionProperty()`, page targeting with URL matching patterns, and priority levels (urgent, high, medium, low). The system supports rollout percentage bucketing, display limits with cooldown periods, and active state management with tiebreaker rules.

**Personalization** is achieved through the "Personalize with Variables" feature, which dynamically inserts client-side user properties into guide and survey text blocks with configurable fallback values. The platform supports comprehensive localization through SDK locale configuration, XLIFF file translation workflows, and AI-powered localization using Claude.

## Analytics and Experimentation

The analytics framework tracks comprehensive event properties including Lifecycle UUID for event grouping, Step ID and Step Index for navigation tracking, and Variant ID for A/B testing. Key events include Survey Submitted, Survey Abandoned, Guide Completed, Guide Dismissed, Tooltip Marker Viewed, and Rage Closed detection.

**Amplitude Experiment integration** enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, with variant configuration, exposure event handling, and insights dashboard analytics for treatment vs control performance tracking.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Form Factors**: The visual presentation modes (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner, Checklist) that determine how guides and surveys appear to users.

**Lifecycle UUID**: A unique identifier that groups related events within a single guide or survey interaction session.

**Strike Detection**: A mechanism that tracks user interaction patterns to prevent over-engagement.

**Rate Limiting/Throttling**: Configurable controls that manage the frequency and timing of guide/survey appearances across different time periods (day/week/month/session).

**Recommendation Sets**: Customizable collections of articles and information for the Resource Center that can be embedded as personalized landing pages.

**Autopilot**: An intelligent recommendation system that uses semantic search to automatically surface relevant content based on page analysis.

## Enterprise Features and Management

The platform includes a comprehensive permission system with five access levels (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) that override base Amplitude user roles. The **Templates** system enables creation of reusable starting points for guides and surveys with visibility management and theme inheritance.

**Themes** provide extensive customization capabilities through the Theme Editor, including Brand controls for colors and typography, Component editor for form controls and widget dimensions, and platform-specific theme configurations for web and mobile.

**Proxy Configuration** supports AWS CloudFront setup with specific cache behaviors for the critical `/sdk/*` path pattern, enabling enterprise-grade deployment with proper API routing and static asset delivery.

The platform integrates seamlessly with the broader Amplitude ecosystem, leveraging existing user properties, event tracking, and analytics infrastructure while providing specialized engagement and feedback collection capabilities that complement core product analytics workflows.
