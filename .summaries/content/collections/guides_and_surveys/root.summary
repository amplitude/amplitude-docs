Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user engagement platform designed to replace traditional popups with seamless, contextual user experiences. The platform enables product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams to improve user onboarding, collect targeted feedback, and enhance key metrics including retention, activation, and engagement through sophisticated in-app messaging and survey capabilities.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform operates through three interconnected components that deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** function as interactive in-product experiences that facilitate user navigation and feature understanding. They support five distinct form factors (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner) and include pre-built templates for Tours, Announcements, Checklists, Banners, and Tooltips. Guides incorporate behavioral triggers, strike detection mechanisms, and rate-limiting controls to optimize user experience delivery.

**Surveys** enable targeted feedback collection through four specialized block types: Rating blocks (Stars, NPS, Emoji, Rating labels), Long answer blocks, Short answer blocks, and List blocks. Surveys leverage conditional logic for dynamic response pathways and utilize a subset of guide form factors (modal, popover, pin) for deployment.

**Resource Center** operates as an integrated help widget that connects with the SDK to provide search functionality, recommended content curation, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. The Resource Center features Autopilot functionality utilizing semantic search to automatically surface relevant articles from connected documentation repositories.

## SDK Integration and Multi-Platform Support

The platform provides extensive SDK support across multiple development environments:

**Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with Amplitude Browser SDK, third-party analytics providers including Segment, and Google Tag Manager for comprehensive web application support.

**iOS SDK** supports Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods installation methodologies with SwiftUI integration through the `amplitudeView` modifier for native iOS development.

**Android SDK** supports Jetpack Compose through the `.amplitudeView` modifier and traditional Android views via `contentDescription` targeting mechanisms.

**React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) includes deep linking support for cross-platform mobile development.

Critical SDK methods include `engagement.init()` for initialization, `engagement.boot()` for activation, `engagement.forwardEvent()` for event handling, and platform-specific targeting mechanisms using `accessibilityIdentifier` (iOS) and element targeting properties.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Form Factors** define the visual presentation methodology for guides and surveys: Modal (overlay dialog interfaces), Popover (contextual bubble presentations), Pin (persistent interface elements), Tooltip (marker-based contextual hints), Banner (full-width notification displays), and Checklist (task-oriented interface structures).

**Targeting and Triggers** control content delivery timing and audience selection. Targeting supports "All Users" versus "Targeted Users" configurations with segment-based filtering, rollout percentage controls, and bucketing unit specifications. Trigger mechanisms include immediate activation, element-based triggers, time delays, smart delay algorithms, rage click detection, user confusion indicators, and event-based activation protocols.

**Analytics Events** are tracked through Amplitude's analytics infrastructure with specific properties including Lifecycle UUID, Step ID, Variant ID for A/B testing scenarios, and comprehensive event tracking for Guide Engaged/Completed/Dismissed and Survey Submitted/Abandoned/Completed interactions.

**Throttling** manages the rate and frequency of guide and survey appearances through configurable limits and time period specifications (day/week/month/session-based controls).

## Advanced Platform Capabilities

**Experimentation** integrates with Amplitude Experiment to support A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, including variant configuration management, exposure event handling, and insights dashboard analytics for performance optimization.

**Localization** enables multi-language content delivery through SDK locale configuration, project language settings, fallback behavior protocols, and content translation via web interface, AI-powered localization, or XLIFF file upload processes.

**Personalization** utilizes the "Personalize with Variables" feature to dynamically insert client-side user properties into text blocks with configurable fallback values when user properties are unavailable.

**Themes** provide comprehensive branding customization including color schemes, typography controls, form control styling, card presentations, widget dimensions, and animation behaviors through a Theme Editor featuring Brand controls and Component editor sections.

## Analytics and Performance Analysis

The platform delivers robust analytics through multiple analytical interfaces:

**Overview Dashboard** displays comprehensive performance metrics including view counts, completion rates, rage close incidents, and real-time interaction monitoring.

**Survey Analysis** includes an Insights tab for aggregate metrics and NPS breakdowns, plus a Responses tab for individual user data analysis with CSV export capabilities supporting up to 10,000 responses.

**Microscope Integration** enables session replay analysis of user interactions for detailed behavioral understanding.

## Permission System and Access Management

The platform implements a five-tier permission system (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) that overrides base Amplitude user roles to provide granular access control for viewing capabilities, draft editing, publishing permissions, and experiment execution within the Guides and Surveys module.

**Templates** enable creation of reusable starting configurations for guides and surveys with visibility management controls and automatic "Template" suffix naming conventions for organizational clarity.

**Tags** provide organizational capabilities for guides and surveys with bulk operation support, filtering mechanisms, and management through the list view interface.

## Technical Configuration and Infrastructure

**Proxy Setup** supports AWS CloudFront configuration as a reverse proxy with specific origins (cdn.amplitude.com for static asset delivery, gs.amplitude.com for API request handling) and critical `/sdk/*` path patterns for API routing functionality.

**Testing and Preview** includes preview mode capabilities for verifying conditions and settings before launch, with integrated troubleshooting capabilities and live testing using cohort targeting methodologies.

The platform integrates comprehensively with the broader Amplitude ecosystem, leveraging existing user segmentation infrastructure, analytics capabilities, and experimentation frameworks while providing specialized tools for in-product user engagement and feedback collection that enhance the overall product analytics and optimization workflow.
