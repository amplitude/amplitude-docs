Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to improve user onboarding, engagement, and feedback collection. The platform enables product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams to create contextual, interactive experiences that drive retention, activation, and engagement metrics through targeted guides and surveys deployed directly within applications.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The platform consists of several interconnected components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Core Components:**
- **Guides**: Interactive in-product experiences including Tours, Announcements, Checklists, Banners, and Tooltips that guide users through features and workflows
- **Surveys**: Feedback collection tools with specialized block types (Rating, Long answer, Short answer, List) supporting conditional logic and branching
- **Resource Center**: A searchable widget that surfaces relevant documentation, articles, and support content using semantic search and recommendation sets
- **Analytics Engine**: Comprehensive tracking and analysis capabilities integrated with Amplitude's analytics platform

**Form Factors and Templates:**
The system supports five primary form factors (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner, and Checklist) that can be customized with various interactive elements including buttons, images, videos, and multi-step navigation. Templates provide pre-configured starting points for common use cases like user onboarding tours, feature announcements, NPS surveys, and feedback collection.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Targeting and Triggers:**
- **Behavioral Triggers**: Event-based activation including element interactions, time delays, smart delay, rage clicks, and user confusion detection
- **Strike Detection**: System for identifying user interaction patterns that indicate confusion or frustration
- **Rate-limiting/Throttling**: Controls for managing guide and survey frequency per user across different time periods (session, day, week, month)
- **Bucketing Units**: User segmentation mechanism for A/B testing and rollout control

**Analytics Properties:**
- **Lifecycle UUID**: Unique identifier tracking user journey through guides/surveys
- **Step ID/Step Index**: Navigation tracking within multi-step experiences  
- **Variant ID**: A/B testing variant identification for experiments
- **Rage Closed**: Event tracking when users forcefully dismiss guides/surveys

**Content Management:**
- **Recommendation Sets**: Curated content collections for Resource Center with priority-based display logic
- **Autopilot**: Automated content recommendation system using semantic search algorithms
- **Localization**: Multi-language support with XLIFF workflows and AI-powered translation via Claude

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Guides and Surveys integrates deeply with the broader Amplitude ecosystem and external platforms:

**Amplitude Integration:**
- Native integration with Amplitude Analytics for event tracking and user segmentation
- Amplitude Experiment integration for A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments
- Microscope integration for session replay analysis
- Cohort targeting using Amplitude user segments

**Third-Party Integrations:**
- Segment analytics provider support via `forwardEvent()` method
- Google Tag Manager template for deployment
- AWS CloudFront proxy configuration for enterprise deployments
- Third-party chat module integration within Resource Center

**Multi-Platform SDK Support:**
- Web SDK (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) with CSP nonce support
- iOS SDK with Swift Package Manager/CocoaPods installation
- Android SDK with Jetpack Compose support via `.amplitudeView` modifier
- React Native SDK (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) with deep linking

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Core SDK Methods:**
- `engagement.init(apiKey, options)` - Initialize the SDK with configuration
- `engagement.boot(userOptions)` - Boot with user/device identification
- `engagement.gs.show(guideKey)` - Programmatically display specific guides
- `engagement.gs.reset(stepIndex)` - Reset guide state and navigation
- `engagement.forwardEvent(eventType, properties)` - Send events for trigger conditions
- `engagement.setSessionProperty(key, value)` - Set session-level targeting properties
- `engagement.updateLanguage(locale)` - Dynamic language switching

**Mobile SDK Targeting:**
- iOS: `accessibilityIdentifier` for element targeting with `amplitudeView` SwiftUI modifier
- Android: `contentDescription` and tag properties for element identification in Jetpack Compose

**Preview and Testing:**
- Preview mode with custom URL schemes for mobile testing
- `handlePreviewLinkIntent()` (Android) and `handleUrl()` (iOS) for deep link handling
- Debug mode filtering to exclude internal testing from analytics

**Resource Center API Patterns:**
- `/sdk/*` path pattern for API routing through proxy configurations
- Website scraper with URL extraction via CSV/XML sitemap uploads
- Content selector overrides using CSS selectors and XPath targeting

The platform includes comprehensive permission management with five access levels (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) that override base Amplitude user roles, providing granular control over guide/survey creation, editing, publishing, and experiment execution capabilities.
