Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that replaces traditional popups with contextual, targeted experiences designed to improve user retention, activation, and engagement. The platform serves product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams by enabling them to create sophisticated onboarding flows and collect user feedback directly within their applications.

## Core Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The platform operates through three interconnected components that form a cohesive user experience ecosystem:

**Guides** serve as the primary engagement mechanism, offering five distinct form factors: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual bubbles), Pin (persistent elements), Tooltip (hover information), and Banner (notification bars). These guides support multi-step navigation with advanced triggering capabilities and interactive content blocks including buttons, images, and videos. Template categories include Tours for onboarding, Announcements for feature releases, Checklists for task completion, Banners for notifications, and Tooltips for contextual help.

**Surveys** leverage the same underlying infrastructure as guides but focus specifically on feedback collection through specialized block types: Rating (Stars, NPS, Emoji, Rating labels), Long answer, Short answer, and List blocks. Surveys utilize conditional logic for dynamic response paths and employ a subset of guide form factors (modal, popover, pin). Common implementations include NPS surveys, user feedback collection, and rating surveys for customer satisfaction measurement.

**Resource Center** functions as an intelligent help widget that integrates search functionality, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. It automatically surfaces relevant articles from external documentation repositories using semantic search through the Autopilot feature, creating a smart fallback system when manual recommendation sets aren't configured.

## Technical Implementation and SDK Architecture

The platform provides comprehensive SDK support across multiple environments:

**Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with the Amplitude Browser SDK and supports third-party analytics providers including Segment and Google Tag Manager. Core methods include:
- `engagement.init()` for initialization
- `engagement.boot()` for activation
- `engagement.gs.show()` for manual triggering
- `engagement.gs.reset()` for user state management
- `engagement.setRouter()` for SPA routing support
- `engagement.updateLanguage()` for localization

**Mobile SDKs** are available for iOS (AmplitudeEngagement), Android (amplitude-engagement-android), and React Native (@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native). Mobile implementations support screen tracking, element targeting through accessibilityIdentifier, and preview mode configuration with custom URL schemes.

**API Integration** utilizes dual endpoints: `cdn.amplitude.com` for static assets and `gs.amplitude.com` for API requests with `/sdk/` prefix routing. The platform supports proxy configuration through AWS CloudFront for circumventing domain blocking while maintaining performance.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Lifecycle UUID** serves as the primary identifier for tracking user interactions across all experiences. **Step ID** and **Step Index** track progression through multi-step flows, while **Variant ID** enables A/B testing functionality.

**Behavioral Triggers** encompass element appearance/clicks, time delays, smart delay, rage click detection, and user confusion patterns. **Strike Detection** and **Rate-limiting Mechanisms** prevent over-exposure and user fatigue through sophisticated throttling.

**Targeting Configuration** supports user segmentation through "All Users" vs "Targeted Users" with rollout percentages, cohort filtering, and bucketing units. **Page Targeting Rules** utilize URL matching (contains, regex) and CSS Selector/XPath targeting for precise element identification.

**Priority Levels** (Urgent, High, Medium, Low) determine display precedence when multiple experiences are eligible, with **Tiebreaker Logic** resolving conflicts. **Display Limits** and **Cooldown Periods** control frequency and timing of experience delivery.

## Analytics and Experimentation Framework

The platform provides comprehensive analytics through **Amplitude Event Tracking** with specific events including Guide Engaged, Guide Step Completed, Survey Submitted, Survey Abandoned, and Tooltip Marker Viewed. The **Insights Tab** offers aggregate metrics and trends with NPS-specific breakdowns and Microscope integration for session replays.

**Amplitude Experiment Integration** enables sophisticated A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, with variant configuration, exposure event handling, and performance analytics. Experiments support treatment vs control groups with configurable rollout percentages and real-time performance monitoring.

**Survey Analysis** includes the Responses tab for individual user response data with CSV export functionality and advanced filtering capabilities. Time-based analysis supports hourly, daily, and weekly engagement trend tracking with cohort-based segmentation.

## Localization and Customization Capabilities

**Localization Support** includes SDK initialization with locale parameters, project-level language management, and three translation methods: web interface editing, AI-powered translation using Claude, and XLIFF file workflow integration. The system supports translation fallback behavior and automatic locale code resolution.

**Themes and Branding** enable comprehensive customization through the Theme Editor with Brand controls and Component editor sections. Customizable elements include accent colors, Google Fonts typography, form controls styling, widget dimensions, CSS properties, animation settings, and platform-specific themes for web and mobile environments.

## Content Management and Resource Center Integration

**Resource Center Content Management** supports multiple source types including documentation repositories and video content with automated sync options and granular visibility settings. The **Website Scraper** feature enables URL extraction through direct URLs or CSV/XML sitemap upload, with advanced filtering options and content selector overrides.

**Recommendation Sets** create customizable in-context articles with various action types including visit link, click element, run callback, open third-party chat, show guide/survey, open article, and play video. **Autopilot** automatically generates content recommendations using semantic search to surface relevant articles based on current page context and user behavior patterns.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Guides and Surveys integrates seamlessly with the broader Amplitude ecosystem, leveraging existing user data, cohorts, and analytics infrastructure. The platform extends Amplitude's core analytics capabilities by providing actionable engagement tools that can respond to behavioral insights in real-time.

The **Three-tier Permission System** (Viewer, Member, Manager/Administrator) overrides base Amplitude user roles, providing specialized access control for viewing, editing drafts, publishing, and running experiments within the Guides and Surveys module.

**Preview Mode** and **Live Testing** capabilities utilize cohort targeting for real-world validation, while the **Test & Preview** interface provides condition status indicators and comprehensive debugging tools including Reset User History, Ignore Throttle Limits, and manual event triggering.

The platform represents a comprehensive solution for in-product user experience optimization, transforming traditional static documentation and support flows into dynamic, contextual experiences that adapt to user behavior and drive measurable engagement outcomes.
