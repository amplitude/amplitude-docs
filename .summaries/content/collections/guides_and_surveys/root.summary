Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that replaces traditional popups with sophisticated interactive guidance and feedback collection systems. The platform enables product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams to create personalized user experiences that improve onboarding, engagement, and retention metrics throughout the customer journey.

## Product Architecture and Core Components

The platform operates through three interconnected components that deliver cohesive user experiences:

**Guides** serve as the primary engagement mechanism, offering five distinct form factors: Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner, and Checklist. These guides support multi-step navigation with advanced triggering capabilities and interactive content blocks including buttons, images, and videos. Template categories include Tours for step-by-step instruction sequences, Announcements for feature highlights, Checklists for task completion tracking, Banners for persistent messaging, and Tooltips for contextual assistance.

**Surveys** provide targeted feedback collection through four specialized block types: Rating blocks (Stars, NPS, Emoji, Rating labels), Long answer, Short answer, and List blocks. The survey system implements conditional logic for dynamic response pathways and utilizes modal, popover, and pin form factors. Primary survey templates encompass NPS measurement, user feedback collection, and rating surveys for customer satisfaction tracking.

**Resource Center** functions as an integrated help widget that connects with the Guides and Surveys SDK, featuring search functionality, content recommendations, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. The Autopilot feature leverages semantic search algorithms to automatically generate content recommendations from external documentation repositories.

## Technical Implementation and SDK Integration

The platform deploys through dedicated SDKs across multiple environments: Web (@amplitude/engagement-browser), iOS (AmplitudeEngagement), Android (amplitude-engagement-android), and React Native (@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native). Core initialization follows the pattern of `engagement.init()` and `engagement.boot()` methods with configuration parameters for user identification, theme management, and event forwarding.

Integration extends to third-party analytics providers including Segment, Google Tag Manager, and native Amplitude Analytics. Proxy configurations operate through AWS CloudFront with specific origins: cdn.amplitude.com for static assets and gs.amplitude.com for API requests, utilizing critical `/sdk/*` path patterns for API routing.

## Targeting and Personalization Framework

The targeting system employs sophisticated segmentation mechanisms including user categorization (All Users vs Targeted Users), rollout percentage controls with bucketing units, and cohort-based filtering. Trigger mechanisms encompass element appearance/click detection, time-based delays, smart delay algorithms, rage click detection, user confusion pattern recognition, and event-based tracking through CSS Selector and XPath targeting methodologies.

Page targeting utilizes URL matching patterns (contains, matches, regex) while priority hierarchies (Urgent, High, Medium, Low) manage display precedence. The system implements display frequency limits, cooldown periods, and active state management with tiebreaker logic for handling multiple concurrent eligible experiences.

## Analytics and Experimentation Capabilities

Amplitude Experiment integration enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experimentation on guides and surveys through variant configuration and exposure event handling. The analytics framework captures comprehensive event properties including Lifecycle UUID, Step ID, Variant ID for experimentation, and specific behavioral events such as Guide Engaged, Guide Step Completed, Survey Submitted, and Survey Abandoned.

Analysis functionality includes the Insights tab for aggregate metrics and trend analysis with NPS-specific breakdowns, Microscope integration for session replay analysis, and the Responses tab for individual user response data with CSV export capabilities and advanced filtering options.

## Content Management and Localization

Content management operates through template systems that provide reusable starting points, organizational tag structures, and brand customization themes. The Theme Editor offers Brand controls and Component editor sections for customizing visual elements including colors, typography, form controls, cards, widget dimensions, and animation behaviors.

Localization support includes SDK locale initialization, project-level language management settings, and three translation methodologies: direct web interface editing, AI-powered translation using Claude, and XLIFF file workflow integration with translation fallback mechanisms.

## Permission Architecture and Testing Framework

A five-tier permission system (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) provides granular access control that overrides base user roles, managing capabilities for viewing, draft editing, publishing, and experiment execution. Project-level permission management operates through the Guides and Surveys > Permissions interface.

Testing capabilities include preview mode for validating trigger, limit, and throttle conditions pre-launch, with troubleshooting tools such as Reset User History, Ignore Throttle Limits, and manual event triggering. Live testing utilizes cohort targeting for real-world validation scenarios.

## Key API Endpoints and Technical Methods

Critical technical endpoints include `/sdk/admin/config` for preview mode configuration and essential SDK methods: `engagement.gs.show()` for manual display triggering, `engagement.gs.reset()` for user state management, `engagement.forwardEvent()` for analytics integration, `engagement.setRouter()` for single-page application routing, and `engagement.updateLanguage()` for dynamic localization.

Mobile implementations utilize platform-specific methods including `AmplitudeEngagement.boot()` for iOS initialization and `getPlugin().handleURL()` for React Native deep linking functionality. The platform supports Content Security Policy (CSP) nonce configuration, serverZone selection (US/EU), and comprehensive callback registration through `engagement.addCallback()` for custom instrumentation and integration workflows.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Within the broader Amplitude ecosystem, Guides and Surveys functions as the engagement and feedback layer that complements Amplitude Analytics for behavioral tracking and Amplitude Experiment for testing frameworks. The platform serves as the execution mechanism for insights derived from analytics data, enabling teams to act on user behavior patterns through targeted interventions and feedback collection, creating a closed-loop system for product optimization and user experience enhancement.
