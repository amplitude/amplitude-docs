Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to improve user retention, activation, and engagement through targeted onboarding experiences and feedback collection. The platform enables product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams to create contextual user guidance and gather insights directly within their applications.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of three primary components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** provide interactive in-product guidance through five distinct form factors: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual bubbles), Pin (persistent elements), Tooltip (hover information), Banner (notification bars), and Checklist (task lists). These guides support multi-step navigation, advanced triggers, and various interactive blocks including buttons, images, and videos. Available templates include Tours for step-by-step onboarding, Announcements for feature releases, Checklists for task completion, Banners for notifications, and Tooltips for contextual help.

**Surveys** enable targeted feedback collection through four unique block types: Rating (Stars, NPS, Emoji, Rating labels), Long answer, Short answer, and List blocks. Surveys support conditional logic for dynamic response paths and utilize a subset of guide form factors (modal, popover, pin). Survey templates include NPS surveys, User feedback collection, and Rating surveys for measuring customer satisfaction.

**Resource Center** functions as a help widget that integrates search functionality, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. It automatically surfaces relevant articles from external documentation repositories using semantic search through the Autopilot feature, serving as a smart fallback when manual recommendation sets aren't configured.

## Technical Implementation and SDKs

The platform provides comprehensive SDK support across multiple platforms:

**Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with the Amplitude Browser SDK and supports third-party analytics providers including Segment and Google Tag Manager. Key methods include `engagement.init()`, `engagement.boot()`, `engagement.gs.show()`, and `engagement.gs.reset()`. The SDK supports SPA routing through `engagement.setRouter()`, theme management via `ThemeMode`, and localization through `engagement.updateLanguage()`.

**Mobile SDKs** are available for iOS (AmplitudeEngagement with Swift Package Manager/CocoaPods), Android (amplitude-engagement-android with Kotlin 1.8.22), and React Native (@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native). Mobile implementations support screen tracking, element targeting through accessibilityIdentifier, and preview mode configuration with custom URL schemes.

**API Integration** utilizes dual endpoints: `cdn.amplitude.com` for static assets and `gs.amplitude.com` for API requests with `/sdk/` prefix routing. The platform supports proxy configuration through AWS CloudFront for circumventing domain blocking while maintaining low latency.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Lifecycle UUID** serves as the primary identifier for tracking user interactions across guide and survey experiences. **Step ID** and **Step Index** track progression through multi-step experiences, while **Variant ID** enables A/B testing functionality.

**Behavioral Triggers** include element appearance/clicks, time delays, smart delay, rage click detection, and user confusion patterns. **Strike Detection** and **Rate-limiting Mechanisms** prevent over-exposure and user fatigue.

**Targeting Configuration** supports user segmentation through "All Users" vs "Targeted Users" with rollout percentages, cohort filtering, and bucketing units. **Page Targeting Rules** utilize URL matching (contains, regex) and CSS Selector/XPath targeting for precise element identification.

**Priority Levels** (Urgent, High, Medium, Low) determine display precedence when multiple experiences are eligible, with **Tiebreaker Logic** resolving conflicts. **Display Limits** and **Cooldown Periods** control frequency and timing.

## Analytics and Experimentation

The platform provides comprehensive analytics through **Amplitude Event Tracking** with specific events including Guide Engaged, Guide Step Completed, Survey Submitted, Survey Abandoned, and Tooltip Marker Viewed. **Rage Closed Events** track user frustration patterns.

**Amplitude Experiment Integration** enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, with variant configuration, exposure event handling, and insights dashboard analytics. The **Insights Tab** provides aggregate metrics and trends with NPS-specific breakdowns and Microscope integration for session replays.

**Survey Analysis** includes the Responses tab for individual user response data with CSV export functionality and filtering capabilities. Time-based analysis supports hourly, daily, and weekly engagement trend tracking.

## Localization and Customization

**Localization Support** includes SDK initialization with locale parameters, Project settings for language management, and three translation methods: web interface editing, AI-powered translation using Claude, and XLIFF file workflow integration. The system supports translation fallback behavior and locale code language resolution.

**Themes and Branding** enable comprehensive customization through the Theme Editor with Brand controls and Component editor sections. Customizable elements include accent colors, Google Fonts typography, form controls styling, widget dimensions, CSS properties, animation settings, and platform-specific themes for web and mobile.

## Permissions and Access Control

The platform implements a **Three-tier Permission System** that overrides base Amplitude user roles: Viewer (read-only access), Member (draft editing), and Manager (publishing and experiments). **Role-based Access Control** provides granular permissions for viewing, editing drafts, publishing, and running experiments within the Guides and Surveys module.

## Content Management and Resource Center

**Resource Center Content Management** supports documentation repositories and video sources with sync options, draft/published visibility states, and Website scraper functionality for URL extraction through direct URLs or CSV/XML sitemap upload. **Recommendation Sets** create customizable in-time articles with various action types including visit link, click element, run callback, open third-party chat, show guide/survey, open article, and play video.

**Content Targeting** operates through precedence rules between content source targeting and recommendation set targeting, with segment-based and page-specific targeting configuration supporting priority levels and targeted user segments.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Guides and Surveys integrates deeply within the broader Amplitude ecosystem, leveraging Amplitude Analytics for user segmentation and behavioral data, Amplitude Experiment for A/B testing capabilities, and Amplitude Microscope for session replay analysis. The platform extends Amplitude's core analytics capabilities by providing actionable engagement tools that can respond to user behavior patterns identified through Amplitude's analytics platform, creating a comprehensive product intelligence and engagement solution.
