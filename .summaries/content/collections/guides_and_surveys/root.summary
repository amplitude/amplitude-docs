# Amplitude Guides and Surveys

## Product Overview

Amplitude Guides and Surveys is an in-product messaging and feedback collection platform that enables companies to deliver contextual communications and gather user feedback directly within their applications. The platform helps improve user experience, facilitate product learning, collect user feedback, and enhance key metrics like retention, activation, and engagement.

The product consists of two primary components:

1. **Guides**: In-product messages triggered by user behavior that help users complete tasks or explore features. Available in five form factors (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, and Banner) and five templates (Tour, Announcement, Checklist, Banner, and Tooltip).

2. **Surveys**: Targeted feedback collection tools with templates including NPS (Net Promoter Score), User Feedback, and Rating surveys to measure customer satisfaction and gather product experience insights.

The platform serves as a more contextual and less disruptive alternative to traditional popup components, designed for cross-functional use by product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams.
