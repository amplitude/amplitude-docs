# Amplitude Guides and Surveys

## Overview

Amplitude Guides and Surveys is an in-product messaging and feedback collection platform that helps product teams improve user experience, drive product adoption, and gather actionable insights. The platform replaces traditional popup components with contextually relevant guides and targeted surveys that can be triggered based on user behavior.

The product serves three primary use cases:
- Guiding users through product features and workflows
- Collecting targeted feedback at key moments in the user journey
- Improving key metrics like retention, activation, and engagement

## Product Relationships and Features

### Guides

Guides are in-product messages delivered in five form factors:
- **Modal**: Full-screen overlays for important announcements
- **Popover**: Targeted messages pointing to specific UI elements
- **Pin**: Small indicators that expand when clicked
- **Tooltip**: Contextual help tied to specific UI elements
- **Banner**: Persistent messages at screen edges

These form factors are organized into five pre-built templates:
- **Tour**: Multi-step instructions for product exploration
- **Announcement**: Single-step messages for important updates
- **Checklist**: Task-oriented guides for feature adoption
- **Banner**: Persistent notifications
- **Tooltip**: Contextual help for specific UI elements

### Surveys

Surveys enable targeted feedback collection through three template types:
- **NPS (Net Promoter Score)**: Measures customer satisfaction and loyalty
- **User Feedback**: Customizable questions for specific insights
- **Rating**: Gathers initial reactions to product experiences

Surveys support various question types (rating blocks, stars, emoji, NPS) and can implement conditional logic to create dynamic response paths based on user input.

### Integration Architecture

The platform is delivered through the Guides and Surveys SDK, which can be integrated via:
1. Amplitude Browser SDK
2. Third-party analytics providers
3. Google Tag Manager

The SDK connects with Amplitude's analytics platform to track guide and survey interactions, enabling performance analysis through the Overview tab and Microscope integration for detailed user journey analysis.

### Experimentation Integration

Guides and Surveys integrates with Amplitude Experiment to enable:
- A/B testing of different guide and survey variants
- Multi-armed Bandit experiments
- Performance analysis through the Insights dashboard

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Analytics Events
- **Viewed**: When a guide or survey is shown to a user
- **Dismissed**: When a user actively closes a guide or survey
- **Completed**: When a user finishes all steps of a guide
- **Survey Submitted**: When a user completes and submits a survey
- **Survey Abandoned**: When a user starts but doesn't complete a survey

### Targeting and Triggers
- **Audience targeting**: Defines who sees the guide or survey
- **Trigger conditions**: Determines when and where guides appear
- **Priority settings**: Controls how guides are prioritized when multiple are eligible
- **Display limits**: Regulates how often guides can be shown
- **Guide status**: Indicates whether a guide is in draft, published, or scheduled state

### Technical Identifiers
- **Lifecycle UUID**: Unique identifier for a guide or survey instance
- **Variant ID**: Identifies experiment variants
- **Tooltip Marker**: Element that triggers a tooltip

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Guides and Surveys integrates with the broader Amplitude ecosystem through:

1. **Analytics Integration**: All interactions generate analytics events for analysis
2. **Experimentation**: Direct integration with Amplitude Experiment for A/B testing
3. **User Cohorts**: Leverages Amplitude's user segmentation for targeting
4. **Microscope**: Connects individual user journeys with guide and survey interactions

The platform also supports:
- **Localization**: Multi-language content without duplicates
- **Theming**: Customization of appearance through brand colors, typography, and component styles
- **Permissions System**: Role-based access control independent of base Amplitude roles
- **Proxy Configuration**: Support for reverse proxy using AWS CloudFront

## API References

The SDK provides several key methods for developers:

```javascript
// Initialize the SDK
amplitude.guides.boot({
  serverUrl: 'https://gs.amplitude.com',
  cdnUrl: 'https://cdn.amplitude.com',
  clientKey: 'YOUR_CLIENT_KEY'
});

// Forward events to the SDK
amplitude.guides.forwardEvent('event_name', {property1: 'value1'});

// Set theme mode
amplitude.guides.setThemeMode('dark');

// Add callbacks
amplitude.guides.addCallback('before_guide_displayed', function(guide) {
  // Custom logic
  return guide;
});

// Reset user history
amplitude.guides.reset();

// Show a specific guide
amplitude.guides.show('guide_id');

// List available guides
amplitude.guides.list();
```

These methods enable developers to control guide behavior, customize appearance, and integrate with existing analytics implementations.
