Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that replaces traditional popups with sophisticated, non-intrusive user engagement tools. The platform enables product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams to create targeted onboarding experiences, collect user feedback, and provide contextual assistance directly within their applications to improve user retention, activation, and engagement.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of three interconnected modules that form a complete user engagement ecosystem:

**Guides** deliver interactive user guidance through five specialized templates: Tours for step-by-step product exploration, Announcements for feature highlights and updates, Checklists for task-oriented workflows, Banners for persistent messaging, and Tooltips for contextual help. The guide system leverages advanced behavioral triggers including element appearance detection, time-based delays, rage click detection, and user confusion signals to deliver timely interventions.

**Surveys** focus on feedback collection through purpose-built templates including NPS (Net Promoter Score), User Feedback, and Rating surveys. The survey system features four distinct rating block types (Stars, Labels, Emoji, NPS variants) with conditional logic capabilities that enable dynamic response branching based on user inputs.

**Resource Center** functions as an intelligent help widget that integrates external documentation repositories, providing users with contextual assistance through semantic search, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. The Resource Center includes an Autopilot feature that automatically surfaces relevant content based on user location and behavior patterns.

## Form Factors and User Interface Design

The platform supports five distinct form factors that determine content presentation: Modal (with classic, horizontal split, and vertical split layouts), Popover (contextual overlays), Pin (persistent markers with overlay highlighting), Tooltip (hover/click reveal), and Banner (top/bottom positioning with sticky options). Each form factor supports multi-step functionality and interactive blocks including buttons, images, and videos with configurable layout options and actions.

## Advanced Targeting and Experimentation Framework

The Setup and Targeting system provides granular control over user experiences through segment-based targeting (All Users vs Targeted Users), sophisticated trigger conditions, page targeting rules with URL pattern matching, priority levels (Urgent/High/Medium/Low), display limits with cooldown periods, and active state management with tiebreaker logic for handling multiple eligible experiences.

Integration with Amplitude Experiment enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on both guides and surveys, featuring variant configuration, experiment management, exposure event tracking, and comprehensive analytics through the insights dashboard.

## Technical Implementation and SDK Integration

The **@amplitude/engagement-browser SDK** serves as the primary integration point, providing methods for initialization (`engagement.init()`), boot process (`engagement.boot()`), theme management, callbacks, routing, and localization. The SDK integrates seamlessly with the Amplitude Browser SDK, third-party analytics providers like Segment, and Google Tag Manager.

Key SDK methods include:
- `engagement.gs.show()` - Display specific guides or surveys
- `engagement.gs.reset()` - Reset user state and history
- `engagement.gs.list()` - Retrieve available experiences
- `engagement.gs.closeAll()` - Close all active experiences
- `addCallback()` - Handle custom event responses

For enterprise deployments, the platform supports AWS CloudFront reverse proxy configuration using dual origins (cdn.amplitude.com for static assets and gs.amplitude.com for API requests with /sdk/ prefix routing) to circumvent domain blocking while maintaining performance optimization.

## Analytics and Performance Insights

The platform delivers comprehensive analytics through multiple interfaces. The Overview tab provides real-time metrics including views, completions, rage closes, and interaction feeds. Survey analysis features the Insights tab for aggregate data with type-specific insights (NPS scoring, list breakdowns), time-based engagement charts with Microscope integration for session replay analysis, and the Responses tab for individual user response analysis with advanced sorting and filtering capabilities.

Analytics events follow a comprehensive taxonomy including common properties like Lifecycle UUID, Step ID, and Variant ID for A/B testing, plus specific events such as Guide Completed, Survey Submitted, and Tooltip Marker Viewed, all integrated with Amplitude's broader analytics platform.

## Localization and Design Customization

The localization system supports multilingual deployments through SDK locale initialization, Project settings for language management, and XLIFF file-based translation workflows. The platform serves content in multiple languages with fallback behavior and supports inline translation updates.

The Themes system provides extensive customization through the Theme Editor with Brand controls for accent colors, typography (including Google font library integration), content colors, borders, backgrounds, form controls, cards, widget dimensions, and animations. The Component editor enables creation of reusable design elements across guides and surveys.

## Access Control and Content Management

A three-tier permission system (Viewer, Member, Manager) overrides base Amplitude user roles to provide granular access control for viewing, editing drafts, publishing, and running experiments within the Guides and Surveys module, enabling organizations to maintain appropriate governance over their user experience programs.

The platform includes robust testing capabilities through preview mode, allowing developers to verify trigger, limit, and throttle conditions before launch. The testing interface provides condition status indicators, user history reset options, manual event triggering, and cohort-based live testing capabilities.

Content management extends to the Resource Center's Website scraper functionality, which extracts content from public websites using direct URLs or CSV/XML sitemap uploads, with advanced filtering options and content selectors for precise content curation.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Lifecycle UUID**: Unique identifier tracking individual user journeys through experiences
- **Rage Close**: User behavior indicating frustration when rapidly dismissing content
- **Autopilot**: Automated content recommendation system within Resource Center
- **Tiebreaker Logic**: System for prioritizing experiences when multiple qualify for display
- **Microscope Integration**: Session replay analysis for understanding user behavior
- **XLIFF Files**: Industry-standard translation file format for localization workflows
- **Multi-armed Bandit**: Advanced experimentation methodology for optimizing user experiences

The platform integrates deeply within the Amplitude ecosystem, leveraging the company's analytics infrastructure while providing specialized user experience capabilities that complement traditional product analytics with actionable user engagement tools.
