# Amplitude Guides and Surveys

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product messaging and feedback collection solution designed to enhance user experience within digital products. The platform enables product teams to deliver contextual guidance and gather user feedback without disrupting the user journey.

The product consists of two primary components:
- **Guides**: In-product messages with five template options (Tour, Announcement, Checklist, Banner, and Tooltip)
- **Surveys**: Feedback collection tools with three template options (NPS, User Feedback, and Rating)

Key use cases include improving user onboarding, announcing new features, collecting product feedback, and enhancing key metrics like retention, activation, and engagement.
