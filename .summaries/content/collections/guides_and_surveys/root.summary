Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to improve user onboarding, engagement, and feedback collection. The platform targets product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams seeking to enhance retention, activation, and engagement metrics through contextual user guidance and data collection.

## Core Product Components

The platform consists of three primary components that work together to create comprehensive user experiences:

**Guides** provide interactive in-product guidance through five distinct form factors: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual bubbles), Pin (persistent elements), Tooltip (hover information), Banner (notification bars), and Checklist (task lists). Each form factor supports multi-step functionality, customizable positioning, interactive blocks (buttons, images, videos), and advanced triggers. Guides utilize five template types: Tours for step-by-step product exploration, Announcements for feature introductions, Checklists for task completion, Banners for persistent messaging, and Tooltips for contextual help.

**Surveys** enable targeted feedback collection through four specialized block types: Rating blocks (supporting Stars, NPS, Emoji, and Rating labels), Long answer blocks for detailed responses, Short answer blocks for brief input, and List blocks for multiple choice options. Surveys support conditional logic for dynamic response paths and utilize a subset of guide form factors (modal, popover, pin) for deployment.

**Resource Center** functions as a help widget that integrates with the Guides and Surveys SDK, providing search functionality, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. It features Autopilot functionality that uses semantic search algorithms to automatically generate content recommendations from external documentation repositories.

## Technical Architecture and SDK Integration

The platform operates through dedicated SDKs across multiple platforms:

**Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with the Amplitude Browser SDK using `engagement.init()` and `engagement.boot()` methods, with `amplitude.add(window.engagement.plugin())` for plugin registration. It supports third-party analytics integrations including Segment, Google Tag Manager templates, and Content Security Policy (CSP) nonce configuration.

**Mobile SDKs** include iOS (`AmplitudeEngagement` class with Swift Package Manager/CocoaPods installation), Android (`AmplitudeEngagement` with gradle dependencies requiring API Level 24+ and Kotlin 1.8.22+), and React Native (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native` with deep linking support via `handleURL()`).

Key SDK methods include `show()`, `reset()`, `list()` for guide management, `forwardEvent()` for event-based triggers, `setThemeMode()` for appearance control, and `addCallback()` for custom button actions. All SDKs support preview mode with custom URL schemes for testing and development.

## Targeting and Behavioral Systems

The platform employs sophisticated targeting mechanisms combining user segmentation, behavioral triggers, and page-specific rules. User targeting supports "All Users" or "Targeted Users" with segment filtering, rollout percentages, and cohort-based bucketing. Behavioral triggers include element appearance/clicks (using CSS Selector and XPath targeting), time delays, smart delay, rage click detection, user confusion signals, and custom event tracking.

Page targeting utilizes URL matching rules (exact matches, contains, regex patterns) with priority levels (Urgent, High, Medium, Low) and display limits with cooldown periods. The system implements strike detection and rate-limiting mechanisms to prevent user fatigue, with active state management and tiebreaker logic for handling multiple eligible experiences.

## Experimentation and Analytics Framework

Amplitude Experiment integration enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys through variant configuration and exposure event tracking. The analytics system captures comprehensive event data including Lifecycle UUID, Step ID, Variant ID for A/B testing, and specific events like Guide Engaged/Completed/Dismissed and Survey Submitted/Abandoned/Completed.

The Insights dashboard provides aggregate metrics including views/completions over time, rage closes percentage, NPS breakdowns (promoters/detractors/passives), and real-time interaction feeds with Microscope integration for session replay analysis. Individual response data is accessible through the Responses tab with CSV export capabilities and advanced filtering options.

## Customization and Localization

The Themes system enables comprehensive branding customization through a Theme Editor with Brand controls and Component editor sections. Customizable elements include accent colors, Google Fonts typography, form controls styling, widget dimensions for each form factor, CSS properties configuration, animation settings, and platform-specific themes for web and mobile.

Localization support includes SDK initialization with locale parameters, Project settings for language management, and translation workflows using both web interface and .xliff file methods. The system provides locale code resolution with fallback behavior for serving multilingual content across different markets.

## Permissions and Content Management

The platform implements a five-tier permission system (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) that overrides base Amplitude user roles to provide granular access control for viewing, editing drafts, publishing, and running experiments. Content management includes Draft/Published/Schedule status workflows, version control, and collaborative editing capabilities.

Resource Center content sourcing supports documentation repositories and video sources with Website scraper functionality for URL extraction, CSV/XML sitemap upload, content selector overrides, and advanced filtering with URL path inclusion/exclusion rules. The system maintains sync history and error handling for automated content updates.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

The platform supports proxy configuration through AWS CloudFront for circumventing domain blocking, using dual origins (cdn.amplitude.com for static assets, gs.amplitude.com for API requests with /sdk/ prefix). Server zone configuration supports both EU and US deployments with appropriate data residency compliance.

Development and testing workflows include preview mode with condition verification (trigger, limit, throttle), Reset User History functionality, manual event triggering, and cohort-based live testing capabilities. The system provides comprehensive debugging tools including Debug Mode filtering and real-time condition status monitoring.
