# Amplitude Guides and Surveys

## Product Overview

Amplitude Guides and Surveys is an in-product messaging and feedback collection solution that helps improve user experience, facilitate product learning, gather user feedback, and enhance key metrics like retention, activation, and engagement. It provides contextual and less disruptive alternatives to traditional popup components for engaging users within digital products.

The platform consists of two main components:

1. **Guides**: In-product messages triggered by user behavior to help complete tasks or explore features. Available in five form factors (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, and Banner) and five templates (Tour, Announcement, Checklist, Banner, and Tooltip).

2. **Surveys**: Targeted feedback collection tools with three template options (NPS, User Feedback, and Rating) designed to measure customer satisfaction, gather specific feedback, and evaluate user reactions to product experiences.

This solution is particularly valuable for product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams seeking to optimize user journeys and improve product metrics.

The product follows Amplitude's permission model with role overrides specific to Guides and Surveys, allowing teams to grant different access levels (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator).

## Technical Implementation

### SDK Integration

```javascript
// Via Amplitude Browser SDK
import * as amplitude from '@amplitude/analytics-browser';
import * as engagement from '@amplitude/engagement-browser';

amplitude.init('API_KEY');
engagement.boot({
  client: amplitude,
  serverUrl: 'https://gs.amplitude.com',
  cdnUrl: 'https://cdn.amplitude.com'
});

// Via third-party analytics
import * as engagement from '@amplitude/engagement-browser';

engagement.boot({
  forwardEvent: (event) => {
    // Send to your analytics provider
    console.log(event);
  },
  serverUrl: 'https://gs.amplitude.com',
  cdnUrl: 'https://cdn.amplitude.com'
});
```

### Additional Configuration Options

```javascript
// Set theme mode
engagement.setThemeMode('dark');

// Add callback for guide/survey events
engagement.addCallback('guideViewed', (data) => {
  console.log('Guide viewed:', data);
});

// Configure for single-page applications
engagement.setRouter({
  onChange: (callback) => {
    // Listen for route changes and call callback
  }
});
```

### Localization Configuration

```javascript
engagement.boot({
  client: amplitude,
  locale: 'fr-FR',
  fallbackLocale: 'en-US'
});
```

### Proxy Configuration

The documentation includes instructions for setting up an AWS CloudFront distribution to reverse proxy both static assets and API traffic, helping bypass domain blocking while minimizing latency.

## Analytics Events

The platform tracks numerous events including:
- Guide/Survey Viewed
- Guide/Survey Dismissed
- Guide/Survey Completed
- Survey Submitted
- Guide Engaged
- Step Changed
- Button Clicked

Each event includes properties such as Lifecycle UUID, Guide/Survey ID, Template Type, Form Factor, Variant ID, and step information for multi-step guides.

These events can be analyzed through the Overview tab's analytics features, including filters, performance metrics, and interaction tracking for monitoring guide views, survey completions, and user engagement patterns.
