Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to improve user onboarding, engagement, and feedback collection. The platform enables product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams to create contextual, interactive experiences that drive retention, activation, and engagement metrics through targeted user communication within applications.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The platform consists of three core product areas that work together to create a unified user experience system:

**Guides** provide interactive user onboarding and engagement through five form factors: Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner, and Checklist. These guides support multi-step navigation, conditional logic, and various interactive blocks including buttons, images, and videos. Guide templates include Tours for step-by-step instructions, Announcements for feature updates, Checklists for task completion, Banners for persistent messaging, and Tooltips for contextual help.

**Surveys** enable targeted feedback collection through four block types: Rating (Stars, NPS, Emoji, Rating labels), Long answer, Short answer, and List blocks. Surveys support conditional logic for dynamic response paths and utilize a subset of guide form factors (modal, popover, pin). Survey templates include NPS surveys, User feedback forms, and Rating surveys for measuring customer satisfaction.

**Resource Center** functions as a help widget that integrates with the Guides and Surveys SDK, providing search functionality, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. It features an Autopilot system that uses semantic search algorithms to automatically generate content recommendations from documentation repositories, serving as a smart fallback when manual recommendation sets aren't configured.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Lifecycle UUID**: Unique identifier for tracking user interactions across guide and survey experiences
**Step ID/Step Index**: Sequential identifiers for multi-step guide navigation and analytics tracking
**Variant ID**: A/B testing identifier for experiment tracking through Amplitude Experiment integration
**Form Factors**: The visual presentation modes (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner, Checklist) that determine how content appears to users
**Targeting Resolution**: The process of determining which users see specific guides or surveys based on segments, page rules, and priority levels
**Throttling**: Rate limiting mechanism that controls how frequently guides and surveys appear to users
**Strike Detection**: System for identifying when users repeatedly encounter the same guide
**Smart Delay**: Intelligent timing mechanism that waits for optimal moments to display guides
**Rage Click/User Confusion**: Behavioral triggers that detect user frustration patterns
**Recommendation Sets**: Curated collections of articles and content for the Resource Center
**Autopilot**: Automated content recommendation system using semantic search

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Guides and Surveys integrates deeply with the Amplitude analytics ecosystem through comprehensive event tracking and the Amplitude Experiment platform for A/B testing. The system captures detailed analytics events including Guide Engaged, Guide Step Completed, Survey Submitted, Survey Abandoned, and Tooltip Marker Viewed, all feeding into Amplitude's analytics platform for performance measurement.

The platform supports multi-platform deployment through dedicated SDKs for web (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`), iOS (`AmplitudeEngagement`), Android (`amplitude-engagement-android`), and React Native (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`). Each SDK provides platform-specific initialization, screen tracking, element targeting, and preview mode capabilities.

Integration with third-party systems includes Segment analytics, Google Tag Manager, Microscope for session replays, and various chat modules. The platform supports proxy configurations through AWS CloudFront for enterprise deployments, with specific routing for static assets (`cdn.amplitude.com`) and API requests (`gs.amplitude.com`).

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Core SDK Methods**:
- `engagement.init()` and `engagement.boot()` for initialization
- `engagement.gs.show()`, `engagement.gs.reset()`, `engagement.gs.list()`, `engagement.gs.closeAll()` for guide management
- `forwardEvent()` for event-based triggers
- `setThemeMode()` for theme switching
- `addCallback()` for custom interactions
- `setRouter()` for SPA navigation

**Mobile SDK Configuration**:
- iOS: `AmplitudeEngagement` class with `accessibilityIdentifier` for element targeting
- Android: `AmplitudeEngagement` with `AmplitudeBootOptions` and `AmplitudeEndUser`
- React Native: `getPlugin()`, `handleURL()`, and `boot()` methods

**Critical API Paths**:
- `/sdk/*` pattern for API routing through proxy configurations
- `/sdk/admin/config` endpoint for preview mode functionality
- Custom URL schemes for deep linking and preview mode across mobile platforms

The platform includes comprehensive localization support through SDK locale configuration, AI-powered translation via Claude, and XLIFF file upload workflows. Permission management operates through a five-tier system (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) that overrides base Amplitude user roles to provide granular access control for viewing, editing, publishing, and experimenting within the Guides and Surveys module.
