Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that replaces traditional popups with sophisticated, contextual guidance and feedback collection systems. The platform enables product teams to deploy targeted onboarding experiences, gather user insights, and provide intelligent help resources directly within applications to improve user retention, activation, and engagement.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform operates through three interconnected components that deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** provide interactive in-product guidance through five distinct form factors: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual bubbles), Pin (persistent elements), Tooltip (hover information), Banner (notification bars), and Checklist (task lists). These guides support multi-step experiences with advanced customization including z-index positioning, text animations with typewriter effects, and interactive blocks containing buttons, images, and videos.

**Surveys** enable targeted feedback collection through four specialized block types: Rating blocks (supporting Stars, NPS, Emoji, and Rating labels), Long answer blocks for detailed responses, Short answer blocks for brief input, and List blocks for multiple choice options. The survey system implements conditional logic for dynamic response paths and supports randomized ordering with pre-fill capabilities using user properties.

**Resource Center** functions as an intelligent help widget that integrates external documentation repositories, provides semantic search functionality through Autopilot algorithms, displays recommended content, and offers quick links with customizable call-to-action buttons. The Resource Center can scrape website content, manage article visibility through Draft/Published states, and deliver personalized landing pages based on user context.

## Multi-Platform SDK Implementation

The platform provides comprehensive SDK support across web and mobile platforms with specific initialization methods and configuration options:

**Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with the Amplitude Browser SDK as a plugin and supports third-party analytics providers including Segment. Key methods include:
- `engagement.init()` and `engagement.boot()` for initialization
- `forwardEvent()` for event-based triggers
- `setThemeMode()` for theme management
- `updateLanguage()` for localization

**iOS SDK** (`AmplitudeEngagementSwift`) requires iOS 15+ and Swift 5.9+, supporting Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods installation with `AmplitudeEngagement.boot()` methods and `accessibilityIdentifier` for element targeting.

**Android SDK** (`amplitude-engagement-android`) requires API Level 24+ and Kotlin 1.8.22, utilizing `AmplitudeEngagement` class initialization with `AmplitudeBootOptions` configuration.

**React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) provides deep linking support through `handleURL()` methods and plugin booting with user/device ID initialization.

## Advanced Targeting and Experimentation Framework

The Setup and Targeting system implements sophisticated targeting mechanisms supporting user segmentation via properties and cohorts, trigger conditions including element appearance/clicks, time delays, smart delay, rage click detection, and user confusion detection. Page targeting utilizes CSS selectors and XPath expressions with URL matching patterns, while priority levels (Urgent/High/Medium/Low) manage display precedence with tiebreaker logic.

**Amplitude Experiment integration** enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, with variant configuration, exposure event tracking, and insights dashboard analytics. The experimentation framework supports treatment vs control groups with configurable rollout percentages and Manager role permissions for experiment execution.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Lifecycle UUID** serves as the primary identifier for tracking user interactions across guide and survey experiences throughout their engagement session.

**Step ID and Step Index** manage multi-step experience navigation and analytics tracking, enabling precise measurement of user progression through complex workflows.

**Variant ID** enables A/B testing identification within experimental frameworks, allowing for performance comparison across different experience versions.

**Form Factors** define visual presentation modes with specific behavioral characteristics and use cases for different interaction patterns.

**Blocks** represent modular content components within surveys that support conditional logic and dynamic response handling.

**Autopilot** refers to the Resource Center's semantic search algorithm that automatically generates content recommendations by analyzing repository content and user context.

## Analytics and Event Tracking Infrastructure

The platform generates comprehensive analytics events tracked through Amplitude, including Guide Completed, Survey Submitted, and Tooltip Marker Viewed events. Common properties include Lifecycle UUID, Step ID, Step Index, and Variant ID for experimental identification. Debug Mode filtering enables development environment separation from production analytics.

Survey analysis features provide aggregate data through the Insights tab with type-specific insights including NPS scoring (promoters, detractors, passives), list breakdowns, and filtering capabilities. Time-based engagement charts integrate with Microscope for session replay analysis, while the Responses tab enables individual user response analysis with sorting and filtering options.

## Localization and Theming Capabilities

**Localization support** enables multilingual content delivery through SDK locale initialization, Project settings language configuration, and translation workflows using both web interface and .xliff file methods. The system implements locale code language resolution with translation fallback behavior for Growth and Enterprise plan customers.

**Themes functionality** provides comprehensive branding customization through the Theme Editor, including Brand controls for accent colors and typography using Google fonts, Component editor for form controls styling, widget dimensions configuration, and animation settings with CSS properties configuration.

## Permission Management and Deployment Architecture

The platform implements a five-tier permission system: No access, Viewer (read-only), Member (draft editing), Manager (publishing and experiments), and Administrator (full access). These permissions override base Amplitude user roles to provide granular access control within the Guides and Surveys module.

**Deployment infrastructure** supports proxy configuration through AWS CloudFront for domain blocking circumvention, utilizing dual origins (cdn.amplitude.com for static assets, gs.amplitude.com for API requests) with /sdk/ path prefix routing. Content Security Policy (CSP) directives ensure secure deployment, while Single Page Application (SPA) router configuration enables seamless integration with modern web frameworks.

## Ecosystem Integration

The platform integrates deeply with the broader Amplitude ecosystem through event forwarding to the core analytics platform, cohort targeting for user segmentation, user property utilization for personalization, and Microscope session replay integration for behavioral analysis. This integration provides a comprehensive solution for in-product user experience optimization that leverages existing Amplitude data infrastructure and analytics capabilities to deliver contextual, data-driven user experiences.
