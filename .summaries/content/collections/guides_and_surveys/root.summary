Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that enables product teams to deploy contextual guidance and collect user feedback directly within applications. The platform serves as an intelligent alternative to traditional popups, focusing on improving user retention, activation, and engagement through targeted onboarding experiences and real-time feedback collection.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform operates through three interconnected components that deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** provide interactive in-product guidance through five distinct form factors: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual bubbles), Pin (persistent elements), Tooltip (hover information), and Banner (notification bars). These guides support multi-step navigation with advanced triggering capabilities and various interactive blocks including buttons, images, and videos. Template options include Tours for step-by-step onboarding, Announcements for feature releases, Checklists for task completion, Banners for notifications, and Tooltips for contextual help.

**Surveys** enable targeted feedback collection through specialized block types including Rating (Stars, NPS, Emoji, Rating labels), Long answer, Short answer, and List blocks. The survey system supports conditional logic for dynamic response paths and utilizes modal, popover, and pin form factors. Survey templates encompass NPS for customer satisfaction measurement, User feedback for general input collection, and Rating surveys for specific evaluations.

**Resource Center** functions as an intelligent help widget that integrates with the Guides and Surveys SDK, providing search functionality, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. The Resource Center features Autopilot functionality that uses semantic search algorithms to automatically generate content recommendations from external documentation repositories.

## Multi-Platform SDK Integration

The platform supports comprehensive deployment through dedicated SDKs across multiple platforms:

- **Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with Amplitude Browser SDK, third-party analytics providers like Segment, and Google Tag Manager
- **iOS SDK** (AmplitudeEngagement) supports Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods installation with iOS 15+ requirements
- **Android SDK** (amplitude-engagement-android) requires Android API Level 24+ and Kotlin 1.8.22
- **React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) includes deep linking support

All SDKs provide core methods including `init()`, `boot()`, `show()`, `reset()`, `list()`, and support for preview mode configuration with custom URL schemes for development and testing workflows.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Lifecycle UUID** - Unique identifier that tracks user interaction sessions across guides and surveys, enabling session continuity and analytics correlation

**Step ID/Step Index** - Sequential identifiers used for multi-step experience navigation and progress tracking

**Variant ID** - A/B testing configuration identifier that manages experiment variations and user assignment

**Strike Detection** - Behavioral trigger mechanism that identifies specific user interaction patterns to initiate contextual experiences

**Rate-limiting** - Throttling mechanism that controls guide and survey display frequency to prevent user fatigue

**Smart Delay** - Intelligent timing trigger that analyzes user behavior patterns to optimize experience timing

**Rage Click** - Detection mechanism for frustrated user interactions, specifically rapid clicking behaviors

**User Confusion Detection** - Behavioral analysis system that identifies users struggling with interface elements

**Recommendation Sets** - Curated content collections used for Resource Center personalization and content delivery

**Autopilot** - Automated content recommendation system utilizing semantic search algorithms for intelligent content matching

**ThemeMode** - Visual appearance configuration supporting LIGHT/DARK/SYSTEM/auto modes for consistent brand experience

## Advanced Targeting and Personalization System

The platform employs sophisticated targeting capabilities across multiple dimensions:

**User Targeting** supports All Users or Targeted Users configurations with property and cohort filtering for precise audience segmentation. **Trigger Conditions** include element appearance/clicks, time delays, smart delay, rage click detection, user confusion detection, and custom event tracking.

**Page Targeting** utilizes URL matching patterns, CSS selectors, and XPath expressions for precise placement control and contextual relevance. **Priority Levels** (Urgent/High/Medium/Low) manage multiple experience conflicts through intelligent tiebreaker logic, while **Display Limits** and cooldown periods prevent user experience fatigue.

The system supports **Draft/Published/Schedule** status management with active state behavior controls, enabling sophisticated content lifecycle management.

## Analytics Integration and Experimentation

Amplitude Experiment integration enables comprehensive A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys. The analytics system tracks detailed event properties including:

- Generic events: Viewed, Dismissed, Completed
- Guide-specific events: Guide Engaged, Guide Step Completed
- Survey-specific events: Survey Submitted, Survey Abandoned
- Interaction events: Tooltip Marker Viewed, Rage Closed

The **Insights Dashboard** provides aggregate data analysis with type-specific insights including NPS scoring (promoters/detractors/passives classification), time-based engagement charts with Microscope integration for session replays, and individual user response analysis through the Responses tab.

## Localization and Brand Customization

**Localization** support includes SDK locale initialization, Project settings language configuration, and comprehensive translation workflows using both web interface and .xliff file methods. The system provides translation fallback behavior and supports multilingual content delivery with automatic language detection.

**Themes** enable comprehensive branding customization through the Theme Editor with Brand controls and Component editor sections. Customization capabilities include accent colors, Google Fonts typography integration, form controls styling, widget dimensions, CSS properties configuration, animation settings, and platform-specific themes for web and mobile environments.

## Infrastructure and Enterprise Deployment

The platform supports **proxy configuration** through AWS CloudFront for domain blocking circumvention, utilizing dual origins (cdn.amplitude.com for static assets, gs.amplitude.com for API requests with /sdk/ prefix). **Server Zone** configuration supports both EU and US deployments with appropriate data residency compliance for enterprise requirements.

**Permission Management** implements a five-tier system (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) that overrides base Amplitude user roles, providing granular access control for viewing, editing drafts, publishing, and running experiments within the Guides and Surveys module.

## Ecosystem Integration and Positioning

Amplitude Guides and Surveys integrates seamlessly with the broader Amplitude ecosystem, leveraging existing user segmentation, cohort management, and analytics infrastructure. The platform complements traditional analytics and experimentation workflows by providing specialized in-product engagement capabilities that bridge the gap between user behavior analysis and direct user experience optimization.

The platform positions itself as a comprehensive solution for product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams seeking to implement data-driven in-product experiences that enhance user onboarding, feature adoption, and feedback collection while maintaining consistency with existing analytics and experimentation frameworks.
