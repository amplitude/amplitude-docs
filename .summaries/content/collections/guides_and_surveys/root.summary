Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user engagement platform that replaces traditional popups with contextual, non-intrusive messaging experiences. The platform empowers product, growth, and product marketing teams to enhance user onboarding, collect feedback, and improve retention, activation, and engagement metrics through sophisticated targeting and personalization capabilities.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform operates through three interconnected components that deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** serve as interactive, multi-step experiences for user onboarding and feature exploration. They support six template types (Tour, Announcement, Checklists, Carousel, Banners, Tooltips) implemented through five form factors (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner, and Checklist). Guides feature advanced positioning capabilities, multi-step configurations, and interactive blocks including buttons, images, and videos.

**Surveys** focus on feedback collection through four specialized block types (Rating, Long answer, Short answer, List) with conditional logic enabling dynamic response branching. They support multiple rating formats including Stars, NPS, Emoji, and Rating labels, utilizing a subset of guide form factors (modal, popover, pin) for consistent user experience.

**Resource Center** functions as an integrated help widget providing search functionality, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. It connects with external documentation repositories through website scraping capabilities and supports semantic search via Autopilot for automatic article recommendations.

## Multi-Platform SDK Implementation

The platform delivers comprehensive cross-platform deployment through dedicated SDKs:

- **Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with Amplitude Browser SDK, third-party analytics providers like Segment, and Google Tag Manager
- **iOS SDK** (`Amplitude-Engagement-Swift`) supports Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods installation with SwiftUI integration
- **Android SDK** (`amplitude-engagement-android`) provides Jetpack Compose support with `.amplitudeView` modifier
- **React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) enables cross-platform mobile deployment

Each SDK provides standardized methods including `engagement.init()` and `engagement.boot()` for initialization, element targeting capabilities, screen tracking, theme management, and preview mode configuration with custom URL schemes.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Form Factors** define visual presentation and positioning strategies: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual bubbles), Pin (anchored elements), Tooltip (hover information), Banner (persistent notifications), and Checklist (task-oriented interfaces).

**Targeting and Triggers** control content delivery timing and audience selection, supporting element appearance/clicks, time delays, rage clicks, user confusion detection, event tracking, and sophisticated user segmentation with cohort targeting and page-specific URL matching patterns.

**Lifecycle Management** encompasses status states (draft, published, scheduled), priority levels (urgent, high, medium, low), display limits with cooldown periods, and throttling controls managing artifact appearance frequency across time periods (day/week/month/session).

**Analytics Integration** leverages Amplitude event tracking with specific events including Guide Viewed, Guide Completed, Guide Engaged, Survey Submitted, and Survey Abandoned, along with common properties like App Type, Lifecycle UUID, Step ID, and Variant ID for A/B testing.

## Advanced Features and Customization

**Experimentation** integrates with Amplitude Experiment to support A/B tests and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, featuring variant configuration, exposure event handling, and insights dashboard analytics for performance tracking.

**Personalization** includes dynamic content insertion through client-side user properties, localization support for multiple languages with XLIFF file workflows and AI-powered translation, and comprehensive theme customization through the Theme Editor with brand controls and component styling.

**Resource Center Capabilities** feature Autopilot's semantic search algorithm for automatic content recommendations, configurable recommendation sets with various action types (visit link, click element, run callback, open third-party chat, show guide/survey, open article, play video), and website scraper functionality for content repository integration.

## Permissions and Access Control

The platform implements a three-tier permission system (Viewer, Member, Manager) that overrides base Amplitude user roles, providing granular access control for viewing, editing drafts, publishing content, and running experiments within the Guides and Surveys module.

## Technical Integration Points and API Methods

Key technical integration methods include:
- `engagement.forwardEvent()` for event-based triggers
- `engagement.setThemeMode()` for theme management
- `engagement.addCallback()` for custom button actions
- `engagement.setRouter()` for single-page application navigation
- `engagement.updateLanguage()` for localization

The platform supports Content Security Policy (CSP) nonce configuration, proxy setup with custom `serverUrl` and `cdnUrl` parameters, and server zone configuration for EU/US data residency requirements.

## Ecosystem Integration

Guides and Surveys integrates deeply within the broader Amplitude ecosystem through shared user properties, event tracking, cohort targeting, and Microscope session replay integration. This creates a unified approach to user engagement and analytics, leveraging Amplitude's comprehensive user behavior tracking and segmentation capabilities to deliver contextually relevant in-product experiences that drive measurable improvements in user activation, retention, and overall product engagement metrics.
