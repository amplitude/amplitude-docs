Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to enhance user onboarding, collect feedback, and improve retention, activation, and engagement metrics. The platform enables product, growth, and product marketing teams to create contextual, interactive experiences directly within their applications.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of three primary components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** are interactive, multi-step experiences designed for user onboarding and product education. They support five distinct form factors: Modals (overlay dialogs), Popovers (contextual bubbles), Pins (persistent markers), Tooltips (hover information), Banners (notification strips), and Checklists (task-oriented workflows). Guides utilize behavioral triggers including element appearance/clicks, time delays, rage clicks, user confusion detection, and custom event tracking.

**Surveys** focus on feedback collection through four specialized block types: Rating blocks (supporting Stars, NPS, Emoji, and custom Rating labels), Long answer blocks for detailed responses, Short answer blocks for brief input, and List blocks for multiple choice options. Surveys support conditional logic for dynamic response branching and utilize a subset of guide form factors (modal, popover, pin).

**Resource Center** functions as a help widget that integrates with the Guides and Surveys SDK, providing search functionality, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. It features an Autopilot system that uses semantic search algorithms to automatically generate article recommendations by analyzing page content and surfacing relevant materials from configured content repositories.

## SDK Implementation and Platform Support

The platform provides comprehensive SDK support across multiple platforms through dedicated packages:

- **Web SDK**: `@amplitude/engagement-browser` with integration support for Amplitude Browser SDK, third-party analytics providers like Segment, and Google Tag Manager
- **iOS SDK**: `Amplitude-Engagement-Swift` supporting Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods installation
- **Android SDK**: `amplitude-engagement-android` with Jetpack Compose support via `.amplitudeView` modifier
- **React Native SDK**: `@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native` with deep linking configuration

All SDKs share common initialization patterns using `AmplitudeEngagement` classes with boot options for user/device ID configuration, screen tracking capabilities, and element targeting systems using accessibility identifiers and CSS selectors.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Form Factors** define the visual presentation and interaction patterns of guides, each with specific customization properties including position controls, z-index settings, and click-outside-to-close behaviors.

**Blocks** are the fundamental building components within guides and surveys, supporting interactive elements like buttons (with CTA actions for visit link, click element, show guide, run callback), images, videos, and form inputs.

**Targeting and Segmentation** encompasses user segmentation through cohorts, page targeting with URL matching patterns, session properties via `setSessionProperty()`, and trigger conditions that determine when content appears.

**Lifecycle Management** includes status states (draft, published, scheduled), priority levels (urgent, high, medium, low), display limits with cooldown periods, and active state behavior with tiebreaker rules.

**Analytics Schema** tracks engagement through specific events including Guide Viewed/Completed/Dismissed, Survey Submitted/Abandoned/Completed, with common properties like Lifecycle UUID for event grouping, Step ID/Index for navigation tracking, and Variant ID for A/B testing.

## Advanced Features and Capabilities

**Experimentation Integration** with Amplitude Experiment enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, including variant configuration, exposure event handling, and performance analytics through the insights dashboard.

**Localization Support** allows serving content in multiple languages through SDK locale configuration, project language settings, fallback behavior, and content translation via web interface, AI localization with Claude, or XLIFF file upload workflows.

**Personalization** through the "Personalize with Variables" feature dynamically inserts client-side user properties into text blocks with configurable fallback values when properties are unavailable.

**Custom Styling** via CSS class selectors enables theme customization for all form factors and survey elements, though this remains a web SDK-only beta feature with specific amplitude-engagement CSS classes.

**Throttling Controls** manage the rate and frequency of guide/survey appearances through configurable limits across different time periods (day/week/month/session), with separate settings for guides versus surveys.

## Broader Ecosystem Integration

The platform integrates deeply with the Amplitude ecosystem through native analytics event tracking, user property synchronization, and cohort-based targeting. It supports proxy configurations via AWS CloudFront for enterprise deployments, with specific cache behaviors for the critical `/sdk/*` path pattern handling API routing.

**Permission Management** operates through a five-tier system (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) that overrides base Amplitude user roles, providing granular control over viewing, editing, publishing, and experiment execution capabilities.

**Template System** enables creation of reusable starting points for guides and surveys, with visibility management and integration into the Create Guide/Survey workflow, supporting theme inheritance and pre-configured targeting.

**Testing and Preview** capabilities include preview mode for condition verification, live testing through cohort targeting, and troubleshooting tools with user history reset and manual event triggering.

The platform's API endpoints center around the `/sdk/*` path pattern for core functionality, with specific routes like `/sdk/admin/config` for preview mode configuration. Mobile implementations utilize custom URL schemes for deep linking and preview functionality, while web implementations support Content Security Policy (CSP) nonce configurations and single-page application routing through `engagement.setRouter()`.
