Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that replaces traditional popups with contextual, interactive guidance and feedback collection tools. The platform targets product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams focused on improving user onboarding, engagement, retention, and activation metrics through sophisticated user experience orchestration.

## Product Architecture and Core Components

The platform operates through three interconnected components that create cohesive user experiences:

**Guides** deliver interactive in-product guidance through five distinct form factors: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual bubbles), Pin (persistent elements), Tooltip (hover information), Banner (page-wide notifications), and Checklist (task-oriented workflows). Each form factor supports multi-step functionality, customizable positioning, advanced behavioral triggers, strike detection, rate-limiting mechanisms, and interactive elements including buttons, images, and videos.

**Surveys** enable targeted feedback collection through specialized block types including Rating (Stars, NPS, Emoji, Rating labels), Long answer, Short answer, and List blocks. These support conditional logic for dynamic response paths and utilize a subset of guide form factors (modal, popover, pin) to maintain visual consistency across user experiences.

**Resource Center** functions as an integrated help widget that provides search functionality, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. The Resource Center features Autopilot functionality utilizing semantic search algorithms to automatically generate content recommendations from external documentation repositories.

## Technical Integration and SDK Architecture

The platform operates through dedicated SDKs across multiple platforms with a dual-origin architecture using `cdn.amplitude.com` for static assets and `gs.amplitude.com` for API requests with `/sdk/` prefix routing.

**Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with the Amplitude Browser SDK through `engagement.init()` and `engagement.boot()` methods, supporting third-party analytics providers, Google Tag Manager, and Content Security Policy configurations.

**Mobile SDKs** include iOS (`AmplitudeEngagement` class with Swift Package Manager/CocoaPods installation), Android (`amplitude-engagement-android` with gradle dependencies), and React Native (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) implementations. All mobile SDKs support deep linking and preview mode functionality.

The platform supports AWS CloudFront reverse proxy configurations for domain blocking circumvention and provides comprehensive API integration capabilities.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Lifecycle UUID** serves as the primary identifier for tracking user interactions across guide and survey experiences, while **Step ID** and **Step Index** provide granular tracking of multi-step experience progression. **Variant ID** enables A/B testing functionality through Amplitude Experiment integration.

**Form Factors** define visual presentation methods with specific configuration properties including z-index positioning, text animation effects, and advanced trigger element interactions. **Targeting** encompasses user segmentation (All Users vs Targeted Users), trigger mechanisms (element appearance/clicks, time delays, smart delay, rage click, user confusion, event tracking), page targeting rules using CSS selectors and XPath, and priority levels (Urgent, High, Medium, Low).

**Themes** provide comprehensive branding customization through the Theme Editor with Brand controls and Component editor sections, supporting platform-specific styling for web and mobile implementations.

## Analytics Integration and Experimentation Framework

The platform provides extensive analytics capabilities through native Amplitude integration, tracking events including Guide Engaged, Guide Step Completed, Survey Submitted, Survey Abandoned, and Tooltip Marker Viewed. The analytics framework includes a comprehensive glossary defining common properties and events for user interaction tracking, with Debug Mode filtering capabilities.

**Experiment Integration** with Amplitude Experiment enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, including variant configuration, exposure event handling, and insights dashboard analytics with performance overview metrics and time-based analysis.

**Survey Analysis** features include the Insights tab for aggregate metrics and trends (with NPS-specific breakdowns and Microscope integration) and the Responses tab for individual user response data with export and filtering capabilities.

## Localization and Content Management Systems

The platform supports comprehensive localization through SDK locale initialization, Project settings language configuration, and three translation methods: web interface editing, AI-powered translation using Claude, and XLIFF file workflow integration. Translation fallback behavior ensures consistent user experiences across different locales.

**Resource Center Content Management** includes website scraper functionality for URL extraction, CSV/XML sitemap upload capabilities, content selector overrides, and sync error management through the Sync errors interface.

## Access Control and Permissions Framework

The platform implements a three-tier permission system (Viewer, Member, Manager) that overrides base Amplitude user roles, providing granular access control for viewing, editing drafts, publishing, and running experiments. This extends to five access levels (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) with specific capabilities managed through the Guides and Surveys > Permissions interface.

## Testing and Quality Assurance Capabilities

**Preview Mode** enables comprehensive testing of guides and surveys, allowing verification of trigger, limit, and throttle conditions before launch. The system provides condition status indicators (green/yellow/blue), Reset User History functionality, and cohort targeting for live testing scenarios.

## Ecosystem Integration and Positioning

Amplitude Guides and Surveys integrates seamlessly with the broader Amplitude ecosystem, leveraging existing user segmentation, analytics infrastructure, and experimentation capabilities while providing specialized tools for in-product user experience optimization. The platform serves as a bridge between Amplitude's analytics capabilities and actionable user engagement, enabling data-driven user experience decisions through contextual guidance and feedback collection mechanisms.

The platform positions itself as a comprehensive alternative to traditional popup solutions, providing sophisticated targeting, analytics integration, and user experience orchestration capabilities that align with modern product development workflows and user experience best practices.
