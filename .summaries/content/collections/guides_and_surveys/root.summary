Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user engagement platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to enhance user onboarding, collect feedback, and improve retention, activation, and engagement metrics. The platform enables product, growth, and product marketing teams to create contextual, non-intrusive messaging experiences directly within their applications.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of three primary components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** are interactive, multi-step experiences designed for user onboarding and feature exploration. They support six template types: Tour (step-by-step walkthroughs), Announcement (feature introductions), Checklists (task completion tracking), Carousel (mobile-optimized onboarding), Banners (persistent messaging), and Tooltips (contextual help). Guides utilize behavioral triggers, strike detection, and rate-limiting mechanisms to ensure optimal user experience.

**Surveys** focus on feedback collection through four unique block types: Rating (Stars, NPS, Emoji, Rating labels), Long answer, Short answer, and List blocks. Surveys support conditional logic for dynamic response branching and are available in modal, popover, and pin form factors. The platform provides specialized survey templates including NPS, User feedback, Rating, Carousel, Banner Survey, and Tooltip Survey configurations.

**Resource Center** functions as a help widget that integrates search functionality, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. It features an Autopilot system that uses semantic search algorithms to automatically generate article recommendations by analyzing page content and surfacing relevant materials from content repositories.

## Form Factors and Customization

The platform supports five primary form factors that determine how content appears to users: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual containers), Pin (targeted page elements), Tooltip (contextual hints), Banner (persistent messaging), and Checklist (task tracking). Each form factor includes extensive customization options including position settings, layout configurations (classic, horizontal split, vertical split), button actions (visit link, click element, show guide/survey, run callback), and format settings like z-index, text animation, and click-outside-to-close behavior.

The Themes system provides comprehensive branding control through a Theme Editor with Brand controls and Component editor sections, allowing customization of colors, typography (Google fonts integration), form controls, widget dimensions, animations, and platform-specific styling for web and mobile applications.

## SDK Implementation and Platform Support

Amplitude provides native SDKs for multiple platforms with consistent APIs and functionality:

**Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with the Amplitude Browser SDK 2.0 as a plugin, supports third-party analytics providers like Segment, and includes Google Tag Manager templates. Key methods include `engagement.init()`, `engagement.boot()`, `engagement.gs.show()`, and `engagement.gs.reset()`.

**iOS SDK** (`Amplitude-Engagement-Swift`) supports Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods installation, requires iOS 15+ and Swift 5.9+, and uses `AmplitudeEngagement` class with `accessibilityIdentifier` and `amplitudeView` modifier for element targeting.

**Android SDK** (`amplitude-engagement-android`) supports Jetpack Compose through `.amplitudeView` modifier and traditional Android views using `contentDescription`/`tag` selectors, requires Android API Level 24+ and Kotlin 1.8.22+.

**React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) integrates with `@amplitude/analytics-react-native` and includes deep linking configuration through `handleURL()` method.

## Targeting and Personalization

The Setup and Targeting system provides granular control over content delivery through multiple mechanisms:

**User Targeting** supports "All Users" or "Targeted Users" configurations with segment-based targeting, rollout percentages, and bucketing units for controlled deployments.

**Trigger Mechanisms** include element appearance/clicks, time delays, smart delay, rage click detection, user confusion detection, and event tracking. These triggers use CSS Selector and XPath targeting for precise element identification.

**Page Targeting** employs URL matching patterns and query parameters to control where content appears, with support for visual selectors and temporarily hide conditions.

The platform includes a Personalize with Variables feature that dynamically inserts client-side user properties into content, with configurable fallback values when properties are unavailable.

## Analytics and Experimentation

Comprehensive analytics tracking is implemented through Amplitude with events prefixed `[Guides-Surveys]`. Common event properties include App Type, Lifecycle UUID, Step ID, Step Index, Variant ID, and Source.type. Specific events track guide interactions (Guide Viewed, Guide Completed, Guide Engaged), survey responses (Survey Submitted, Survey Abandoned, Survey Response), and Resource Center activities.

The Insights tab provides aggregate metrics and trends with NPS-specific breakdowns for promoters, passives, and detractors. The Responses tab offers individual user response data with CSV export capabilities up to 10,000 responses.

**Amplitude Experiment Integration** enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, with variant configuration, exposure event handling, and performance tracking through the insights dashboard.

## Advanced Features

**Localization Support** enables multi-language content delivery through SDK locale configuration, with translation workflows supporting AI localization (Claude), XLIFF file uploads, and fallback behavior configuration.

**Custom CSS Styling** (Web SDK only, beta) provides CSS class selectors for targeting form factors and survey elements using `amplitude-engagement` CSS classes.

**Proxy Configuration** supports AWS CloudFront setup as a reverse proxy with specific origins (`cdn.amplitude.com` for static assets, `gs.amplitude.com` for API requests) and cache behaviors including the critical `/sdk/*` path pattern.

**Testing and Preview Mode** allows developers to verify conditions and settings before launch, with troubleshooting capabilities and live testing using cohort targeting.

## Permission System and Management

The platform implements a five-tier permission system (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) that overrides base Amplitude user roles to provide granular access control for viewing, editing drafts, publishing, and running experiments within the Guides and Surveys module.

Content organization is supported through a comprehensive tags system with bulk operations, filtering capabilities, and campaign/feature/team categorization. Templates provide reusable starting points with visibility management and theme inheritance.

**Throttling Configuration** controls the rate and frequency of content appearance through configurable limits and time periods (day/week/month/session), with separate settings for guides versus surveys to optimize user experience and prevent over-messaging.
