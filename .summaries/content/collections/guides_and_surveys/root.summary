Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that replaces traditional popups with contextual, interactive experiences designed to enhance user onboarding, collect feedback, and improve retention, activation, and engagement metrics. The platform empowers product, growth, and product marketing teams to create sophisticated user journeys directly within their applications.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform operates through three interconnected components that deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** serve as interactive, multi-step experiences for user onboarding and product exploration. They support five distinct form factors (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner, and Checklist) and offer pre-built templates including Tours, Announcements, Checklists, Banners, and Tooltips. Guides incorporate interactive blocks such as buttons, images, and videos, with advanced capabilities including conditional logic and multi-step navigation for creating dynamic user flows.

**Surveys** focus on feedback collection through four specialized block types: Rating blocks (featuring Stars, NPS, Emoji, and Rating labels), Long answer, Short answer, and List blocks. Surveys leverage conditional logic for dynamic response branching and utilize a subset of guide form factors (modal, popover, pin). The platform delivers comprehensive analytics through Insights tabs for aggregate metrics and Responses tabs for granular individual user data analysis.

**Resource Center** functions as an integrated help widget that works with the Guides and Surveys SDK to provide search functionality, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. Its Autopilot system employs semantic search to automatically generate article recommendations by analyzing page content and surfacing relevant articles from connected content repositories.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

The platform employs specific terminology for tracking and configuration management:

- **Lifecycle UUID**: Unique identifier for tracking user interactions across complete guide/survey sessions
- **Step ID/Step Index**: Identifiers for individual steps within multi-step experiences, enabling granular interaction tracking
- **Variant ID**: Used for A/B testing and experimentation within guides and surveys, supporting performance comparison
- **Form Factors**: Visual presentation modes that determine how content appears to users (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner, Checklist)
- **Throttling**: Rate limiting controls that manage frequency and timing of guide and survey appearances to prevent user fatigue
- **Strike Detection**: Mechanism for tracking user interaction patterns and engagement levels across sessions
- **Recommendation Sets**: Customizable collections of articles and information curated for Resource Center display

## SDK Implementation and Technical Integration

The platform supports multi-platform deployment through dedicated SDKs with specific implementation patterns:

**Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with the Amplitude Browser SDK and supports third-party analytics providers including Segment and Google Tag Manager. Core methods include `engagement.init()` for initialization, `engagement.boot()` for activation, `engagement.forwardEvent()` for event forwarding, and `engagement.gs.show()` for programmatic display control.

**iOS SDK** utilizes Swift Package Manager or CocoaPods installation with `AmplitudeEngagement` class initialization. It supports element targeting through `accessibilityIdentifier` properties and includes `.amplitudeView` modifier for SwiftUI implementations, enabling precise UI element targeting.

**Android SDK** integrates via gradle dependencies with `AmplitudeEngagement` class initialization. It supports Jetpack Compose through `.amplitudeView` modifier and traditional Android views using `contentDescription` or `tag` selectors for element identification.

**React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) works in conjunction with `@amplitude/analytics-react-native` and includes deep linking configuration through the `handleURL()` function for cross-platform navigation support.

## Analytics and Experimentation Framework

The platform provides comprehensive analytics through Amplitude event tracking, automatically capturing events including Guide Viewed, Guide Completed, Survey Submitted, and Survey Abandoned. Integration with Amplitude Experiment enables sophisticated A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, with variant configuration and performance tracking delivered through dedicated insights dashboards.

## Advanced Features and Customization

**Targeting and Personalization**: The platform supports sophisticated targeting through user segmentation, behavioral triggers (element appearance/clicks, time delays, rage clicks, user confusion detection), session properties, and page targeting with URL matching patterns. The "Personalize with Variables" feature enables dynamic insertion of client-side user properties into content, creating highly personalized experiences.

**Theming and Styling**: Custom CSS styling is available for web SDK implementations, featuring comprehensive theme management including colors, typography, form controls, and animations. The Theme Editor provides Brand controls and Component editor sections for detailed visual customization that maintains brand consistency.

**Localization**: Multi-language support operates through SDK locale configuration, with content translation available via web interface, AI localization, or XLIFF file upload. The system includes fallback behavior configuration to ensure content availability across different language preferences.

**Permissions and Access Control**: Role-based permission system implements five access levels (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) that override base Amplitude user roles, providing granular control over viewing, editing, publishing, and experiment execution capabilities.

## Broader Ecosystem Integration

Guides and Surveys integrates deeply within the Amplitude ecosystem, leveraging Amplitude Analytics for comprehensive event tracking, Amplitude Experiment for sophisticated A/B testing capabilities, and supporting proxy configurations through AWS CloudFront for enterprise-grade deployments. The platform maintains Content Security Policy (CSP) compliance and offers preview modes for thorough testing and validation before production deployment.

The Resource Center component extends platform capabilities by connecting to external documentation repositories through website scraping functionality, with advanced filtering options and content management features that enable organizations to create comprehensive self-service support experiences. This integration transforms static documentation into dynamic, contextual help systems that respond to user behavior and needs.
