Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to improve user retention, activation, and engagement through targeted onboarding experiences and feedback collection. The platform enables product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams to deploy contextual guidance and gather user insights directly within their applications.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of two primary components: **Guides** for interactive user onboarding and **Surveys** for feedback collection. Guides support five distinct form factors (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner, and Checklist) with multi-step functionality and interactive blocks including buttons, images, and videos. Surveys utilize four unique block types (Rating, Long answer, Short answer, List) with conditional logic for dynamic response paths, supporting specialized rating types including Stars, NPS, Emoji, and Rating labels.

The **Resource Center** serves as an intelligent content hub that integrates with the Guides and Surveys SDK, providing search functionality, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. It features an Autopilot system that uses semantic search algorithms to automatically generate content recommendations from external documentation repositories.

## Technical Implementation

The platform operates through multi-platform SDKs supporting web (@amplitude/engagement-browser), iOS (AmplitudeEngagement), Android (amplitude-engagement-android), and React Native (@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native). The web SDK integrates with the Amplitude Browser SDK via `amplitude.add(window.engagement.plugin())` and supports third-party analytics providers like Segment and Google Tag Manager.

Key SDK methods include:
- `engagement.init()` and `engagement.boot()` for initialization
- `engagement.gs.show()`, `engagement.gs.reset()`, `engagement.gs.list()`, `engagement.gs.closeAll()` for guide management
- `setThemeMode()`, `addCallback()`, `setRouter()`, `updateLanguage()` for customization

The platform supports proxy configurations through AWS CloudFront with dual origins (cdn.amplitude.com for static assets, gs.amplitude.com for API requests with /sdk/ prefix) to circumvent domain blocking.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Lifecycle UUID**: Unique identifier for tracking user interactions across guide/survey sessions
**Step ID/Step Index**: Sequential identifiers for multi-step experiences
**Variant ID**: A/B testing identifier for experiment tracking
**Strike Detection**: Behavioral trigger mechanism with rate-limiting
**Smart Delay**: Intelligent timing trigger based on user behavior patterns
**Rage Click**: Detection system for user frustration indicators
**Microscope Integration**: Session replay functionality for detailed user interaction analysis
**Recommendation Sets**: Customizable content collections for Resource Center personalization
**Autopilot**: Automated content recommendation system using semantic search

## Targeting and Experimentation

The platform provides sophisticated targeting capabilities through user segmentation (All Users vs Targeted Users with property/cohort filtering), trigger conditions (element appearance/clicks, time delays, smart delay, rage click, user confusion, event tracking), and page targeting rules using CSS selectors and XPath expressions. Priority levels (Urgent/High/Medium/Low) with tiebreaker logic manage multiple eligible experiences.

Amplitude Experiment integration enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, with variant configuration, exposure event handling, and comprehensive analytics through the insights dashboard. The system tracks experiment exposure events and provides performance metrics including completion rates and time-based analysis.

## Analytics and Insights

The platform generates comprehensive analytics through Amplitude events including Guide Engaged, Guide Step Completed, Survey Submitted, Survey Abandoned, and Tooltip Marker Viewed. The analytics system provides aggregate data analysis with type-specific insights (NPS scoring with promoters/detractors/passives classification), filtering capabilities, and time-based engagement charts with rolling window analysis (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly).

Individual response analysis is available through the Responses tab with sorting, filtering, and column pinning capabilities. Real-time interaction feeds and rage close percentage tracking provide immediate user behavior insights.

## Customization and Localization

The Themes system enables comprehensive branding customization through the Theme Editor with Brand controls and Component editor sections, supporting accent colors, Google Fonts typography, form controls styling, widget dimensions, CSS properties configuration, and animation settings. Platform-specific themes support both web and mobile implementations.

Localization functionality supports multilingual content through SDK locale initialization, Project settings language configuration, and translation workflows using both web interface and .xliff file methods. The system provides locale code language resolution with translation fallback behavior.

## Permissions and Access Control

The platform implements a three-tier permission system (Viewer, Member, Manager) that overrides base Amplitude user roles, providing granular access control for viewing, editing drafts, publishing, and running experiments. The system supports per-project role assignment through the Guides and Surveys > Permissions interface with five access levels: No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, and Administrator.

## Content Management

The Resource Center supports multiple content sources including documentation repositories and video content with Website scraper functionality for URL extraction through direct URLs or CSV/XML sitemap upload. Advanced filtering options include URL path inclusion/exclusion and content selector overrides for targeting specific page elements. The system provides sync error management with Force Sync and Publish capabilities for automatically excluded pages.
