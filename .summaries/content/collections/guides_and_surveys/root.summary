Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to improve user onboarding, engagement, and feedback collection. The platform enables product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams to create contextual, interactive experiences that drive retention, activation, and engagement metrics through targeted user communication within applications.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The platform consists of three core product areas that work together to create comprehensive user experiences:

**Guides** provide interactive user onboarding and engagement through five form factors: Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner, and Checklist. These guides support multi-step navigation, conditional logic, and various interactive blocks including buttons, images, and videos. Guide templates include Tours for step-by-step instructions, Announcements for feature updates, Checklists for task completion, Banners for persistent messaging, and Tooltips for contextual help.

**Surveys** enable targeted feedback collection using four block types: Rating (Stars, NPS, Emoji, Rating labels), Long answer, Short answer, and List blocks. Survey templates focus on NPS measurement, user feedback collection, and rating systems. Surveys support conditional logic for dynamic response paths and utilize a subset of guide form factors (modal, popover, pin).

**Resource Center** functions as a help widget that integrates with the Guides and Surveys SDK, providing search functionality, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. It features Autopilot functionality that uses semantic search to automatically generate content recommendations from documentation repositories.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Form Factors** define the visual presentation and interaction patterns:
- Modal: Full-screen overlay experiences
- Popover: Contextual bubbles attached to specific elements
- Pin: Persistent markers that expand on interaction
- Tooltip: Hover-triggered informational overlays
- Banner: Sticky horizontal messaging bars
- Checklist: Task-oriented completion interfaces

**Targeting and Triggers** control when and to whom experiences are shown:
- Element appearance/clicks using CSS Selector and XPath targeting
- Smart delay and time-based triggers
- Rage click and user confusion detection
- Event-based triggers through forwardEvent integration
- Segment-based user targeting with rollout percentages

**Analytics Properties** track user interactions through Amplitude events:
- Lifecycle UUID for session tracking
- Step ID and Step Index for navigation
- Variant ID for A/B testing
- Events include Viewed/Dismissed/Completed, Guide Engaged/Step Completed, Survey Submitted/Abandoned

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The platform integrates deeply with Amplitude's analytics ecosystem through the Amplitude Browser SDK and supports third-party analytics providers including Segment. **Amplitude Experiment** integration enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys with variant configuration and exposure event tracking.

**Microscope integration** provides session replay capabilities for analyzing user interactions with guides and surveys. The platform supports **localization** through SDK locale configuration, AI-powered translation via Claude, and XLIFF file workflows for multi-language content delivery.

## SDK Implementation and API Endpoints

The platform provides SDKs for multiple platforms:

**Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`):
- `engagement.init()` and `engagement.boot()` for initialization
- `engagement.gs.show()` and `engagement.gs.reset()` for guide management
- `engagement.forwardEvent()` for event tracking
- `engagement.setRouter()` for SPA routing support

**Mobile SDKs**:
- **iOS**: AmplitudeEngagement class with Swift Package Manager/CocoaPods installation
- **Android**: AmplitudeEngagement with gradle dependencies, requiring API Level 24+
- **React Native**: `@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native` with deep linking support

**Key API Patterns**:
- `/sdk/*` path pattern for API routing through proxy configurations
- Preview mode endpoints like `/sdk/admin/config`
- Custom URL schemes for mobile preview mode integration

## Advanced Features and Configuration

**Experimentation** capabilities include variant configuration, experiment management workflows, and performance analytics through the Insights dashboard. **Proxy configuration** supports AWS CloudFront setup with specific cache behaviors for cdn.amplitude.com (static assets) and gs.amplitude.com (API requests).

**Permission system** provides granular access control with five levels: No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, and Administrator, each with specific capabilities for viewing, editing, publishing, and running experiments.

**Content management** includes template systems for reusable starting points, tag-based organization, bulk operations, and comprehensive testing through preview mode with condition verification and live testing capabilities using cohort targeting.

The platform's **Theme Editor** enables comprehensive branding customization including colors, typography, form controls, animations, and platform-specific styling, while **personalization variables** allow dynamic insertion of client-side user properties with fallback value support.
