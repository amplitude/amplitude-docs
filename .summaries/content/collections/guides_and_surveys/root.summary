## Amplitude Guides and Surveys SDK

Amplitude's Guides and Surveys SDK is a comprehensive user engagement platform that enables developers to create and deploy interactive experiences directly within web applications. The SDK serves as a bridge between user analytics and actionable engagement, providing tools for onboarding, feedback collection, and contextual user guidance through data-driven messaging campaigns.

## Product Architecture and Form Factor Ecosystem

The SDK is built around six core form factors, each engineered for specific engagement patterns and user interaction contexts:

**Banner** serves as persistent messaging infrastructure, positioning content at page boundaries (top/bottom) for ongoing visibility without disrupting core application workflows. **Modal** provides full-screen overlay capabilities for high-priority communications requiring complete user attention and interaction commitment.

**Popover** delivers contextual messaging that dynamically positions adjacent to specific UI elements, enabling just-in-time guidance tied to user interface components. **Tooltip** offers lightweight informational overlays for micro-interactions and feature explanations. **Pin** creates anchored visual indicators that highlight specific features or interface areas for discovery and navigation assistance.

**Checklist** implements task-oriented interfaces designed for multi-step process guidance, particularly valuable for complex onboarding sequences and feature adoption workflows.

## Survey and Data Collection Framework

The SDK incorporates sophisticated survey capabilities supporting multiple input methodologies:

- **Rating Systems**: Numerical and visual rating interfaces for satisfaction scoring and preference collection
- **Selection Controls**: Checkbox and radio button implementations for multiple choice and single-selection scenarios  
- **Text Input Collection**: Open-ended feedback mechanisms for qualitative data gathering
- **Call-to-Action (CTA) Integration**: Behavioral trigger buttons that drive specific user actions and conversion events

## Technical Implementation and Customization

### CSS Architecture and Styling Framework

The SDK implements a comprehensive CSS customization system built on structured class hierarchies. All styling elements utilize the `amplitude-engagement` namespace prefix, ensuring clean separation from application stylesheets and preventing CSS conflicts.

**Container Classes** provide form factor-specific styling targets:
- `amplitude-engagement-banner-container` for banner implementations
- `amplitude-engagement-modal-overlay` for modal experiences
- Form factor-specific containers for popover, tooltip, pin, and checklist variants

**Element-Level Targeting** enables granular component styling through dedicated selectors for rating inputs, checkbox controls, radio button groups, and CTA button elements. This granular approach supports precise brand alignment and design system integration.

**Form Factor Isolation** ensures CSS scope separation, allowing distinct styling approaches across different engagement types without cross-contamination or inheritance conflicts.

### Platform Constraints and Development Status

The custom CSS functionality operates under specific technical limitations:
- **Web SDK Exclusivity**: Custom styling capabilities are currently restricted to web implementations only
- **Beta Classification**: The feature maintains beta status, indicating active development cycles and potential API evolution

## Product Ecosystem Integration and Enterprise Positioning

The Guides and Surveys SDK functions as a core component within Amplitude's broader engagement and analytics ecosystem. The platform leverages Amplitude's underlying analytics infrastructure to deliver targeted, data-driven user experiences that respond to behavioral patterns and user segmentation.

The sophisticated CSS architecture and form factor organization indicate enterprise-scale deployment capabilities, supporting organizations requiring consistent brand implementation across complex engagement campaigns. The structured approach to styling and component organization suggests integration pathways with existing design systems and brand guideline frameworks.

The SDK's positioning within Amplitude's product suite enables seamless data flow between user analytics, behavioral insights, and engagement execution, creating closed-loop optimization cycles for user experience improvement and conversion optimization initiatives.
