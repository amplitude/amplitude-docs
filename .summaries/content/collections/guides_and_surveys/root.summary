Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that replaces traditional popup systems with sophisticated, contextual engagement tools. The platform enables product teams to create targeted onboarding experiences, collect user feedback, and provide contextual help directly within applications to improve user retention, activation, and engagement.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform operates through three interconnected components that deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** serve as interactive, multi-step experiences for user onboarding, feature announcements, and product tours. The system supports five distinct form factors: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual bubbles), Pin (persistent sidebar elements), Tooltip (contextual markers), Banner (top/bottom notifications), and Checklist (task-oriented workflows). Each form factor provides extensive customization including position controls, z-index configuration, text animations with typewriter effects, and advanced trigger mechanisms.

**Surveys** focus on feedback collection through four specialized block types: Rating blocks supporting Stars, NPS, Emoji, and custom Rating labels; Long answer blocks for detailed responses; Short answer blocks for brief inputs; and List blocks for multiple choice selections. The survey system implements conditional logic for dynamic response paths and leverages the same targeting mechanisms as guides.

**Resource Center** functions as an intelligent help widget that integrates with external documentation repositories. It provides contextual assistance through semantic search, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. The Resource Center features an Autopilot system that automatically generates content recommendations using semantic search algorithms.

## Advanced Targeting and Behavioral Intelligence

The platform implements sophisticated targeting through the Setup and Targeting system. User targeting supports both broad "All Users" deployment and granular "Targeted Users" segmentation using property filtering and cohort analysis. Trigger conditions include element appearance detection, click tracking, time-based delays, smart delay algorithms, rage click detection, and user confusion identification.

Page targeting utilizes URL matching patterns with CSS selector and XPath expression support, while the visual selector tool enables precise element targeting without technical knowledge. The system implements priority levels (Urgent/High/Medium/Low) with tiebreaker logic for managing multiple eligible experiences, plus display limits and cooldown periods to prevent user fatigue.

## Multi-Platform SDK Ecosystem

Amplitude provides comprehensive SDK support across platforms:

**Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with Amplitude Browser SDK, third-party analytics providers like Segment, and Google Tag Manager. Key methods include `engagement.init()`, `engagement.boot()`, `forwardEvent()` for event-based triggers, `setThemeMode()` for theme management, and `updateLanguage()` for localization.

**Mobile SDKs** support iOS (Swift Package Manager/CocoaPods with `AmplitudeEngagement`), Android (gradle dependencies with `AmplitudeEngagement` class), and React Native (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`). Mobile implementations include deep linking support, screen tracking capabilities, and element targeting through accessibility identifiers.

## Analytics and Experimentation Framework

The platform integrates deeply with Amplitude's analytics ecosystem, tracking comprehensive event properties including Lifecycle UUID, Step ID, Variant ID for A/B testing, and specific events like Guide Completed, Survey Submitted, and Tooltip Marker Viewed. The analytics glossary defines a complete taxonomy of trackable interactions.

**Amplitude Experiment integration** enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, with variant configuration, exposure event handling, and insights dashboard analytics. The experimentation framework supports treatment vs control groups with configurable rollout percentages.

**Survey Analysis** provides aggregate insights through the Insights tab with NPS scoring (promoters/detractors/passives), type-specific breakdowns, and time-based engagement charts with Microscope integration for session replay analysis. The Responses tab enables individual user response analysis with advanced sorting and filtering capabilities.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Lifecycle UUID**: Unique identifier tracking individual user journeys through guides and surveys
**Step ID**: Identifier for specific steps within multi-step experiences
**Variant ID**: Identifier for A/B testing variations
**Autopilot**: Automated content recommendation system using semantic search
**Microscope**: Session replay integration for detailed user behavior analysis
**Cooldown periods**: Time-based restrictions preventing experience fatigue
**Rage click detection**: Behavioral trigger identifying user frustration patterns
**Smart delay algorithms**: Intelligent timing mechanisms for optimal experience delivery

## Localization and Content Management

The platform supports enterprise-grade localization through XLIFF file-based translation workflows, SDK locale initialization, and Project Settings language configuration. The system provides fallback behavior and multilingual preview capabilities for global deployments.

**Content sourcing** for Resource Center supports multiple methods including documentation repository sync, video integration, and Website scraper functionality. The scraper can extract content through direct URLs or CSV/XML sitemap uploads, with advanced filtering options and content selectors for targeting specific page elements.

## Theming and Customization

The comprehensive Themes system allows complete branding customization through the Theme Editor, featuring Brand controls and Component editor sections. Customizable elements include accent colors, Google Fonts typography, form controls styling, widget dimensions for all form factors, CSS properties configuration, animation settings, and platform-specific theme deployment.

## Permission and Access Control

The platform implements role-based permissions with five access levels: No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, and Administrator. These roles override base Amplitude user permissions to provide granular control over viewing, editing, publishing guides/surveys, and running experiments within the Guides and Surveys module.

## Technical Integration Features

Advanced technical capabilities include Content Security Policy (CSP) directive support, Single Page Application (SPA) router configuration, proxy setup through AWS CloudFront for domain blocking circumvention, and comprehensive callback systems for custom button actions. The platform supports both EU and US server zones with configurable endpoints.

The testing framework provides preview mode functionality with condition verification (trigger, limit, throttle), troubleshooting tools, and live testing through cohort targeting, enabling thorough validation before production deployment.

## Broader Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Guides and Surveys integrates seamlessly with the broader Amplitude product ecosystem, leveraging Amplitude Analytics for user segmentation and behavioral data, Amplitude Experiment for A/B testing capabilities, and Amplitude's cohort system for advanced targeting. The platform serves as the engagement layer that acts on insights derived from Amplitude's analytics platform, creating a closed-loop system where data drives personalized user experiences that generate additional behavioral data for analysis.
