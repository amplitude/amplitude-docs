Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user engagement platform that replaces traditional popups with contextual, non-intrusive messaging experiences. The platform enables product, growth, and product marketing teams to create sophisticated user onboarding flows, collect targeted feedback, and improve key metrics like retention, activation, and engagement through intelligent, behavior-driven interactions.

## Core Product Components

The platform operates through three interconnected components that form a unified engagement ecosystem:

**Guides** serve as the primary onboarding and feature discovery mechanism, offering six distinct template types: Tour (multi-step walkthroughs), Announcement (single-step notifications), Checklists (task completion tracking), Carousel (swipeable content sequences), Banners (persistent messaging), and Tooltips (contextual help). These guides leverage behavioral triggers, strike detection algorithms, and sophisticated rate-limiting to ensure optimal timing and frequency.

**Surveys** function as the feedback collection engine, utilizing four specialized block types: Rating blocks (Stars, NPS, Emoji, Rating labels), Long answer, Short answer, and List blocks. The survey system supports conditional logic for dynamic response branching and deploys across modal, popover, and pin form factors. Analytics capabilities include NPS breakdowns, response aggregation, and individual user tracking with CSV export functionality supporting up to 10,000 responses.

**Resource Center** operates as an intelligent help widget that integrates external documentation repositories with advanced search functionality. It features an Autopilot system utilizing semantic search algorithms to automatically generate article recommendations by analyzing page content, serving as an intelligent fallback when dedicated recommendation sets aren't configured.

## Form Factor Architecture and Customization

The platform supports five primary form factors with extensive customization capabilities: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual containers), Pin (targeted page elements), Tooltip (contextual help), Banner (persistent messaging), and Checklist (task tracking). Each form factor supports advanced positioning, layout controls, z-index management, text animations including typewriter effects, and interactive content blocks.

Content blocks accommodate various media types including YouTube, Vimeo, Loom, Vidyard, and MP4 videos. Button actions encompass visit link, click element, show guide/survey, callback functions, and app store rating requests. The Theme Editor provides comprehensive styling through Brand controls and Component editor sections, enabling customization of colors, typography, form controls, cards, widget dimensions, and animations.

## Multi-Platform SDK Implementation

**Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with Amplitude Browser SDK 2.0, third-party analytics providers like Segment, and Google Tag Manager. Core methods include `engagement.init()`, `engagement.boot()`, `engagement.gs.show()`, and `engagement.gs.reset()`. The SDK supports Content Security Policy (CSP) nonce, single-page application routing via `setRouter()`, custom actions through `addCallback()`, and desktop app previewing using `_startNudgeDebug()`.

**iOS SDK** (Amplitude-Engagement-Swift) supports Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods installation, requiring Swift 5.9 and iOS 15+. Implementation utilizes `AmplitudeEngagement` class with `AmplitudeBootOptions`, screen tracking via `amplitudeEngagement.screen()`, and element targeting through `accessibilityIdentifier` and `amplitudeView` modifier.

**Android SDK** (`amplitude-engagement-android`) requires Android API Level 24+ and Kotlin 1.8.22+, supporting Jetpack Compose through `.amplitudeView` modifier and traditional views using `contentDescription` and `tag` selectors. Configuration uses `AmplitudeEngagement` class with `AmplitudeBootOptions` and `AmplitudeEndUser`.

**React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) integrates with `@amplitude/analytics-react-native`, supporting deep linking through `handleURL()` method and URL scheme configuration.

## Advanced Targeting and Personalization

The targeting system provides sophisticated user segmentation capabilities including All Users vs Targeted Users with cohort integration, rollout percentages with bucketing units, and comprehensive trigger mechanisms. Triggers encompass element appearance/clicks (CSS Selector and XPath), time delays, smart delay, rage click detection, user confusion detection, and event tracking integration.

Page targeting supports URL matching patterns and query parameters, while session properties can be configured via `setSessionProperty()`. The Personalize with Variables feature dynamically inserts client-side user properties into guide and survey text blocks with fallback value support.

Priority levels (Urgent, High, Medium, Low) control display precedence with tiebreaker logic for active state management. Display limits and cooldown periods prevent over-engagement, while localization support enables multi-language content delivery through SDK locale configuration, XLIFF file workflows, and AI-powered translation using Claude.

## Analytics Integration and Experimentation

Comprehensive analytics tracking integrates with Amplitude through events prefixed `[Guides-Surveys]`. Event properties include App Type (ios, android, react native, web), Lifecycle UUID, Step ID, Variant ID, and Source.type (nudge, trigger, sdk, share_link). Tracked events include Guide Viewed/Completed/Dismissed, Survey Submitted/Abandoned/Response, and Resource Center interactions.

Amplitude Experiment integration enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys. Experiment management includes variant configuration, exposure event handling, and insights dashboard analytics with treatment vs control tracking and time-based engagement analysis.

Survey analysis features an Insights tab for aggregate metrics and trends with NPS-specific breakdowns, and a Responses tab for individual user response data. Microscope integration provides session replay capabilities for deeper behavioral analysis.

## Enterprise Features and Permission Management

A five-tier permission system (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) provides granular access control that overrides base Amplitude user roles, controlling viewing, editing drafts, publishing, and experiment execution within the Guides and Surveys module.

Enterprise capabilities include throttling configuration for controlling artifact appearance frequency through configurable limits and time periods (day/week/month/session), with separate settings for guides versus surveys. Custom CSS styling support (web SDK only, beta) provides advanced customization through CSS class selectors.

The platform supports proxy configuration through AWS CloudFront for unified distribution with specific cache behaviors, and includes comprehensive localization features available on Growth and Enterprise plans with support for multiple languages, fallback behavior configuration, and translation workflows.

Content management features include template functionality for reusable starting points, tagging systems for organization, preview mode for testing trigger conditions, and live testing capabilities using cohort targeting for real-world validation.
