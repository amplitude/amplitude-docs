Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to enhance user onboarding, collect feedback, and improve retention, activation, and engagement metrics. The platform enables product, growth, and product marketing teams to create targeted, contextual experiences directly within their applications.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of three primary components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** are interactive, multi-step experiences designed for user onboarding and product exploration. They support five distinct form factors: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual bubbles), Pin (anchored elements), Tooltip (contextual hints), Banner (persistent notifications), and Checklist (task-oriented workflows). Guides utilize behavioral triggers including element appearance/clicks, time delays, rage clicks, user confusion detection, and custom event tracking.

**Surveys** focus on feedback collection through four specialized block types: Rating blocks (supporting Stars, NPS, Emoji, and custom Rating labels), Long answer blocks for detailed responses, Short answer blocks for brief input, and List blocks for multiple choice options. Surveys support conditional logic for dynamic response branching and can be deployed using Modal, Popover, and Pin form factors.

**Resource Center** functions as a help widget that integrates external documentation repositories, provides search functionality, displays recommended content, and offers quick links with call-to-action buttons. It features an Autopilot system that uses semantic search algorithms to automatically surface relevant articles based on page content analysis.

## SDK Implementation and Platform Support

The platform provides comprehensive SDK support across multiple platforms through dedicated packages:

- **Web SDK**: `@amplitude/engagement-browser` with integration support for Amplitude Browser SDK, third-party analytics providers like Segment, and Google Tag Manager
- **iOS SDK**: `Amplitude-Engagement-Swift` supporting Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods installation
- **Android SDK**: `amplitude-engagement-android` with Jetpack Compose support via `.amplitudeView` modifier
- **React Native SDK**: `@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native` with deep linking configuration

All SDKs share common initialization patterns using `AmplitudeEngagement` classes with `boot()` and `init()` methods, supporting user/device ID configuration, screen tracking, element targeting, and theme management.

## Targeting and Personalization System

The platform employs a sophisticated targeting system that combines multiple layers of user segmentation:

**User Targeting** supports cohort-based segmentation, custom user properties, and session properties set via `setSessionProperty()`. **Page Targeting** uses URL matching patterns with inclusion/exclusion rules. **Behavioral Triggers** include CSS selector and XPath-based element targeting, time-based delays, rage click detection, and custom event tracking through `forwardEvent()` methods.

**Priority Management** operates through four levels (urgent, high, medium, low) with tiebreaker rules for simultaneous content. **Display Controls** include rollout percentage bucketing, cooldown periods, and dismissable/snoozable settings.

## Content Management and Localization

The platform supports comprehensive content management through a web-based interface with **Template System** for creating reusable starting points, **Tag Organization** for campaign and feature-based categorization, and **Status Management** with draft, published, and scheduled states.

**Localization** is handled through SDK locale configuration with `locale` parameters, supporting XLIFF file translation workflows, AI-powered localization using Claude, and fallback behavior configuration. Content can be personalized using the "Personalize with Variables" feature that dynamically inserts client-side user properties into text blocks.

## Analytics and Experimentation

The platform provides detailed analytics through structured event schemas including:

**Guide Events**: Guide Viewed, Guide Completed, Guide Dismissed, Guide Engaged, Guide Rage Closed, Tooltip Marker Viewed, Pin Target Not Found
**Survey Events**: Survey Submitted, Survey Abandoned, Survey Completed, Survey Step Completed

All events include common properties like Lifecycle UUID for event grouping, Step ID and Step Index for navigation tracking, and Variant ID for A/B testing support.

**Experiment Integration** with Amplitude Experiment enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, with variant configuration, exposure event handling, and insights dashboard analytics for treatment vs control performance tracking.

## Advanced Features and Customization

**Theme System** provides comprehensive branding control through a Theme Editor with Brand controls and Component editor sections, supporting accent color customization, Google Fonts typography, form control styling, widget dimensions, CSS properties configuration, and animation settings.

**Custom CSS** support (web SDK only, beta feature) allows targeting of form factor containers and survey elements using `amplitude-engagement` CSS classes for advanced styling customization.

**Proxy Configuration** supports AWS CloudFront reverse proxy setup with dual origins (cdn.amplitude.com for static assets, gs.amplitude.com for API requests) and specific cache behaviors including the critical `/sdk/*` path pattern for API routing.

## Permission System and User Management

The platform implements a five-tier permission system (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) that overrides base Amplitude user roles, providing granular access control for viewing, editing drafts, publishing content, and running experiments within the Guides and Surveys module.

## Resource Center Advanced Capabilities

The Resource Center extends beyond basic help functionality through **Website Scraper** capabilities for URL extraction via direct URLs or CSV/XML sitemap upload, **Content Selector Overrides** for targeting specific page elements, and **Recommendation Sets** that create customizable in-time articles with various action types including visit link, click element, run callback, open third-party chat, show guide/survey, open article, and play video.

The platform integrates seamlessly with existing analytics infrastructure while providing specialized tooling for in-product user experience optimization, making it a comprehensive solution for modern product teams seeking to improve user engagement and satisfaction through contextual, targeted interactions.
