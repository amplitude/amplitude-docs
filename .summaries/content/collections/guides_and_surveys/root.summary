Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to improve user retention, activation, and engagement through targeted onboarding experiences and feedback collection. The platform enables product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams to create contextual, interactive experiences directly within their applications.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of three primary components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** are interactive, multi-step experiences designed for user onboarding and product education. They support five distinct form factors: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual bubbles), Pin (persistent sidebar elements), Tooltip (contextual markers), Banner (top/bottom page notifications), and Checklist (task-oriented workflows). Guides utilize behavioral triggers including element appearance/clicks, time delays, smart delay, rage click detection, user confusion detection, and event tracking to deliver contextually relevant experiences.

**Surveys** focus on feedback collection through four specialized block types: Rating blocks (supporting Stars, NPS, Emoji, and Rating labels), Long answer blocks for detailed responses, Short answer blocks for brief inputs, and List blocks for multiple choice selections. Surveys support conditional logic for dynamic response paths and can be deployed using Modal, Popover, and Pin form factors.

**Resource Center** functions as an intelligent help widget that integrates external documentation repositories, provides semantic search capabilities, and delivers personalized content recommendations through its Autopilot feature. It supports various action types including visit link, click element, run callback, open third-party chat, show guide/survey, open article, and play video.

## Technical Implementation and SDK Integration

The platform provides comprehensive SDK support across multiple platforms through dedicated packages:

- **Web SDK**: `@amplitude/engagement-browser` with methods like `engagement.init()`, `engagement.boot()`, and integration support for third-party analytics providers, Google Tag Manager, and Single Page Applications
- **iOS SDK**: `AmplitudeEngagement` with Swift Package Manager/CocoaPods installation, supporting iOS 15+ and Swift 5.9+
- **Android SDK**: `amplitude-engagement-android` requiring Android API Level 24+ and Kotlin 1.8.22+
- **React Native SDK**: `@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native` with deep linking support via `handleURL()`

Key SDK methods include `show()`, `reset()`, `list()`, `closeAll()` for guide/survey control, `forwardEvent()` for event-based triggers, `setThemeMode()` for theme management, and `updateLanguage()` for localization.

## Advanced Features and Capabilities

**Experimentation Integration**: The platform integrates with Amplitude Experiment to support A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, with variant configuration, exposure event tracking, and performance analytics through the Insights dashboard.

**Targeting and Personalization**: Sophisticated targeting capabilities include user segmentation through properties and cohorts, page targeting with URL matching patterns, CSS selector and XPath element targeting, priority levels (Urgent/High/Medium/Low), display limits with cooldown periods, and tiebreaker logic for multiple eligible experiences.

**Localization Support**: Comprehensive internationalization through SDK locale initialization, XLIFF translation file workflows, Project Settings language configuration, and fallback behavior management for multilingual deployments.

**Analytics and Insights**: Deep analytics integration with Amplitude tracking, featuring events like Guide Completed, Survey Submitted, Tooltip Marker Viewed, with properties including Lifecycle UUID, Step ID, Variant ID for A/B testing, and Debug Mode filtering capabilities.

## Content Management and Workflow

**Theme System**: Centralized branding control through the Theme Editor with Brand controls and Component editor sections, supporting customization of colors, typography, form controls, widget dimensions, animations, and platform-specific themes for web and mobile.

**Permission Management**: Five-tier access control system (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) that overrides base Amplitude user roles, providing granular permissions for viewing, editing drafts, publishing, and running experiments.

**Content Sourcing**: Resource Center supports multiple content sources including documentation repositories, video integration, and Website scraper functionality with URL extraction methods, advanced filtering options, content selectors, and sync management capabilities.

**Testing and Preview**: Comprehensive testing framework with preview mode for condition verification (trigger, limit, throttle), troubleshooting tools, cohort targeting for live testing, and custom URL scheme support for mobile preview functionality.

The platform integrates seamlessly with the broader Amplitude ecosystem, leveraging existing user data, cohorts, and analytics infrastructure while providing specialized tools for in-product user experience optimization. Proxy configuration support through AWS CloudFront enables deployment in environments with domain restrictions, ensuring broad accessibility across different organizational security requirements.
