Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user engagement platform that replaces traditional popup systems with contextual, non-intrusive messaging experiences. The platform empowers product, growth, and product marketing teams to enhance user onboarding, collect feedback, and improve key metrics including retention, activation, and engagement through sophisticated behavioral targeting and personalization.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform operates through three interconnected components that deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** serve as interactive, multi-step experiences optimized for user onboarding and feature exploration. They support six distinct form factors (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner, Checklist) and leverage behavioral triggers, strike detection, and rate-limiting mechanisms. The system provides pre-built templates including Tour, Announcement, Checklists, Carousel, Banners, and Tooltips, each designed for specific use cases ranging from comprehensive step-by-step onboarding to contextual help delivery.

**Surveys** focus on feedback collection and user sentiment analysis through four specialized block types (Rating, Long answer, Short answer, List) with conditional logic enabling dynamic response branching. Survey templates encompass NPS, User feedback, Rating, Carousel, Banner Survey, and Tooltip Survey configurations, supported by specialized analytics for NPS scoring and response aggregation.

**Resource Center** functions as an intelligent help widget that integrates external documentation repositories with advanced search functionality, recommended content delivery, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. The component features an Autopilot system utilizing semantic search algorithms to automatically surface relevant articles through page content analysis.

## Multi-Platform SDK Integration

The platform provides comprehensive SDK support across multiple development environments:

- **Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with Amplitude Browser SDK 2.0, third-party analytics providers like Segment, and Google Tag Manager
- **iOS SDK** (`Amplitude-Engagement-Swift`) supports Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods installation with iOS 15+ requirements
- **Android SDK** (`amplitude-engagement-android`) supports Jetpack Compose and traditional Android views with API Level 24+ requirements
- **React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) provides cross-platform mobile support with deep linking capabilities

## Advanced Targeting and Personalization

The platform delivers sophisticated targeting through multiple mechanisms:

**Behavioral Triggers** include element appearance/clicks, time delays, rage clicks, user confusion detection, and comprehensive event tracking. **User Segmentation** enables precise audience targeting through demographic and behavioral criteria. **Session Properties** can be dynamically set via `setSessionProperty()` for real-time personalization. **Page Targeting** supports URL matching patterns and regex expressions for contextual content delivery.

## Analytics Integration and Event Schema

Complete integration with Amplitude analytics includes a comprehensive event schema featuring common event properties (App Type, Lifecycle UUID, Step ID, Variant ID), guide-specific events (Guide Viewed, Guide Completed, Guide Engaged), survey events (Survey Submitted, Survey Abandoned), and Resource Center interaction tracking. This enables detailed performance analysis and optimization of engagement campaigns.

## Experimentation and A/B Testing

Native integration with Amplitude Experiment enables sophisticated A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys. The system supports variant configuration, exposure event handling, and comprehensive performance analytics through the insights dashboard, allowing teams to optimize engagement strategies based on data-driven insights.

## Content Management and Customization

**Template System** provides reusable starting points for guides and surveys with visibility management, bulk operations, and tag-based organization. Content lifecycle management supports draft/published/scheduled states with rollout percentage controls for gradual deployment.

**Theme Editor** offers comprehensive branding control over colors, typography (Google Fonts integration), form controls, widget dimensions, animations, and platform-specific styling. Custom CSS support is available for web SDK implementations with specific class selectors for targeting form factors and survey elements.

**Throttling and Rate Limiting** provides global and granular controls including limit/period settings, time delays between sequential guides, and advanced tag-based throttling for different content categories (campaigns, features, teams).

## Localization and Multi-Language Support

The platform supports multi-language implementations through SDK locale initialization, project-level language configuration, and fallback behavior settings. Three translation methods are available: web interface management, AI localization with Claude integration, and XLIFF file upload workflows for enterprise translation management.

## Testing and Quality Assurance

Preview mode enables comprehensive condition verification (trigger, limit, throttle) before launch. Troubleshooting capabilities include Reset User History, Ignore Throttle Limits, and manual event triggering for thorough testing workflows, ensuring optimal user experiences before deployment.

## Enterprise Integration

The platform integrates seamlessly into existing product ecosystems through proxy configurations (AWS CloudFront support), Content Security Policy compliance, and extensive callback systems for custom business logic integration. This enables enterprise-grade deployment while maintaining security and performance standards.
