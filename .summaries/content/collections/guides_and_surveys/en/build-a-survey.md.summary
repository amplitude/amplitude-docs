**Summary:** This documentation covers building surveys with four unique block types (Rating, Long answer, Short answer, List) that support conditional logic for dynamic response branching, using a subset of guide form factors (modal, popover, pin) with specific settings like NPS scoring, ARIA labels, pre-fill keys, and multiple choice options.
