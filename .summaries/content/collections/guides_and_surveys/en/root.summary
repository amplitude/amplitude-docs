Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user engagement platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to enhance user onboarding, collect feedback, and improve retention, activation, and engagement metrics. The platform enables product, growth, and product marketing teams to create contextual, interactive experiences directly within their applications.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of three primary components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** are interactive, multi-step experiences that help users navigate through product features and complete tasks. They support five distinct form factors: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual bubbles), Pin (anchored markers), Tooltip (hover information), Banner (persistent notifications), and Checklist (task completion tracking). Guides utilize behavioral triggers, strike detection, and rate-limiting mechanisms to ensure optimal user experience.

**Surveys** focus on feedback collection through four specialized block types: Rating (Stars, NPS, Emoji, Rating labels), Long answer, Short answer, and List (multiple choice). Surveys support conditional logic for dynamic response branching and can be deployed using a subset of guide form factors (modal, popover, pin).

**Resource Center** functions as an intelligent help widget that integrates with the Guides and Surveys SDK, providing search functionality, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. It features an Autopilot system that uses semantic search algorithms to automatically generate article recommendations by analyzing page content and surfacing relevant materials from content repositories.

## Key Features and Capabilities

The platform offers extensive customization through its **Themes** system, allowing modification of branding elements including colors, typography, form controls, cards, widget dimensions, and animations via a Theme Editor with Brand controls and Component editor sections. **Localization** support enables serving content in multiple languages through SDK locale configuration, with AI-powered translation capabilities and XLIFF file workflow support.

**Targeting and Personalization** capabilities include sophisticated user segmentation, trigger conditions (element appearance/clicks, time delays, rage clicks, user confusion, event tracking), session properties, page targeting with URL matching patterns, and priority levels. The system supports **Personalize with Variables** functionality to dynamically insert client-side user properties into content with fallback values.

**Analytics and Experimentation** integration with Amplitude Experiment enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, with comprehensive event tracking including Guide Viewed, Guide Completed, Guide Dismissed, Survey Submitted, Survey Abandoned, and Survey Completed events. The analytics schema includes properties like Lifecycle UUID, Step ID, Variant ID, and engagement metrics.

## Technical Implementation

The platform provides **Multi-Platform SDK Support** across Web (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`), iOS (AmplitudeEngagement with Swift Package Manager/CocoaPods), Android (amplitude-engagement-android with Jetpack Compose support), and React Native (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`). 

**Web SDK** offers comprehensive integration options including Amplitude Browser SDK plugin integration, third-party analytics providers (Segment), Google Tag Manager template, and methods like `engagement.init()`, `engagement.boot()`, `engagement.forwardEvent()`, `engagement.setThemeMode()`, and `engagement.gs.show()`.

**Mobile SDKs** support element targeting through platform-specific approaches: iOS uses `accessibilityIdentifier` and `amplitudeView` modifier, while Android utilizes `.amplitudeView` modifier for Jetpack Compose and `contentDescription`/tag selectors for traditional views. Both platforms support screen tracking, theme management, and preview mode configuration with custom URL schemes.

## Content Management and Organization

The platform includes robust **Content Management** features with template systems for creating reusable starting points, tags for organizing guides and surveys, and bulk operations for efficient management. **Testing and Preview** capabilities allow verification of trigger, limit, and throttle conditions before launch, with troubleshooting tools and live testing using cohort targeting.

**Throttling Configuration** controls the rate and frequency of guide/survey appearances through configurable limits and time periods (day/week/month/session), with separate settings for guides versus surveys to optimize user experience.

## Access Control and Permissions

A comprehensive **Role-Based Permission System** provides five access levels (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) with specific capabilities for viewing, editing, publishing guides/surveys, and running experiments. This system overrides base Amplitude user roles to provide granular access control within the Guides and Surveys module.

## Infrastructure and Integration

The platform supports **Proxy Configuration** through AWS CloudFront for unified distribution with specific origins (cdn.amplitude.com for static assets, gs.amplitude.com for API requests) and critical `/sdk/*` path patterns for API routing. **Custom CSS** styling capabilities provide extensive customization options for form factors and survey elements, though currently limited to web SDK as a beta feature.

The Resource Center's **Website Scraper** functionality enables automatic content extraction from documentation repositories using URL extraction methods, CSV/XML sitemap upload, advanced filtering with URL path inclusion/exclusion, and content selector overrides for targeting specific page elements.
