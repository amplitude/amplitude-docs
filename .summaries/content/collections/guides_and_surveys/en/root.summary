Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to improve user onboarding, engagement, and feedback collection. The platform enables product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams to create contextual, interactive experiences that drive retention, activation, and engagement metrics through targeted user communication within applications.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The platform consists of three core product areas that work together to create a unified user experience system:

**Guides** provide interactive user onboarding and engagement through five distinct form factors: Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner, and Checklist. Each form factor supports multi-step functionality with customizable content blocks including buttons, images, and videos. Guides utilize behavioral triggers, strike detection, and rate-limiting mechanisms to ensure appropriate user targeting. Five template types are available: Tours for step-by-step instructions, Announcements for feature updates, Checklists for task completion, Banners for persistent messaging, and Tooltips for contextual help.

**Surveys** enable targeted feedback collection through four unique block types: Rating (with Stars, NPS, Emoji, and Rating labels), Long answer, Short answer, and List blocks. Surveys support conditional logic for dynamic response paths and utilize a subset of guide form factors (modal, popover, pin). The system provides comprehensive analytics through the Insights tab for aggregate metrics and the Responses tab for individual user data with CSV export capabilities up to 10,000 responses.

**Resource Center** functions as a help widget that integrates with the Guides and Surveys SDK, providing search functionality, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. It features an Autopilot system that uses semantic search algorithms to automatically generate content recommendations from documentation repositories, serving as a smart fallback when manual recommendation sets aren't configured.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Lifecycle UUID**: Unique identifier for tracking user interactions across guide and survey sessions
**Step ID/Step Index**: Sequential identifiers for multi-step experiences
**Variant ID**: A/B testing identifier for experiment tracking
**Strike Detection**: System for identifying user interaction patterns
**Rate-limiting**: Throttling mechanism to control guide/survey frequency
**Form Factors**: The visual presentation modes (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner, Checklist)
**Behavioral Triggers**: Event-based conditions that initiate guide/survey display
**Recommendation Sets**: Curated content collections for Resource Center
**Semantic Search**: AI-powered content discovery algorithm
**Throttling**: Rate control system with configurable limits and time periods
**Smart Delay**: Intelligent timing mechanism for optimal user engagement
**Rage Click/User Confusion**: Advanced trigger mechanisms based on user behavior patterns

## SDK Integration and Technical Implementation

The platform supports multi-platform deployment through dedicated SDKs:

**Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`): Integrates with Amplitude Browser SDK, third-party analytics providers like Segment, and Google Tag Manager. Key methods include `engagement.init()`, `engagement.boot()`, `engagement.gs.show()`, and `engagement.gs.reset()`. Supports Content Security Policy (CSP) nonce, proxy configuration with `serverUrl` and `cdnUrl`, and SPA routing through `engagement.setRouter()`.

**iOS SDK** (`Amplitude-Engagement-Swift`): Requires Swift 5.9 and iOS 15+, supports Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods installation. Uses `AmplitudeEngagement` class with `accessibilityIdentifier` for element targeting and custom URL schemes for preview mode.

**Android SDK** (`amplitude-engagement-android`): Requires Android API Level 24+ and Kotlin 1.8.22+. Utilizes `AmplitudeEngagement` class with `AmplitudeBootOptions` and supports preview mode through AndroidManifest.xml intent filters.

**React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`): Integrates with async storage and provides deep linking support through `handleURL()` method.

## Analytics and Experimentation Framework

The platform provides comprehensive analytics through Amplitude integration, tracking events like Guide Engaged, Guide Step Completed, Survey Submitted, and Survey Abandoned. The Insights dashboard offers aggregate metrics with time-based analysis (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly) and integrates with Microscope for session replay analysis.

**Amplitude Experiment Integration** enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, with variant configuration, exposure event handling, and performance tracking. Experiments support treatment vs control groups with configurable rollout percentages.

## Advanced Features and Customization

**Localization** supports multiple languages through SDK locale configuration, AI-powered translation via Claude, and XLIFF file upload workflows. The system includes fallback behavior for unavailable or outdated translations.

**Themes** provide comprehensive branding customization through the Theme Editor, including Brand controls and Component editor sections for colors, typography, form controls, and animations.

**Personalization** enables dynamic content insertion through client-side user properties with fallback values when properties are unavailable.

**Targeting and Segmentation** offers sophisticated user targeting with segment-based rules, rollout percentages, bucketing units, and priority-based tiebreaker logic. Page targeting supports URL matching patterns with CSS selector and XPath targeting.

## Permissions and Access Control

The platform implements a three-tier permission system (Viewer, Member, Manager) that overrides base Amplitude user roles, providing granular access control for viewing, editing drafts, publishing, and running experiments within the Guides and Surveys module.

## Proxy Configuration and Enterprise Features

Enterprise deployments can utilize AWS CloudFront as a reverse proxy with specific origins (`cdn.amplitude.com` for static assets, `gs.amplitude.com` for API requests) and critical `/sdk/*` path patterns for API routing. The system supports both US and EU server zones for data residency compliance.
