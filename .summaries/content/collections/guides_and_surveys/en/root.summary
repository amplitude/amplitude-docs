## Amplitude Guides and Surveys SDK

Amplitude's Guides and Surveys SDK is a user engagement platform that enables developers to create and deploy interactive user experiences directly within their web applications. The SDK provides a comprehensive suite of engagement tools designed to guide users through onboarding flows, collect feedback, and drive user actions through contextual messaging.

## Core Features and Form Factors

The SDK supports six distinct form factors, each optimized for different engagement scenarios:

- **Banner**: Persistent messaging that appears at the top or bottom of the page
- **Modal**: Full-screen overlays that capture complete user attention
- **Popover**: Contextual messages that appear adjacent to specific UI elements
- **Tooltip**: Lightweight informational messages that provide just-in-time guidance
- **Pin**: Anchored indicators that highlight specific features or areas
- **Checklist**: Task-oriented interfaces that guide users through multi-step processes

## Survey Capabilities

The SDK includes robust survey functionality with support for multiple input types:
- Rating systems for collecting user satisfaction scores
- Checkbox and radio button selections for multiple choice questions
- Text inputs for open-ended feedback collection
- Call-to-action (CTA) buttons for driving specific user behaviors

## Technical Implementation

### CSS Customization Framework

The SDK provides extensive styling capabilities through a structured CSS class system. All engagement elements are prefixed with `amplitude-engagement` for clear namespace separation:

- **Container Classes**: Each form factor has dedicated container classes (e.g., `amplitude-engagement-banner-container`, `amplitude-engagement-modal-overlay`)
- **Element Targeting**: Granular CSS selectors enable precise styling of individual components like rating inputs, checkboxes, radio buttons, and CTA elements
- **Form Factor Isolation**: CSS classes are scoped to specific form factors, allowing for distinct styling approaches across different engagement types

### Platform Support and Limitations

The custom CSS functionality is currently:
- **Web SDK Only**: Custom styling capabilities are exclusively available for web implementations
- **Beta Status**: The feature is in beta, indicating ongoing development and potential API changes

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Guides and Surveys SDK operates as part of Amplitude's broader engagement platform, leveraging the company's analytics infrastructure to deliver targeted, data-driven user experiences. The SDK's CSS customization capabilities suggest integration with existing design systems and brand guidelines, allowing organizations to maintain visual consistency while deploying engagement campaigns.

The structured approach to CSS classes and form factor organization indicates this is designed for enterprise-scale deployments where consistent styling and maintainable code are critical requirements.
