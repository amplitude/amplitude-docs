Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to improve user retention, activation, and engagement through targeted onboarding experiences and feedback collection. The platform enables product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams to deploy contextual guidance and gather user insights directly within their applications.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of three primary components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** provide interactive, step-by-step user onboarding and feature discovery through five distinct templates: Tours (multi-step walkthroughs), Announcements (single-message communications), Checklists (task-oriented guidance), Banners (persistent notifications), and Tooltips (contextual help markers). These guides utilize behavioral triggers, strike detection, and rate-limiting mechanisms to ensure optimal user engagement without overwhelming the experience.

**Surveys** enable targeted feedback collection through four specialized block types: Rating blocks (supporting Stars, NPS, Emoji, and custom Rating labels), Long answer blocks for detailed responses, Short answer blocks for brief inputs, and List blocks for multiple choice selections. Surveys support conditional logic for dynamic response paths and can be deployed using modal, popover, and pin form factors.

**Resource Center** functions as an intelligent help widget that integrates external documentation repositories, provides semantic search capabilities, displays recommended content through Autopilot automation, and offers quick links with customizable call-to-action buttons. The Resource Center can scrape website content, manage recommendation sets, and provide personalized landing pages with various action types including visit link, click element, run callback, open third-party chat, show guide/survey, open article, and play video.

## Form Factors and Customization

The platform supports five primary form factors that determine how content appears to users: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual bubbles), Pin (persistent elements), Tooltip (marker-based hints), Banner (top/bottom notifications), and Checklist (task-oriented interfaces). Each form factor offers extensive customization options including position controls, z-index configuration, text animation effects (typewriter), advanced trigger element interactions, multi-step navigation, and interactive blocks supporting buttons, images, and videos.

The Themes system provides comprehensive branding control through a Theme Editor with Brand controls and Component editor sections, allowing customization of colors, typography (Google fonts integration), form controls, widget dimensions, animations, and platform-specific styling for web and mobile applications.

## SDK Implementation and Integration

Amplitude Guides and Surveys provides multi-platform SDK support:

**Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with the Amplitude Browser SDK using `amplitude.add(window.engagement.plugin())`, supports third-party analytics providers including Segment, offers Google Tag Manager template integration, and provides methods like `engagement.init()`, `engagement.boot()`, `engagement.gs.show()`, and `engagement.gs.reset()` for lifecycle management.

**iOS SDK** (`AmplitudeEngagement`) supports Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods installation, utilizes `AmplitudeBootOptions` for user/device ID configuration, implements screen tracking and element targeting through `accessibilityIdentifier`, and supports preview mode with custom URL schemes.

**Android SDK** (`amplitude-engagement-android`) requires Android API Level 24+ and Kotlin 1.8.22+, uses `AmplitudeEngagement` class initialization with `AmplitudeBootOptions`, provides screen tracking capabilities, and supports preview mode through AndroidManifest.xml intent filter configuration.

**React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) includes deep linking support via `handleURL()`, requires `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` dependency, and implements plugin booting with user/device ID initialization.

## Targeting and Experimentation

The platform provides sophisticated targeting capabilities through user segmentation (All Users vs Targeted Users with cohort filtering), rollout percentage controls with bucketing units, and comprehensive trigger mechanisms including element appearance/clicks, time delays, smart delay, rage click detection, user confusion signals, and event tracking integration.

Page targeting utilizes CSS Selector and XPath targeting with URL matching rules (contains, matches, regex), while priority levels (Urgent, High, Medium, Low) and display limits with cooldown periods ensure optimal user experience. The system supports active state management with tiebreaker logic for handling multiple eligible experiences.

**Amplitude Experiment Integration** enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys through variant configuration, experiment exposure event handling, and insights dashboard analytics with performance overview metrics and time-based analysis.

## Analytics and Measurement

The platform generates comprehensive analytics events tracked through Amplitude, including common properties like Lifecycle UUID, Step ID, and Variant ID for A/B testing. Generic events (Viewed/Dismissed/Completed) and specific events (Guide Engaged, Guide Step Completed, Survey Submitted, Survey Abandoned) provide detailed interaction tracking.

**Survey Analysis** features include the Insights tab for aggregate metrics and trends with NPS-specific breakdowns and Microscope integration for session replays, plus the Responses tab for individual user response data with CSV export functionality and filtering capabilities.

## Localization and Content Management

The localization system supports SDK initialization with locale parameters, Project settings for language management, and three translation methods: web interface editing, AI-powered translation using Claude, and XLIFF file workflow integration with trans-unit source/target tags.

**Content Management** includes tags for organizing guides and surveys with bulk operations support, draft/published status management with scheduling capabilities, and comprehensive permission systems with five access levels (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) that override base Amplitude user roles.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

The platform supports proxy configuration through AWS CloudFront as a reverse proxy using dual origins (cdn.amplitude.com for static assets, gs.amplitude.com for API requests with /sdk/ prefix) to circumvent domain blocking while maintaining low latency. Server zone configuration (US/EU) and Content Security Policy (CSP) nonce support ensure secure deployment across various environments.

Testing capabilities include preview mode for verifying trigger, limit, and throttle conditions before launch, with troubleshooting tools like Reset User History, Ignore Throttle Limits, and manual event triggering for comprehensive validation workflows.
