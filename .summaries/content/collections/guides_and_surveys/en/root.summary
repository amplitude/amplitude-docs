Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to enhance user onboarding, collect feedback, and improve retention, activation, and engagement metrics. The platform enables product, growth, and product marketing teams to create contextual, interactive experiences directly within their applications.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of three primary components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** are interactive, multi-step experiences designed for user onboarding and product education. They support five distinct form factors: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual bubbles), Pin (persistent markers), Tooltip (hover information), Banner (page-wide notifications), and Checklist (task-oriented workflows). Guides utilize behavioral triggers including element appearance/clicks, time delays, rage clicks, user confusion detection, and custom event tracking.

**Surveys** focus on feedback collection through four specialized block types: Rating blocks (supporting Stars, NPS, Emoji, and custom Rating labels), Long answer blocks for detailed responses, Short answer blocks for brief input, and List blocks for multiple choice options. Surveys support conditional logic for dynamic response branching and utilize a subset of guide form factors (modal, popover, pin).

**Resource Center** provides a searchable widget that integrates external documentation repositories and video content. It features an Autopilot system using semantic search algorithms to automatically surface relevant articles, along with customizable recommendation sets and quick links for immediate access to support resources.

## SDK Integration and Platform Support

The platform supports multi-platform deployment through dedicated SDKs:

- **Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with Amplitude Browser SDK, third-party analytics providers like Segment, and Google Tag Manager
- **iOS SDK** (`Amplitude-Engagement-Swift`) supports Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods installation with SwiftUI integration
- **Android SDK** (`amplitude-engagement-android`) provides Jetpack Compose support with `.amplitudeView` modifier
- **React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) enables cross-platform mobile deployment

All SDKs utilize the `AmplitudeEngagement` class for initialization and provide methods like `engagement.boot()`, `engagement.screen()` for tracking, and element targeting through accessibility identifiers or CSS selectors.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Form Factors** define the visual presentation and interaction patterns of guides, each with specific positioning and behavior characteristics. **Blocks** are the building components within guides and surveys that contain interactive elements like buttons, images, videos, and form inputs. **Triggers** are the conditions that determine when guides or surveys appear, ranging from simple time delays to complex behavioral patterns.

**Targeting** encompasses user segmentation through cohorts, page-specific URL matching patterns, and session properties. **Throttling** controls the frequency and rate at which guides and surveys appear to users through configurable limits across different time periods (day/week/month/session).

**Analytics Events** track user interactions through a comprehensive schema including Guide Viewed, Guide Completed, Guide Dismissed, Survey Submitted, Survey Abandoned, and Survey Completed events, each with associated properties like Lifecycle UUID, Step ID, and Variant ID.

## Advanced Features and Customization

The platform provides extensive customization through **Themes**, which control branding elements including colors, typography, form controls, and animations via a Theme Editor with Brand controls and Component editor sections. **Custom CSS** support (web SDK only, beta) allows granular styling control through amplitude-engagement CSS classes.

**Localization** enables multi-language content delivery through SDK locale configuration, with support for XLIFF file workflows, AI-powered translation via Claude, and fallback behavior configuration. **Personalization** is achieved through the "Personalize with Variables" feature, which dynamically inserts client-side user properties into content with configurable fallback values.

**Experimentation** integrates with Amplitude Experiment to support A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, with variant configuration, exposure event tracking, and performance analytics through the Insights dashboard.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

The platform utilizes several key endpoints and configurations:

- **Proxy Setup**: AWS CloudFront configuration with `cdn.amplitude.com` for static assets and `gs.amplitude.com` for API requests, including the critical `/sdk/*` path pattern
- **Preview Mode**: `/sdk/admin/config` endpoint for testing and validation
- **Deep Linking**: Custom URL scheme handling for mobile platforms with `handleURL()` functions
- **Event Forwarding**: `engagement.forwardEvent()` method for integrating with external analytics systems

## Organizational and Permission Structure

The platform implements a five-tier permission system (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) that overrides base Amplitude user roles to provide granular access control for viewing, editing, publishing, and experimenting with guides and surveys. **Tags** enable organizational structure for content management, with bulk operations and filtering capabilities.

**Templates** provide reusable starting points for guides and surveys, with visibility management and theme inheritance. The platform supports **Draft/Published/Scheduled** status management with active state behavior and tiebreaker rules for content prioritization.

## Analytics and Insights

The platform provides comprehensive analytics through the **Overview tab dashboard** with metrics including views/completions over time, rage closes percentage, and real-time interaction feeds. **Survey analysis** features include the Insights tab for aggregate metrics with NPS breakdowns and the Responses tab for individual user data with CSV export capabilities up to 10,000 responses.

Integration with **Microscope** enables session replay analysis, while time-based analysis supports hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly reporting periods. The analytics system tracks user engagement patterns and provides actionable insights for optimizing guide and survey performance.
