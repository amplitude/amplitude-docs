# Amplitude Guides and Surveys

## Product Overview

Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product messaging and feedback collection solution designed to improve user experience, facilitate product learning, gather user feedback, and enhance key metrics like retention, activation, and engagement. The product serves as an alternative to traditional popup components, providing more contextual and less disruptive ways to engage users within digital products.

The platform consists of two primary components:

1. **Guides**: In-product messages that help users complete tasks or explore features using behavioral triggers. Available in five form factors (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, and Banner) and five templates (Tour, Announcement, Checklist, Banner, and Tooltip).

2. **Surveys**: Targeted feedback collection tools with three template options (NPS, User Feedback, and Rating) designed to measure customer satisfaction, gather specific feedback, and evaluate initial reactions to product experiences.

The solution is particularly valuable for product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams looking to optimize user journeys and improve product metrics.

## Product Relationships and Features

### Core Components

1. **Guides System**:
   - **Templates**: Tour (step-by-step instructions), Announcement (important updates), Checklist (task completion), Banner (non-intrusive notifications), and Tooltip (contextual help)
   - **Form Factors**: Modal (centered overlay), Popover (positioned near elements), Pin (clickable markers), Tooltip (element annotations), and Banner (top/bottom notifications)
   - **Setup and Targeting**: Audience segmentation, behavioral triggers, priority settings, and display limits
   - **Multi-step Capabilities**: Sequential content presentation with navigation controls

2. **Surveys System**:
   - **Templates**: NPS (Net Promoter Score), User Feedback (custom questions), and Rating (quick reactions)
   - **Survey Blocks**: Rating blocks with various types (stars, emoji, NPS)
   - **Conditional Logic**: Dynamic survey paths based on user responses
   - **Response Analysis**: Aggregate data visualization and individual response tracking

3. **Analytics Integration**:
   - **Event Tracking**: Comprehensive event tracking for guide and survey interactions
   - **Performance Metrics**: Views, completions, and engagement patterns
   - **Microscope Integration**: Detailed user-level analysis

4. **Experimentation**:
   - **A/B Testing**: Test different guide/survey variants
   - **Multi-armed Bandit**: Optimization for maximum engagement
   - **Performance Analysis**: Comparative metrics across variants

5. **Customization**:
   - **Themes**: Control colors, typography, animations, and component styles
   - **Localization**: Multi-language support via .xliff files
   - **Proxy Configuration**: Domain blocking bypass options

### Integration Points

The Guides and Surveys functionality integrates with:
- Amplitude Analytics for event tracking and user segmentation
- Amplitude Experiment for A/B testing
- Third-party analytics providers via SDK configuration

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Guide**: An in-product message that helps users complete tasks or explore features.
2. **Survey**: A tool for collecting targeted user feedback.
3. **Form Factor**: The visual presentation style of a guide (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner).
4. **Template**: Pre-designed guide or survey structures for specific use cases.
5. **Trigger**: Conditions that determine when and where guides appear.
6. **Lifecycle UUID**: Unique identifier for tracking guide/survey instances.
7. **Variant ID**: Identifier for different versions in experiments.
8. **NPS (Net Promoter Score)**: Survey metric categorizing users as promoters, passives, or detractors.
9. **Conditional Logic**: Rules that create dynamic survey paths based on user responses.
10. **Rate-limiting**: Mechanisms to prevent overwhelming users with too many guides.
11. **Preview Mode**: Testing environment for verifying guide/survey behavior before launch.
12. **Throttle**: Controls how frequently guides can be shown to users.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Guides and Surveys is part of the broader Amplitude product ecosystem, which focuses on product analytics and digital optimization. The product:

1. **Leverages Amplitude Analytics**: Uses user behavior data and segments for targeting guides and surveys.
2. **Feeds Data Back to Analytics**: Sends guide and survey interaction events for comprehensive analysis.
3. **Integrates with Amplitude Experiment**: Enables A/B testing of different guide and survey variants.
4. **Complements Amplitude's Core Value Proposition**: Helps close the loop between analytics insights and user engagement actions.

The product follows Amplitude's permission model but allows for role overrides specific to Guides and Surveys, enabling teams to grant different access levels (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) specifically for this feature.

## Technical Implementation

### SDK Integration

```javascript
// Via Amplitude Browser SDK
import * as amplitude from '@amplitude/analytics-browser';
import * as engagement from '@amplitude/engagement-browser';

amplitude.init('API_KEY');
engagement.boot({
  client: amplitude,
  serverUrl: 'https://gs.amplitude.com',
  cdnUrl: 'https://cdn.amplitude.com'
});

// Via third-party analytics
import * as engagement from '@amplitude/engagement-browser';

engagement.boot({
  forwardEvent: (event) => {
    // Send to your analytics provider
    console.log(event);
  },
  serverUrl: 'https://gs.amplitude.com',
  cdnUrl: 'https://cdn.amplitude.com'
});
```

### Additional Configuration Options

```javascript
// Set theme mode
engagement.setThemeMode('dark');

// Add callback for guide/survey events
engagement.addCallback('guideViewed', (data) => {
  console.log('Guide viewed:', data);
});

// Configure for single-page applications
engagement.setRouter({
  onChange: (callback) => {
    // Listen for route changes and call callback
  }
});
```

### Localization Configuration

```javascript
engagement.boot({
  client: amplitude,
  locale: 'fr-FR',
  fallbackLocale: 'en-US'
});
```

### Proxy Configuration (CloudFront Example)

The documentation provides detailed instructions for setting up an AWS CloudFront distribution to reverse proxy both static assets and API traffic, helping to bypass domain blocking while minimizing latency.

## Analytics Events

The platform tracks numerous events including:
- Guide/Survey Viewed
- Guide/Survey Dismissed
- Guide/Survey Completed
- Survey Submitted
- Guide Engaged
- Step Changed
- Button Clicked

Each event includes properties such as:
- Lifecycle UUID
- Guide/Survey ID
- Template Type
- Form Factor
- Variant ID
- Step information (for multi-step guides)

These events can be analyzed through the Overview tab's analytics features, including filters, performance metrics, and interaction tracking for monitoring guide views, survey completions, and user engagement patterns.

Amplitude Guides and Surveys provides a comprehensive solution for in-product messaging and feedback collection, with robust customization, targeting, and analytics capabilities that integrate seamlessly with the broader Amplitude ecosystem.
