Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to improve user onboarding, engagement, and feedback collection. The platform enables product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams to create interactive guides and surveys that enhance retention, activation, and engagement metrics throughout the user journey.

## Core Product Components

The platform consists of three primary components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** provide interactive in-product guidance through five distinct form factors: Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner, and Checklist. These guides support multi-step navigation, advanced triggers, and various interactive blocks including buttons, images, and videos. Available templates include Tours for step-by-step instructions, Announcements for feature highlights, Checklists for task completion, Banners for persistent messaging, and Tooltips for contextual help.

**Surveys** enable targeted feedback collection using four unique block types: Rating (with Stars, NPS, Emoji, and Rating labels), Long answer, Short answer, and List blocks. Surveys support conditional logic for dynamic response paths and utilize a subset of guide form factors (modal, popover, pin). Key templates include NPS surveys, User feedback collection, and Rating surveys for measuring customer satisfaction.

**Resource Center** functions as a help widget that integrates with the Guides and Surveys SDK, providing search functionality, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. It features Autopilot functionality that uses semantic search algorithms to automatically generate content recommendations from external documentation repositories.

## Key Architecture and Integration

The platform operates through dedicated SDKs for multiple platforms including Web (@amplitude/engagement-browser), iOS (AmplitudeEngagement), Android (amplitude-engagement-android), and React Native (@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native). The core initialization pattern involves `engagement.init()` and `engagement.boot()` methods with configuration options for user identification, theme management, and event forwarding.

Integration capabilities extend to third-party analytics providers including Segment, Google Tag Manager, and native Amplitude Analytics. The system supports proxy configurations through AWS CloudFront with specific origins (cdn.amplitude.com for static assets, gs.amplitude.com for API requests) and critical `/sdk/*` path patterns for API routing.

## Targeting and Personalization Framework

The platform employs sophisticated targeting mechanisms including user segmentation (All Users vs Targeted Users), rollout percentages with bucketing units, and cohort filtering. Trigger mechanisms encompass element appearance/clicks, time delays, smart delay, rage click detection, user confusion patterns, and event-based tracking using CSS Selector and XPath targeting.

Page targeting utilizes URL matching patterns (contains, matches, regex) while priority levels (Urgent, High, Medium, Low) manage display precedence. The system implements display limits, cooldown periods, and active state management with tiebreaker logic for handling multiple eligible experiences.

## Analytics and Experimentation

Amplitude Experiment integration enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys through variant configuration and exposure event handling. The analytics framework tracks comprehensive event properties including Lifecycle UUID, Step ID, Variant ID for A/B testing, and specific events like Guide Engaged, Guide Step Completed, Survey Submitted, and Survey Abandoned.

Analysis capabilities include the Insights tab for aggregate metrics and trends with NPS-specific breakdowns, Microscope integration for session replays, and the Responses tab for individual user response data with CSV export functionality and filtering capabilities.

## Content Management and Localization

The platform supports comprehensive content management through templates that serve as reusable starting points, tags for organizational structure, and themes for brand customization. The Theme Editor provides Brand controls and Component editor sections for customizing colors, typography, form controls, cards, widget dimensions, and animations.

Localization functionality includes SDK locale initialization, Project settings for language management, and three translation methods: web interface editing, AI-powered translation using Claude, and XLIFF file workflow integration with translation fallback behavior.

## Permission System and Testing

A granular five-tier permission system (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) overrides base user roles to control access to viewing, editing drafts, publishing, and running experiments. The system provides project-level permission management through the Guides and Surveys > Permissions interface.

Testing capabilities include preview mode for verifying trigger, limit, and throttle conditions before launch, with troubleshooting tools like Reset User History, Ignore Throttle Limits, and manual event triggering. Live testing utilizes cohort targeting for real-world validation.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

Key technical endpoints include `/sdk/admin/config` for preview mode configuration and various SDK methods such as `engagement.gs.show()`, `engagement.gs.reset()`, `engagement.forwardEvent()`, `engagement.setRouter()` for SPA routing, and `engagement.updateLanguage()` for localization. Mobile implementations utilize platform-specific methods like `AmplitudeEngagement.boot()` for iOS and `getPlugin().handleURL()` for React Native deep linking.

The platform supports Content Security Policy (CSP) nonce configuration, serverZone selection (US/EU), and comprehensive callback registration through `engagement.addCallback()` for custom instrumentation and integration workflows.
