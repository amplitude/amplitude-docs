Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to improve user onboarding, engagement, and feedback collection. The platform enables product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams to create contextual guides and surveys that appear directly within applications to drive retention, activation, and engagement metrics.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of two primary components: **Guides** for user onboarding and feature education, and **Surveys** for collecting user feedback. Guides support five form factors (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner, and Checklist) with multi-step functionality and interactive elements including buttons, images, and videos. Surveys utilize four unique block types (Rating, Long answer, Short answer, List) with conditional logic for dynamic response paths, supporting specialized rating types including Stars, NPS, Emoji, and Rating labels.

The **Resource Center** widget integrates with the core SDK to provide a searchable help interface with recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. It features an Autopilot system that uses semantic search algorithms to automatically surface relevant articles from documentation repositories based on page context.

## Multi-Platform SDK Implementation

The platform supports web, iOS, Android, and React Native through dedicated SDKs. The **Web SDK** (@amplitude/engagement-browser) integrates with Amplitude Browser SDK, third-party analytics providers like Segment, and Google Tag Manager. The **iOS SDK** uses Swift Package Manager or CocoaPods installation with AmplitudeEngagement initialization, while the **Android SDK** supports Jetpack Compose through .amplitudeView modifiers and traditional views via contentDescription targeting. The **React Native SDK** (@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native) includes deep linking support via handleURL methods.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Lifecycle UUID** serves as the primary identifier for tracking user interactions across guide and survey sessions. **Step ID and Step Index** track progression through multi-step experiences, while **Variant ID** enables A/B testing functionality. **Strike detection** and **rate-limiting mechanisms** control guide frequency and user experience quality.

**Behavioral triggers** include immediate display, element-based activation, time delays, smart delay, rage click detection, user confusion detection, and event-based triggers. **Throttling** controls appearance frequency through configurable limits and time periods (day/week/month/session).

**Form factors** define presentation styles: Modals for focused interactions, Popovers for contextual guidance, Pins for persistent information, Tooltips for element-specific help, Banners for announcements, and Checklists for task completion tracking.

## Analytics and Experimentation Framework

The platform integrates deeply with Amplitude Analytics, tracking comprehensive event schemas including Guide Engaged, Guide Step Completed, Survey Submitted, Survey Abandoned, Tooltip Marker Viewed, and rage closed events. The **Insights tab** provides aggregate metrics and trends with NPS-specific breakdowns for promoters, passives, and detractors, while the **Responses tab** offers individual user response data with CSV export capabilities up to 10,000 responses.

**Amplitude Experiment integration** enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, with variant configuration, exposure event handling, and performance analytics through the insights dashboard. Experiments support treatment vs control groups with configurable rollout percentages.

## Targeting and Personalization

The platform offers sophisticated targeting through user segmentation, rollout percentages, bucketing units, and page-specific rules using URL matching patterns and CSS/XPath selectors. **Personalize with Variables** dynamically inserts client-side user properties into content with fallback value support.

**Localization** supports multi-language deployments through SDK locale configuration, AI-powered translation with Claude, and XLIFF file workflows. The system includes fallback behavior for missing translations and language toggle interfaces.

## Content Management and Organization

**Templates** provide reusable starting points for guides (Tours, Announcements, Checklists, Banners, Tooltips) and surveys (NPS, User feedback, Rating). The **Tags** feature enables organization and filtering with bulk operations support.

**Themes** allow comprehensive branding customization through the Theme Editor, including colors, typography, form controls, widget dimensions, and animations. Custom CSS styling provides additional control over form factor containers and survey elements through amplitude-engagement CSS classes.

## Permissions and Access Control

The platform implements a three-tier permission system (Viewer, Member, Manager) that overrides base Amplitude user roles, providing granular access control for viewing, editing drafts, publishing, and running experiments. Administrator roles have full access across all functionality.

## API Endpoints and Configuration

Key API patterns include `/sdk/*` path routing for proxy configurations, preview mode endpoints at `/sdk/admin/config`, and CDN asset delivery through cdn.amplitude.com. The platform supports AWS CloudFront reverse proxy setup with specific cache behaviors for static assets and API requests.

SDK initialization methods include `engagement.init()` and `engagement.boot()` for web, `AmplitudeEngagement.boot()` for mobile platforms, and programmatic control through methods like `engagement.gs.show()`, `engagement.gs.reset()`, and `engagement.forwardEvent()` for event-based triggers.

The platform integrates with broader Amplitude ecosystem through shared user identification, event forwarding, cohort targeting, and Microscope session replay integration, providing a unified approach to user experience optimization and analytics.
