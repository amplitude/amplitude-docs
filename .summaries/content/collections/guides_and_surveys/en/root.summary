Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user engagement platform that enables product teams to deliver contextual guidance, collect user feedback, and improve key metrics like retention, activation, and engagement. The platform serves as a sophisticated alternative to traditional popups, offering behavioral triggers, strike detection, and intelligent rate-limiting mechanisms.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of three primary components that work together to create seamless user experiences:

**Guides** provide non-intrusive in-product messaging through six template types: Tour (multi-step product exploration), Announcement (feature updates and communications), Checklists (task completion tracking), Carousel (swipe-able content sequences), Banners (persistent messaging), and Tooltips (contextual help). These guides support five distinct form factors: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual containers), Pin (element-anchored guidance), Tooltip (hover-based help), and Banner (persistent top/bottom messaging).

**Surveys** enable systematic user feedback collection through four specialized templates: NPS (Net Promoter Score measurement), User feedback (qualitative insights), Rating (satisfaction evaluation), and mobile Carousel (swipe-based onboarding). Surveys utilize four unique block types - Rating (Stars, NPS, Emoji, Rating labels), Long answer, Short answer, and List - with conditional logic supporting dynamic response branching.

**Resource Center** functions as an integrated help widget providing search functionality, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. It connects to external documentation repositories through website scraping, CSV/XML sitemap uploads, and manual content curation, with Autopilot's semantic search algorithm automatically surfacing relevant articles.

## Technical Implementation

The platform supports multi-platform deployment through dedicated SDKs:

**Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with Amplitude Browser SDK, third-party analytics providers like Segment, and Google Tag Manager. Key methods include `engagement.init()`, `engagement.boot()`, `engagement.forwardEvent()`, `engagement.setThemeMode()`, and `engagement.gs.show()`.

**iOS SDK** (`Amplitude-Engagement-Swift`) requires Swift 5.9 and iOS 15+, utilizing `AmplitudeEngagement` class with `accessibilityIdentifier` and `amplitudeView` modifier for element targeting, plus `amplitudeEngagement.screen()` for tracking.

**Android SDK** (`amplitude-engagement-android`) supports API Level 24+ with Kotlin 1.8.22, featuring `AmplitudeEngagement` class, `.amplitudeView` modifier for Jetpack Compose, and `contentDescription`/`tag` selectors for element targeting.

**React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) integrates with `@amplitude/analytics-react-native`, providing `getPlugin()`, `handleURL()` for deep linking, and plugin booting capabilities.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Lifecycle UUID**: Unique identifier tracking user journey progression through guides and surveys
**Variant ID**: A/B testing identifier for experiment management and multi-armed bandit optimization
**Step ID/Index**: Sequential tracking for multi-step guide navigation and completion analytics
**Form Factors**: Visual presentation modes (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner, Checklist) with specific positioning and interaction patterns
**Throttling**: Rate-limiting mechanism controlling artifact appearance frequency across day/week/month/session periods
**Targeting**: User segmentation system supporting cohorts, rollout percentages, bucketing units, and behavioral triggers
**Triggers**: Activation mechanisms including element appearance/clicks, time delays, smart delay, rage click, user confusion, and event tracking
**Resource Center**: Help widget ecosystem with search, recommendations, quick links, and CTA functionality

## Analytics and Measurement

The platform provides comprehensive analytics through Amplitude event tracking, capturing:

**Guide Events**: Guide Viewed, Guide Completed, Guide Engaged with properties like App Type (ios, android, react native, web), Source.type, triggerType, and Snooze Duration
**Survey Events**: Survey Submitted, Survey Abandoned with response properties and completion metrics
**Resource Center Events**: Resource Center Opened, Article Viewed, Search events with recommendation tracking

Analytics are accessible through the Insights tab (aggregate metrics, NPS breakdowns, time-based analysis) and Responses tab (individual user data with CSV export up to 10k responses), plus Microscope integration for session replay analysis.

## Advanced Features

**Experimentation**: Full Amplitude Experiment integration enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments with variant configuration, exposure event handling, and performance tracking through the insights dashboard.

**Localization**: Multi-language support through SDK locale configuration, XLIFF file workflows, AI localization with Claude, and fallback behavior management for Growth and Enterprise plans.

**Personalization**: Dynamic content insertion using client-side user properties with fallback values, plus session property targeting and content variables.

**Theming**: Comprehensive customization through Theme Editor with Brand controls and Component editor sections, supporting accent colors, Google fonts typography, form controls styling, widget dimensions, animations, and platform-specific themes.

**Custom CSS**: Beta web SDK feature providing CSS class selectors for targeting form factors and survey elements with `amplitude-engagement` CSS classes.

**Proxy Configuration**: AWS CloudFront reverse proxy setup with dual origins (cdn.amplitude.com for static assets, gs.amplitude.com for API requests) and specific cache behaviors including `/sdk/*` path patterns.

The platform integrates seamlessly into the broader Amplitude ecosystem, leveraging existing user segmentation, analytics infrastructure, and experiment management capabilities while providing specialized tools for in-product user engagement and feedback collection.
