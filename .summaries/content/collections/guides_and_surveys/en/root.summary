Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user engagement platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to enhance user onboarding, collect feedback, and improve retention, activation, and engagement metrics. The platform enables product, growth, and product marketing teams to create contextual, interactive experiences directly within their applications.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of three primary components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** are interactive, multi-step experiences designed for user onboarding, feature announcements, and task completion guidance. They support five distinct form factors: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual bubbles), Pin (persistent markers), Tooltip (hover-triggered help), Banner (page-wide notifications), and Checklist (task-oriented workflows). Guides utilize behavioral triggers including element appearance/clicks, time delays, rage click detection, user confusion patterns, and custom event tracking.

**Surveys** focus on feedback collection through four specialized block types: Rating (Stars, NPS, Emoji, Rating labels), Long answer, Short answer, and List (multiple choice). Surveys support conditional logic for dynamic response branching and utilize a subset of guide form factors (modal, popover, pin). The platform provides comprehensive analytics through an Insights tab for aggregate metrics and a Responses tab for individual user data with CSV export capabilities up to 10,000 responses.

**Resource Center** functions as a help widget that integrates with the Guides and Surveys SDK, providing search functionality, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. It features an Autopilot system that uses semantic search algorithms to automatically generate article recommendations by analyzing page content and surfacing relevant materials from configured content repositories.

## Multi-Platform SDK Implementation

The platform supports comprehensive cross-platform deployment through specialized SDKs:

**Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with Amplitude Browser SDK, third-party analytics providers like Segment, and Google Tag Manager. Key methods include `engagement.init()`, `engagement.boot()`, `engagement.forwardEvent()`, and `engagement.setThemeMode()` for theme management.

**iOS SDK** (`Amplitude-Engagement-Swift`) supports Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods installation, utilizing `AmplitudeEngagement` class with `amplitudeView` modifier for SwiftUI and `accessibilityIdentifier` for element targeting.

**Android SDK** (`amplitude-engagement-android`) provides Jetpack Compose support through `.amplitudeView` modifier and traditional Android views using `contentDescription` and `tag` selectors for element targeting.

**React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) offers deep linking support via `handleURL()` method and plugin-based architecture integration.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Lifecycle UUID** groups related events within a single user interaction session. **Step ID** and **Step Index** track progression through multi-step experiences. **Variant ID** enables A/B testing capabilities through Amplitude Experiment integration.

**Form Factors** define the visual presentation method: Modal (overlay), Popover (contextual), Pin (persistent marker), Tooltip (hover-triggered), Banner (page-wide), and Checklist (task-oriented).

**Targeting** encompasses user segmentation, page targeting with URL matching patterns, trigger conditions, and priority levels (urgent, high, medium, low). **Throttling** controls artifact appearance frequency through configurable limits across time periods (day/week/month/session).

**Templates** provide reusable starting points for guides and surveys, while **Themes** enable comprehensive branding customization including colors, typography, form controls, and animations.

## Analytics and Event Tracking

The platform generates comprehensive analytics events including Survey Submitted, Survey Abandoned, Guide Completed, Guide Dismissed, Tooltip Marker Viewed, and Rage Closed events. All events include common properties like Lifecycle UUID, Step ID, Variant ID for experimentation, and Survey Response data. Debug Mode filtering helps isolate testing activities from production analytics.

## Advanced Features and Integrations

**Experimentation** integrates with Amplitude Experiment to support A/B tests and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, with variant configuration and performance tracking through the insights dashboard.

**Localization** enables multi-language content delivery through SDK locale configuration, with support for XLIFF file translation workflows, AI localization using Claude, and fallback behavior configuration.

**Personalization** utilizes client-side user properties through the "Personalize with Variables" feature, allowing dynamic content insertion with fallback values when properties are unavailable.

**Custom CSS** styling provides extensive customization capabilities through CSS class selectors targeting form factors and survey elements, available as a beta feature for web SDK implementations.

## Permission System and Management

The platform implements a five-tier permission system (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) that overrides base Amplitude user roles, providing granular access control for viewing, editing drafts, publishing, and running experiments within the Guides and Surveys module.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

**Proxy Configuration** supports AWS CloudFront setup as a reverse proxy with specific origins (cdn.amplitude.com for static assets, gs.amplitude.com for API requests) and critical `/sdk/*` path patterns for API routing.

**Testing and Preview** capabilities include preview mode for condition verification, cohort targeting for live testing, and comprehensive troubleshooting tools with condition status indicators and user history management.

The platform integrates seamlessly with the broader Amplitude ecosystem, leveraging existing user segmentation, event tracking, and analytics infrastructure while providing specialized tools for in-product user engagement and feedback collection.
