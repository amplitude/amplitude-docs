Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to improve user retention, activation, and engagement through targeted onboarding experiences and feedback collection. The platform enables product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams to deploy contextual guidance and gather user insights directly within their applications.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of three primary components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** provide interactive in-product guidance through five distinct form factors: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual bubbles), Pin (persistent elements), Tooltip (hover information), Banner (notification bars), and Checklist (task lists). These guides support multi-step navigation, advanced triggers, and various interactive blocks including buttons, images, and videos. Available templates include Tours for step-by-step onboarding, Announcements for feature releases, Checklists for task completion, Banners for notifications, and Tooltips for contextual help.

**Surveys** enable targeted feedback collection through four specialized block types: Rating (Stars, NPS, Emoji, Rating labels), Long answer, Short answer, and List blocks. Surveys support conditional logic for dynamic response paths and utilize a subset of guide form factors (modal, popover, pin). Survey templates include NPS for customer satisfaction measurement, User feedback for general input collection, and Rating surveys for specific evaluations.

**Resource Center** functions as an intelligent help widget that integrates with the Guides and Surveys SDK, providing search functionality, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. It features Autopilot functionality that uses semantic search algorithms to automatically generate content recommendations from external documentation repositories.

## Platform Integration and SDKs

The platform supports multi-platform deployment through dedicated SDKs:

- **Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with Amplitude Browser SDK, third-party analytics providers like Segment, and Google Tag Manager
- **iOS SDK** (AmplitudeEngagement) supports Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods installation with iOS 15+ requirements
- **Android SDK** (amplitude-engagement-android) requires Android API Level 24+ and Kotlin 1.8.22
- **React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) includes deep linking support

All SDKs provide core methods including `init()`, `boot()`, `show()`, `reset()`, `list()`, and support for preview mode configuration with custom URL schemes.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Lifecycle UUID** - Unique identifier tracking user interaction sessions across guides and surveys
**Step ID/Step Index** - Sequential identifiers for multi-step experience navigation
**Variant ID** - A/B testing configuration identifier for experiment management
**Strike Detection** - Behavioral trigger mechanism that identifies user interaction patterns
**Rate-limiting** - Throttling mechanism controlling guide/survey display frequency
**Smart Delay** - Intelligent timing trigger that analyzes user behavior patterns
**Rage Click** - Detection mechanism for frustrated user interactions (rapid clicking)
**User Confusion Detection** - Behavioral analysis identifying users struggling with interface elements
**Recommendation Sets** - Curated content collections for Resource Center personalization
**Autopilot** - Automated content recommendation system using semantic search
**ThemeMode** - Visual appearance configuration (LIGHT/DARK/SYSTEM/auto)

## Targeting and Personalization System

The platform employs sophisticated targeting capabilities through multiple dimensions:

**User Targeting** supports All Users or Targeted Users with property/cohort filtering, enabling precise audience segmentation. **Trigger Conditions** include element appearance/clicks, time delays, smart delay, rage click detection, user confusion detection, and event tracking. **Page Targeting** utilizes URL matching patterns, CSS selectors, and XPath expressions for precise placement control.

**Priority Levels** (Urgent/High/Medium/Low) manage multiple experience conflicts through tiebreaker logic, while **Display Limits** and cooldown periods prevent user fatigue. The system supports **Draft/Published/Schedule** status management with active state behavior controls.

## Analytics and Experimentation

Amplitude Experiment integration enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys. The analytics system tracks comprehensive event properties including:

- Generic events: Viewed, Dismissed, Completed
- Guide-specific events: Guide Engaged, Guide Step Completed  
- Survey-specific events: Survey Submitted, Survey Abandoned
- Interaction events: Tooltip Marker Viewed, Rage Closed

The **Insights Dashboard** provides aggregate data analysis with type-specific insights including NPS scoring (promoters/detractors/passives), time-based engagement charts with Microscope integration for session replays, and individual user response analysis through the Responses tab.

## Localization and Theming

**Localization** support includes SDK locale initialization, Project settings language configuration, and translation workflows using both web interface and .xliff file methods. The system provides translation fallback behavior and supports multilingual content delivery.

**Themes** enable comprehensive branding customization through the Theme Editor with Brand controls and Component editor sections. Customization includes accent colors, Google Fonts typography, form controls styling, widget dimensions, CSS properties configuration, animation settings, and platform-specific themes for web and mobile.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

The platform supports **proxy configuration** through AWS CloudFront for domain blocking circumvention, utilizing dual origins (cdn.amplitude.com for static assets, gs.amplitude.com for API requests with /sdk/ prefix). **Server Zone** configuration supports both EU and US deployments with appropriate data residency compliance.

**Permission Management** implements a five-tier system (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) that overrides base Amplitude user roles, providing granular access control for viewing, editing drafts, publishing, and running experiments within the Guides and Surveys module.

The platform integrates seamlessly with the broader Amplitude ecosystem, leveraging existing user segmentation, cohort management, and analytics infrastructure while providing specialized in-product engagement capabilities that complement traditional analytics and experimentation workflows.
