Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to improve user onboarding, engagement, and feedback collection. The platform enables product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams to create contextual, interactive experiences that drive retention, activation, and engagement metrics through targeted guides and surveys deployed directly within applications.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The platform consists of several interconnected components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Core Experience Types:**
- **Guides**: Interactive step-by-step experiences including Tours, Announcements, Checklists, Banners, and Tooltips for user onboarding and feature discovery
- **Surveys**: Feedback collection tools with NPS, User feedback, and Rating templates supporting four block types (Rating, Long answer, Short answer, List) with conditional logic for dynamic response paths
- **Resource Center**: A searchable help widget that integrates external documentation repositories, provides AI-powered content recommendations through Autopilot, and offers quick links with customizable call-to-action buttons

**Form Factors and Presentation:**
The platform supports five primary form factors - Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner, and Checklist - each with extensive customization options including position controls, z-index configuration, text animation (typewriter effects), advanced triggers, and interactive elements like buttons, images, and videos. These form factors can be configured with multi-step functionality and various button actions including visit link, click element, show guide, and run callback functions.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Targeting and Triggers:**
- **Behavioral Triggers**: Element appearance, element clicks, time delays, smart delay, rage click, user confusion, and event tracking
- **Strike Detection**: System for identifying user interaction patterns
- **Rate-limiting**: Throttling mechanisms to control guide/survey frequency
- **Rollout Percentage**: Gradual deployment control with bucketing units
- **Priority Levels**: Urgent, High, Medium, Low classification for experience precedence

**Analytics and Tracking:**
- **Lifecycle UUID**: Unique identifier for tracking user journey progression
- **Step ID and Step Index**: Navigation tracking within multi-step experiences
- **Variant ID**: A/B testing experiment identification
- **Amplitude Analytics Events**: Comprehensive event schema including Viewed/Dismissed/Completed, Guide Engaged/Step Completed, Survey Submitted/Abandoned, Tooltip Marker Viewed, and Rage Closed events

**Content Management:**
- **Personalize with Variables**: Dynamic content insertion using client-side user properties with fallback values
- **Recommendation Sets**: Curated content collections for Resource Center with various action types
- **Autopilot**: AI-powered semantic search for automatic content recommendations
- **Templates**: Reusable starting points with automatic "Template" suffix naming convention

## SDK Integration and Technical Implementation

The platform provides comprehensive SDK support across multiple platforms:

**Web SDK (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`):**
- Integration with Amplitude Browser SDK as plugin
- Third-party analytics provider support (Segment)
- Google Tag Manager template availability
- Key methods: `engagement.init()`, `engagement.boot()`, `engagement.forwardEvent()`, `engagement.setThemeMode()`, `engagement.addCallback()`, `engagement.setRouter()`, `engagement.updateLanguage()`
- Content Security Policy (CSP) nonce support
- Proxy configuration with `serverUrl` and `cdnUrl` options

**Mobile SDKs:**
- **iOS**: Swift Package Manager/CocoaPods installation with `AmplitudeEngagement` class, `accessibilityIdentifier` targeting, Swift 5.9/iOS 15 requirements
- **Android**: Gradle dependencies with `AmplitudeEngagement` class, Android API Level 24 minimum, Kotlin 1.8.22 support
- **React Native**: `@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native` package with deep linking support via `handleURL()` method

**Preview and Testing:**
All SDKs support preview mode with custom URL scheme configuration for testing guides and surveys before deployment, including condition verification (trigger, limit, throttle) and manual event triggering.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

**Amplitude Analytics Integration:**
The platform deeply integrates with Amplitude's analytics ecosystem, automatically tracking user interactions and feeding data into Amplitude's behavioral analytics. The Insights tab provides aggregate metrics and trends with Microscope integration for session replay analysis.

**Experiment Platform Integration:**
Native integration with Amplitude Experiment enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, with variant configuration, exposure event handling, and performance analytics through the insights dashboard.

**Resource Center Ecosystem:**
The Resource Center connects to external documentation repositories through website scraping, supports third-party chat module integration, and provides semantic search capabilities across connected content sources.

## Permission System and Governance

The platform implements a three-tier permission system that overrides base Amplitude user roles:
- **Viewer**: Read-only access to published content
- **Member**: Draft editing capabilities
- **Manager**: Publishing permissions and experiment execution
- **Administrator**: Full access including user permission management

## Advanced Features and Customization

**Theming and Branding:**
Comprehensive Theme Editor with Brand controls and Component editor sections supporting accent color customization, Google Fonts typography, form controls styling, widget dimensions, CSS properties configuration, animation settings, and platform-specific themes.

**Localization Support:**
Multi-language content delivery through SDK locale configuration, AI-powered translation via Claude, XLIFF file upload workflow, and fallback behavior configuration for translation scenarios.

**Proxy Configuration:**
AWS CloudFront reverse proxy setup with dual origins (`cdn.amplitude.com` for static assets, `gs.amplitude.com` for API requests) and specific cache behaviors including the critical `/sdk/*` path pattern for API routing.

The platform represents a comprehensive solution for in-product user experience management, combining sophisticated targeting capabilities, multi-platform SDK support, and deep analytics integration to enable data-driven user engagement strategies.
