# Amplitude Guides and Surveys

Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product messaging and feedback collection platform designed to improve user experience, facilitate product adoption, and gather actionable user insights. The product serves as an alternative to traditional popup components, helping product teams, growth teams, and marketing teams to guide users through their product journey, collect targeted feedback, and improve key metrics like retention, activation, and engagement.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Guides
Guides are in-product messages that help users complete tasks or explore features. They use behavioral triggers and rate-limiting mechanisms to deliver contextual assistance without disrupting the user experience. Guides come in five form factors:

1. **Modal** - Full-screen overlays for important announcements
2. **Popover** - Targeted messages that point to specific UI elements
3. **Pin** - Small indicators that expand when clicked
4. **Tooltip** - Contextual help tied to specific UI elements
5. **Banner** - Persistent messages at the top or bottom of the screen

### Guide Templates
The platform offers five pre-built guide templates:

1. **Tour** - Step-by-step instructions for product exploration
2. **Announcement** - Single-step messages for important updates
3. **Checklist** - Multi-step guides for completing complex tasks
4. **Banner** - Persistent notifications
5. **Tooltip** - Contextual help for specific UI elements

### Surveys
Surveys enable targeted feedback collection from users. Three survey templates are available:

1. **NPS (Net Promoter Score)** - Measures customer satisfaction and loyalty
2. **User Feedback** - Customizable questions for gathering specific insights
3. **Rating** - Collects initial reactions to product experiences

### Survey Blocks
Surveys can include various question types:
- Rating blocks (Stars, Rating labels, Emoji, NPS)
- Conditional logic for creating dynamic response paths based on user input

## Product Relationships and Architecture

### SDK Integration
The Guides and Surveys SDK (`engagement-browser`) is the foundation for implementing the product. It can be integrated in three ways:
1. With Amplitude Browser SDK
2. With third-party analytics providers
3. Via Google Tag Manager

Key SDK methods include:
- `boot()` - Initializes the SDK
- `forwardEvent()` - Sends events to trigger guides
- `setThemeMode()` - Controls light/dark mode
- `addCallback()` - Adds custom event handlers
- `setRouter()` - Integrates with single-page applications
- `show()/reset()/closeAll()` - Programmatically controls guides

### Analytics Integration
Guides and Surveys deeply integrates with Amplitude Analytics, tracking user interactions through:
- Common event properties (Lifecycle UUID, Guide/Survey ID, etc.)
- Generic events (Viewed, Dismissed, Completed)
- Guide-specific events (Guide Step Viewed, Guide Step Completed)
- Survey-specific events (Survey Submitted, Survey Abandoned)

### Experimentation
The product integrates with Amplitude Experiment to enable:
- A/B testing of different guide/survey variants
- Multi-armed Bandit experiments for optimization
- Performance analysis through the Insights dashboard

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Guide-Related Terms
- **Form Factors**: The visual presentation styles of guides (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner)
- **Trigger Conditions**: Rules that determine when and where guides appear
- **Display Limits**: Controls how often guides can be shown to users
- **Smart Delay**: Automatic timing adjustment to avoid overwhelming users
- **Tiebreaker Rules**: Logic for determining which guide to show when multiple are eligible

### Survey-Related Terms
- **Rating Blocks**: Question types for collecting numerical or categorical feedback
- **Conditional Logic**: Rules that change survey flow based on previous answers
- **NPS**: Net Promoter Score, categorizing users as Promoters, Passives, or Detractors

### Analytics Terms
- **Lifecycle UUID**: Unique identifier for a guide or survey instance
- **Variant ID**: Identifier for experiment variants
- **Rage Close**: When a user dismisses a guide or survey quickly, indicating frustration

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Guides and Surveys fits into the broader Amplitude ecosystem through:

1. **Analytics Integration**: All guide and survey interactions are tracked in Amplitude Analytics, enabling comprehensive analysis of user engagement.

2. **Experimentation**: Integration with Amplitude Experiment allows for testing different guide and survey variants.

3. **User Profiles**: Guides and surveys can be targeted based on user properties and behaviors tracked in Amplitude.

4. **Microscope Integration**: Allows drilling down into individual user interactions with guides and surveys.

5. **Localization**: Enterprise customers can serve content in multiple languages based on user locale.

## Technical Implementation Details

### SDK Installation
```javascript
// With npm
npm install @amplitude/engagement-browser

// With script tag
<script src="https://cdn.amplitude.com/libs/engagement-browser.umd.min.js"></script>
```

### SDK Initialization
```javascript
// With Amplitude Browser SDK
amplitude.engagement.boot({
  client: amplitude,
  serverUrl: 'https://gs.amplitude.com',
  cdnUrl: 'https://cdn.amplitude.com'
});

// With third-party analytics
amplitude.engagement.boot({
  forwardEvent: function(event) {
    // Forward to your analytics provider
  },
  serverUrl: 'https://gs.amplitude.com',
  cdnUrl: 'https://cdn.amplitude.com'
});
```

### Proxy Configuration
For organizations facing domain blocking, a CloudFront distribution can be configured to proxy both static assets and API traffic:
- Origin 1: `cdn.amplitude.com` for static assets
- Origin 2: `gs.amplitude.com` for API traffic

### Permissions Management
Guides and Surveys has its own permission system with five access levels:
1. No Access
2. Viewer (can view published guides/surveys)
3. Member (can create and edit drafts)
4. Manager (can publish guides/surveys)
5. Administrator (full access including permissions management)

These permissions can override a user's base Amplitude role specifically for the Guides and Surveys feature.

## Analysis Capabilities

### Survey Analysis
The platform provides two main views for analyzing survey results:
1. **Insights Tab**: Shows aggregate data including:
   - NPS breakdown (Promoters/Passives/Detractors)
   - Time-based analysis
   - Filtering options
2. **Responses Tab**: Displays individual user feedback with sorting and filtering capabilities

### Guide Performance
The Overview tab provides analytics on guide performance:
- Views and completions charts
- Filter cards for segmentation
- Real-time interaction feed
- Rage closes measurement

Through these capabilities, Amplitude Guides and Surveys offers a comprehensive solution for improving user experience, collecting feedback, and driving product adoption through contextual, in-product messaging.
