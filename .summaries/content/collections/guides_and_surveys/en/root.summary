# Amplitude Guides and Surveys

## Product Overview

Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product messaging and feedback collection solution designed to improve user experience, facilitate product learning, gather user feedback, and enhance key metrics like retention, activation, and engagement. The product serves as an alternative to traditional popup components, providing more contextual and less disruptive ways to engage users within digital products.

The platform consists of two primary components:

1. **Guides**: In-product messages that help users complete tasks or explore features through various templates including Tours, Announcements, Checklists, Banners, and Tooltips.

2. **Surveys**: Targeted feedback collection tools with templates for NPS (Net Promoter Score), User Feedback, and Rating surveys.

The solution is designed for cross-functional use by product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams to optimize the user journey and improve product metrics.

### Proxy Configuration

For environments where domain blocking is a concern, the documentation provides detailed instructions for setting up an AWS CloudFront distribution to reverse proxy both static assets and API traffic.

The platform tracks numerous events automatically, including:

- **Common Events**: Guide/Survey Viewed, Dismissed, Completed
- **Guide-specific Events**: Guide Engaged, Guide Step Viewed
- **Survey-specific Events**: Survey Submitted, Survey Question Answered

Each event includes properties such as Lifecycle UUID, Guide/Survey ID, Template Type, and Variant ID for comprehensive analytics.
