Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to improve user onboarding, engagement, and feedback collection. The platform enables product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams to create interactive guides and surveys that integrate seamlessly into web and mobile applications to drive retention, activation, and engagement metrics.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The platform consists of several interconnected components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Core Components:**
- **Guides**: Interactive in-product experiences including Tours, Announcements, Checklists, Banners, and Tooltips that guide users through product features and onboarding flows
- **Surveys**: Feedback collection tools with specialized templates for NPS, user feedback, and rating collection using four block types (Rating, Long answer, Short answer, List)
- **Resource Center**: A searchable help widget that surfaces relevant documentation and content through semantic search and recommendation sets
- **Analytics Integration**: Deep integration with Amplitude's analytics platform for tracking user interactions and measuring performance

**Supporting Infrastructure:**
- **Multi-platform SDKs**: Native support for web (@amplitude/engagement-browser), iOS (AmplitudeEngagement), Android (amplitude-engagement-android), and React Native (@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native)
- **Experimentation Framework**: Integration with Amplitude Experiment for A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys
- **Localization System**: Multi-language support through SDK locale configuration, AI-powered translation, and XLIFF file workflows
- **Theme System**: Comprehensive branding customization including colors, typography, form controls, and animations

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Form Factors**: The visual presentation styles for guides and surveys:
- **Modal**: Full-screen overlay experiences
- **Popover**: Contextual floating elements
- **Pin**: Persistent positioned elements
- **Tooltip**: Marker-based contextual hints
- **Banner**: Sticky notification bars
- **Checklist**: Task-oriented interactive lists

**Targeting and Triggers**:
- **Behavioral Triggers**: Element appearance, element clicks, time delays, smart delay, rage click, and user confusion detection
- **Strike Detection**: System for identifying user interaction patterns
- **Rate-limiting**: Mechanisms to control guide frequency and prevent user fatigue
- **Rollout Percentage**: Gradual deployment control with bucketing units

**Analytics Properties**:
- **Lifecycle UUID**: Unique identifier for tracking user journey progression
- **Step ID/Step Index**: Navigation tracking within multi-step experiences
- **Variant ID**: A/B testing variant identification
- **Rage Closed**: Event tracking when users forcefully dismiss experiences

**Content Management**:
- **Recommendation Sets**: Curated content collections for Resource Center
- **Autopilot**: Automated content recommendation using semantic search
- **Templates**: Reusable starting points for guides and surveys with automatic "Template" suffix naming
- **Tags**: Organizational system for content categorization and filtering

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Guides and Surveys integrates deeply with the broader Amplitude ecosystem and external platforms:

**Amplitude Platform Integration**:
- Native analytics event tracking with automatic instrumentation
- Microscope integration for session replay analysis
- Cohort targeting and segmentation capabilities
- Experiment framework integration for variant testing

**Third-party Integrations**:
- Segment analytics forwarding via `forwardEvent()` method
- Google Tag Manager template support
- AWS CloudFront proxy configuration for enterprise deployments
- Third-party chat module integration within Resource Center

**Development Ecosystem**:
- Content Security Policy (CSP) support with nonce configuration
- Single Page Application (SPA) routing integration via `engagement.setRouter()`
- Custom callback registration through `engagement.addCallback()`
- Preview mode with deep linking for development testing

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Core SDK Methods**:
- `engagement.init()` and `engagement.boot()`: Initialization and user context setup
- `engagement.gs.show()` and `engagement.gs.reset()`: Guide/survey display control
- `engagement.forwardEvent()`: Event tracking for behavioral triggers
- `engagement.updateLanguage()`: Runtime localization switching
- `engagement._setUserProperties()`: Dynamic user property updates

**Mobile SDK Implementations**:
- iOS: `AmplitudeEngagement` class with `accessibilityIdentifier` targeting
- Android: `AmplitudeEngagement` with API Level 24+ support and Kotlin 1.8.22
- React Native: Plugin-based architecture with `getPlugin()` and `handleURL()` methods

**Configuration Options**:
- Server zone selection (US/EU) via `serverZone` parameter
- Theme management through `ThemeMode` (LIGHT/DARK/SYSTEM/auto)
- Proxy setup with `serverUrl` and `cdnUrl` for enterprise deployments
- Preview mode configuration with custom URL schemes and `handlePreviewLinkIntent`

**Resource Center API Patterns**:
- `/sdk/*` path pattern for API routing through proxy configurations
- Website scraper with URL extraction and content selector overrides
- Sync error handling with Force Sync and Publish capabilities

The platform operates on a permission-based system with five access levels (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) that override base Amplitude user roles, providing granular control over guide/survey creation, editing, publishing, and experiment execution capabilities.
