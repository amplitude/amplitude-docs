# Amplitude Guides and Surveys

Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product messaging and feedback collection platform designed to improve user experience, facilitate product adoption, and gather actionable user insights. The product serves as an alternative to traditional popup components, helping product teams, growth teams, and marketing teams to guide users through their product journey, collect targeted feedback, and improve key metrics like retention, activation, and engagement.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Guides
Guides are in-product messages that help users complete tasks or explore features. They use behavioral triggers and rate-limiting mechanisms to deliver contextual assistance without disrupting the user experience. Guides come in five form factors:

1. **Modal** - Full-screen overlays for important announcements
2. **Popover** - Targeted messages that point to specific UI elements
3. **Pin** - Small indicators that expand when clicked
4. **Tooltip** - Contextual help tied to specific UI elements
5. **Banner** - Persistent messages at the top or bottom of the screen

### Guide Templates
The platform offers five pre-built guide templates:

1. **Tour** - Step-by-step instructions for product exploration
2. **Announcement** - Single-step messages for important updates
3. **Checklist** - Task-oriented guides for feature adoption
4. **Banner** - Persistent notifications
5. **Tooltip** - Contextual help for specific UI elements

### Surveys
Surveys enable targeted feedback collection with three template options:

1. **NPS (Net Promoter Score)** - Measures customer satisfaction and loyalty
2. **User Feedback** - Customizable questions for specific insights
3. **Rating** - Gathers initial reactions to product experiences

### Survey Blocks
Surveys can include various question types:
- Rating blocks (Stars, Rating labels, Emoji, NPS)
- Conditional logic for creating dynamic response paths based on user input

## Product Relationships and Architecture

### SDK Integration
The Guides and Surveys functionality is delivered through the Guides and Surveys SDK, which can be integrated in three ways:
1. Via Amplitude Browser SDK
2. Through third-party analytics providers
3. Using Google Tag Manager

Key SDK methods include:
- `boot()` - Initializes the SDK
- `forwardEvent()` - Sends events to the SDK
- `setThemeMode()` - Controls light/dark mode
- `addCallback()` - Registers callback functions
- `reset()/show()/list()` - Controls guide behavior

### Analytics Integration
Guides and Surveys deeply integrates with Amplitude's analytics platform:
- Events and properties are automatically tracked
- The Overview tab provides analytics on guide performance
- Microscope integration enables detailed user journey analysis
- Survey results can be analyzed in aggregate or at the individual response level

### Experimentation
Integration with Amplitude Experiment allows for:
- A/B testing of guides and surveys
- Multi-armed Bandit experiments
- Variant configuration and management
- Performance analysis through the Insights dashboard

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Analytics Events
- **Viewed** - When a guide or survey is shown to a user
- **Dismissed** - When a user actively closes a guide or survey
- **Completed** - When a user finishes all steps of a guide
- **Survey Submitted** - When a user completes and submits a survey
- **Survey Abandoned** - When a user starts but doesn't complete a survey

### Properties
- **Lifecycle UUID** - Unique identifier for a guide or survey instance
- **Variant ID** - Identifies experiment variants
- **Tooltip Marker** - Element that triggers a tooltip

### Targeting and Triggers
- **Audience targeting** - Who sees the guide or survey
- **Trigger conditions** - When and where guides appear
- **Priority settings** - How guides are prioritized when multiple are eligible
- **Display limits** - Controls how often guides can be shown
- **Guide status** - Draft, published, or scheduled state

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Guides and Surveys fits into the broader Amplitude ecosystem by:

1. **Analytics Integration** - All guide and survey interactions generate analytics events that can be analyzed in Amplitude
2. **Experimentation** - Direct integration with Amplitude Experiment for A/B testing
3. **User Cohorts** - Leverages Amplitude's user segmentation for targeting
4. **Microscope** - Connects individual user journeys with guide and survey interactions

## Advanced Features

### Localization
Guides and Surveys supports content in multiple languages without creating duplicates. Implementation requires:
- SDK updates to specify user locale
- Project settings configuration for supported languages
- Fallback behaviors for missing translations

### Theming
The platform allows extensive customization of appearance through themes:
- Brand colors and typography
- Component styles and dimensions
- Animation settings
- Light/dark mode support

### Permissions System
Guides and Surveys has its own permission system that can override a user's base Amplitude role:
- No access
- Viewer (can view but not edit)
- Member (can edit drafts but not publish)
- Manager (can publish and edit)
- Administrator (full access)

### Proxy Configuration
For organizations facing domain blocking issues, the platform supports reverse proxy configuration using AWS CloudFront to proxy both static assets and API traffic.

## API and Command Line References

The primary interface for developers is the SDK with these key methods:

```javascript
// Initialize the SDK
amplitude.guides.boot({
  serverUrl: 'https://gs.amplitude.com',
  cdnUrl: 'https://cdn.amplitude.com',
  clientKey: 'YOUR_CLIENT_KEY'
});

// Forward events to the SDK
amplitude.guides.forwardEvent('event_name', {property1: 'value1'});

// Set theme mode
amplitude.guides.setThemeMode('dark');

// Add callbacks
amplitude.guides.addCallback('before_guide_displayed', function(guide) {
  // Custom logic
  return guide;
});

// Reset user history
amplitude.guides.reset();

// Show a specific guide
amplitude.guides.show('guide_id');

// List available guides
amplitude.guides.list();
```
