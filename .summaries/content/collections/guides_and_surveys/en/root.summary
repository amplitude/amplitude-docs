# Amplitude Guides and Surveys

## Product Overview

Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product messaging and feedback collection platform designed to improve user experience, facilitate product learning, gather user feedback, and enhance key metrics like retention, activation, and engagement. The product serves as an alternative to traditional popup components, providing more contextual and less disruptive user interactions.

The platform consists of two primary components:

1. **Guides**: In-product messages that help users complete tasks or explore features through behavioral triggers. Available in five form factors (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, and Banner) and five templates (Tour, Announcement, Checklist, Banner, and Tooltip).

2. **Surveys**: Targeted feedback collection tools with templates including NPS (Net Promoter Score), User Feedback, and Rating surveys to measure customer satisfaction and gather product experience feedback.

The product is designed for cross-functional use by product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams, enabling them to create, target, analyze, and optimize in-app communications.

## API Endpoints and Implementation

### SDK Implementation

```javascript
// Installation
npm install @amplitude/engagement-browser

// Basic initialization
import { boot } from '@amplitude/engagement-browser';

boot({
  client: {
    apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
    configuration: {
      serverUrl: 'https://api.amplitude.com',
      serverZone: 'US'
    }
  }
});

// With third-party analytics
import { boot, forwardEvent } from '@amplitude/engagement-browser';

boot({
  client: {
    apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
    configuration: {
      serverUrl: 'https://api.amplitude.com',
      serverZone: 'US'
    }
  }
});

// Forward events from third-party analytics
analytics.on('track', event => {
  forwardEvent({
    event_type: event.event,
    event_properties: event.properties
  });
});

// Set theme mode
import { setThemeMode } from '@amplitude/engagement-browser';
setThemeMode('dark');

// Add callbacks
import { addCallback } from '@amplitude/engagement-browser';
addCallback('guideViewed', (guide) => {
  console.log('Guide viewed:', guide);
});
```

### Localization Configuration

```javascript
// SDK initialization with locale
boot({
  client: {
    apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
    configuration: {
      serverUrl: 'https://api.amplitude.com',
      serverZone: 'US'

  },
  locale: 'fr-FR' // Set user's locale
});
```

### Preview Mode Testing

Preview mode can be accessed through the UI or via URL parameters:
```
https://your-site.com/?gsPreview=true&gsPreviewId=YOUR_GUIDE_ID
```

### CloudFront Proxy Configuration

For environments where direct access to Amplitude domains is blocked, a CloudFront distribution can be configured with:

- Origin 1: cdn.amplitude.com (for static assets)
- Origin 2: gs.amplitude.com (for API traffic)

SDK initialization with proxy:
```javascript
boot({
  client: {
    apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
    configuration: {
      serverUrl: 'https://your-cloudfront-distribution.com',
      cdnUrl: 'https://your-cloudfront-distribution.com'
    }
  }
});
```
