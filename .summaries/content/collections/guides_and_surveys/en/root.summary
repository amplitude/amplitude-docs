## API and Implementation Details

### SDK Implementation

The Guides and Surveys SDK can be installed in several ways:

```javascript
// With Amplitude Browser SDK
import * as amplitude from '@amplitude/analytics-browser';
import * as engagement from '@amplitude/engagement-browser';

amplitude.init('API_KEY');
engagement.boot({
  client: amplitude,
  serverUrl: 'https://gs.amplitude.com',
  cdnUrl: 'https://cdn.amplitude.com'
});

// With third-party analytics
import * as engagement from '@amplitude/engagement-browser';

engagement.boot({
  apiKey: 'API_KEY',
  forwardEvent: (event) => {
    // Send to third-party analytics
  },
  serverUrl: 'https://gs.amplitude.com',
  cdnUrl: 'https://cdn.amplitude.com'
});
```

### SDK Methods

- `engagement.boot()`: Initialize the SDK
- `engagement.reset()`: Reset user state
- `engagement.show()`: Manually display a guide/survey
- `engagement.list()`: List available guides/surveys
- `engagement.setThemeMode()`: Set light/dark theme mode

### Proxy Configuration

For environments with domain restrictions, a CloudFront distribution can be configured:

```javascript
// SDK configuration with custom domains
engagement.boot({
  client: amplitude,
  serverUrl: 'https://your-domain.com/gs-proxy',
  cdnUrl: 'https://your-domain.com/cdn-proxy'
});
```

### Localization Implementation

```javascript
// Set locale during SDK initialization
engagement.boot({
  client: amplitude,
  locale: 'fr-FR', // French locale
  serverUrl: 'https://gs.amplitude.com',
  cdnUrl: 'https://cdn.amplitude.com'
});
```

The platform uses these implementation details to deliver targeted guides and surveys to users, collect feedback, and provide analytics on user engagement, helping product teams improve user experience and achieve business objectives.
