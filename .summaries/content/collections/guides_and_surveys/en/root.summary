Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to improve user onboarding, engagement, and feedback collection. The platform targets product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams seeking to enhance retention, activation, and engagement metrics through contextual user guidance and data collection.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of two primary components: **Guides** for interactive user onboarding and **Surveys** for feedback collection. Guides offer five distinct form factors (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner, and Checklist) with multi-step functionality and interactive blocks including buttons, images, and videos. Surveys support four unique block types (Rating, Long answer, Short answer, List) with conditional logic for dynamic response paths, utilizing a subset of guide form factors (modal, popover, pin).

The **Resource Center** serves as an intelligent help widget that integrates with the Guides and Surveys SDK, providing search functionality, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. It features **Autopilot**, which automatically generates content recommendation sets using semantic search to surface relevant articles from repositories based on page context.

## Multi-Platform SDK Implementation

The platform provides comprehensive SDK support across web, iOS, Android, and React Native platforms:

- **Web SDK**: `@amplitude/engagement-browser` package with methods like `engagement.init()`, `engagement.boot()`, `engagement.gs.show()`, and `engagement.gs.reset()`
- **iOS SDK**: AmplitudeEngagement class with Swift Package Manager/CocoaPods installation, supporting `accessibilityIdentifier` for element targeting
- **Android SDK**: `amplitude-engagement-android` with AmplitudeEngagement class, requiring Android API Level 24 and Kotlin 1.8.22
- **React Native SDK**: `@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native` with deep linking support via `handleURL()` method

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Lifecycle UUID** and **Step ID** serve as primary identifiers for tracking user interactions. **Variant ID** enables A/B testing capabilities through Amplitude Experiment integration. **Strike detection** and **rate-limiting mechanisms** control guide frequency and user experience quality. **Rage closes** track user frustration when guides are dismissed aggressively.

**Form factors** define presentation styles: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual bubbles), Pin (persistent elements), Tooltip (hover information), Banner (top/bottom notifications), and Checklist (task-oriented interfaces). **Triggers** include element appearance/clicks, time delays, smart delay, rage click, user confusion, and event tracking.

## Analytics and Experimentation Framework

The platform integrates deeply with Amplitude's analytics ecosystem, tracking events like Guide Engaged, Guide Step Completed, Survey Submitted, and Survey Abandoned. **Microscope integration** provides session replay capabilities for behavioral analysis. The **Insights tab** offers aggregate metrics and trends with NPS-specific breakdowns, while the **Responses tab** provides individual user response data with export functionality.

**Amplitude Experiment integration** enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, with variant configuration, exposure event handling, and performance analytics through the insights dashboard.

## Targeting and Personalization

The platform offers sophisticated targeting capabilities including user segmentation (All Users vs Targeted Users), rollout percentages with bucketing units, cohort filtering, and page targeting rules using URL matches, contains, or regex patterns. **Priority levels** (Urgent, High, Medium, Low) with tiebreaker logic manage multiple eligible experiences.

**CSS Selector and XPath targeting** enable precise element-based triggers, while **display limits and cooldown periods** prevent user fatigue. The system supports **query parameter link sharing** for testing and **preview mode** for development validation.

## Content Management and Localization

The platform includes a comprehensive **tags feature** for organizing guides and surveys with bulk operations and filtering capabilities. **Templates** provide reusable starting points with automatic "Template" suffix naming conventions and visibility management through blue banner indicators.

**Localization functionality** supports SDK initialization with locale parameters, Project settings for language management, and three translation methods: web interface editing, AI-powered translation using Claude, and XLIFF file workflow integration with `trans-unit source target tags`.

## Themes and Customization

The **Theme Editor** enables comprehensive branding customization including accent colors, Google fonts typography, form controls styling, widget dimensions, CSS properties configuration, and animation settings. Themes support platform-specific configurations for web and mobile with brand identity enforcement across in-product messaging.

## Permission System and Governance

A five-tier permission system (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) overrides base Amplitude user roles, providing granular access control for viewing, editing drafts, publishing, and running experiments. The system includes **draft vs published** state management with scheduling capabilities.

## Technical Integration Points

Key API endpoints include `/sdk/*` path patterns for API routing, with proxy configuration support through AWS CloudFront. The platform supports **Content Security Policy (CSP)** nonce configuration, **serverZone** (US/EU) selection, and third-party analytics integrations including Segment and Google Tag Manager.

**Resource Center** content sourcing includes website scraping with URL extraction methods, CSV/XML sitemap upload, content selector overrides, and sync error management through Force Sync and Publish operations.
