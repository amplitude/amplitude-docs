Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to enhance user onboarding, collect feedback, and improve retention, activation, and engagement metrics. The platform enables product, growth, and product marketing teams to create contextual, interactive experiences directly within their applications.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of three primary components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** are interactive, multi-step experiences designed for user onboarding and product exploration. They support five form factors (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner, and Checklist) and include templates for Tours, Announcements, Checklists, Banners, and Tooltips. Guides can incorporate various interactive blocks including buttons, images, videos (YouTube, Vimeo, Loom, Vidyard, MP4), and support advanced features like conditional logic and multi-step configurations.

**Surveys** focus on feedback collection through four unique block types: Rating (with Stars, NPS, Emoji, and Rating labels), Long answer, Short answer, and List blocks. Surveys support conditional logic for dynamic response branching and utilize a subset of guide form factors (modal, popover, pin). The platform provides comprehensive analytics through Insights tabs for aggregate metrics and Responses tabs for individual user data analysis.

**Resource Center** functions as a help widget that integrates with the Guides and Surveys SDK, providing search functionality, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. It features an Autopilot system that uses semantic search algorithms to automatically generate article recommendations from content repositories.

## SDK Implementation and Platform Support

The platform supports multi-platform deployment through dedicated SDKs:

- **Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with Amplitude Browser SDK, third-party analytics providers like Segment, and Google Tag Manager
- **iOS SDK** (`Amplitude-Engagement-Swift`) supports Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods installation with iOS 15+ requirements
- **Android SDK** (`amplitude-engagement-android`) supports Jetpack Compose with `.amplitudeView` modifier and traditional Android views
- **React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) integrates with `@amplitude/analytics-react-native`

All SDKs support element targeting through various selectors (CSS selectors, XPath, accessibilityIdentifier, contentDescription), screen tracking, theme management, and preview mode configuration with custom URL schemes.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Form Factors** define the visual presentation and positioning of guides and surveys, including Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual containers), Pin (element-anchored displays), Tooltip (hover information), Banner (persistent notifications), and Checklist (task-oriented interfaces).

**Targeting and Triggers** control when and to whom content appears, supporting element appearance/clicks, time delays, rage clicks, user confusion detection, event tracking, user segmentation, page targeting with URL matching patterns, and session properties.

**Lifecycle Management** encompasses status states (draft, published, scheduled), priority levels (urgent, high, medium, low), display limits and cooldown periods, throttling configuration, and active state behavior with tiebreaker rules.

**Analytics Events** are tracked through Amplitude with specific event types including Guide Viewed, Guide Completed, Guide Engaged, Survey Submitted, Survey Abandoned, and Resource Center interactions, all containing properties like Lifecycle UUID, Step ID, Variant ID, and App Type.

## Advanced Features and Customization

**Experimentation** integrates with Amplitude Experiment to support A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, including variant configuration, exposure event handling, and performance analytics through the insights dashboard.

**Personalization** supports dynamic content through the "Personalize with Variables" feature, allowing insertion of client-side user properties into text blocks with fallback value configuration.

**Localization** enables multi-language content delivery through SDK locale configuration, project language settings, fallback behavior, and content translation via web interface, AI localization with Claude, or XLIFF file upload.

**Theming** provides comprehensive branding customization through the Theme Editor, including Brand controls and Component editor sections for colors, typography, form controls, widget dimensions, animations, and platform-specific themes.

**Custom CSS** (beta feature, web SDK only) allows advanced styling through CSS class selectors targeting form factor containers and survey elements with `amplitude-engagement` CSS classes.

## API Endpoints and Integration Points

Key SDK methods include:
- `engagement.init()` and `engagement.boot()` for initialization
- `engagement.forwardEvent()` for event-based triggers
- `engagement.gs.show()` and `engagement.gs.reset()` for programmatic control
- `engagement.setThemeMode()` for theme management
- `engagement.updateLanguage()` for localization
- `engagement.setSessionProperty()` for targeting
- `handleURL()` for deep linking (mobile SDKs)

The platform supports proxy configuration through AWS CloudFront with specific origins (`cdn.amplitude.com` for static assets, `gs.amplitude.com` for API requests) and critical `/sdk/*` path patterns for API routing.

## Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Guides and Surveys integrates deeply with the broader Amplitude ecosystem, leveraging Amplitude Analytics for event tracking, Amplitude Experiment for A/B testing, and Microscope for session replay analysis. The platform supports role-based permissions with five access levels (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) that override base Amplitude user roles.

The Resource Center component extends functionality by connecting to external documentation repositories through website scraping, supporting various content sources, and providing intelligent content recommendations through semantic search algorithms. This creates a unified help ecosystem that combines in-product guidance with external documentation and support resources.
