Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to enhance user onboarding, collect feedback, and improve retention, activation, and engagement metrics. The platform enables product, growth, and product marketing teams to create contextual, interactive experiences directly within their applications.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of three primary components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** are interactive, multi-step experiences designed for user onboarding and product exploration. They support five form factors (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner, and Checklist) and offer templates including Tours, Announcements, Checklists, Banners, and Tooltips. Guides can incorporate interactive blocks such as buttons, images, and videos, with advanced features like conditional logic and multi-step navigation.

**Surveys** focus on feedback collection through four unique block types: Rating (with Stars, NPS, Emoji, and Rating labels), Long answer, Short answer, and List blocks. Surveys support conditional logic for dynamic response branching and utilize a subset of guide form factors (modal, popover, pin). The platform provides comprehensive analytics through Insights tabs for aggregate metrics and Responses tabs for individual user data analysis.

**Resource Center** functions as a help widget that integrates with the Guides and Surveys SDK, providing search functionality, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. It features an Autopilot system that uses semantic search to automatically generate article recommendations by analyzing page content and surfacing relevant articles from content repositories.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

The platform employs specific terminology for tracking and configuration:

- **Lifecycle UUID**: Unique identifier for tracking user interactions across guide/survey sessions
- **Step ID/Step Index**: Identifiers for individual steps within multi-step experiences
- **Variant ID**: Used for A/B testing and experimentation within guides and surveys
- **Form Factors**: The visual presentation modes (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner, Checklist)
- **Throttling**: Rate limiting controls that manage how frequently guides and surveys appear to users
- **Strike Detection**: Mechanism for tracking user interaction patterns and engagement
- **Recommendation Sets**: Customizable collections of articles and information for Resource Center

## SDK Implementation and Technical Integration

The platform supports multi-platform deployment through dedicated SDKs:

**Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with the Amplitude Browser SDK and supports third-party analytics providers like Segment and Google Tag Manager. Key methods include `engagement.init()`, `engagement.boot()`, `engagement.forwardEvent()`, and `engagement.gs.show()`.

**iOS SDK** utilizes Swift Package Manager or CocoaPods installation with `AmplitudeEngagement` class initialization, supporting element targeting through `accessibilityIdentifier` and `.amplitudeView` modifier for SwiftUI.

**Android SDK** integrates via gradle dependencies with `AmplitudeEngagement` class, supporting Jetpack Compose through `.amplitudeView` modifier and traditional views using `contentDescription` or `tag` selectors.

**React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) works with `@amplitude/analytics-react-native` and includes deep linking configuration through `handleURL()` function.

## Analytics and Experimentation

The platform provides comprehensive analytics through Amplitude event tracking, capturing events such as Guide Viewed, Guide Completed, Survey Submitted, and Survey Abandoned. Integration with Amplitude Experiment enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, with variant configuration and performance tracking through insights dashboards.

## Advanced Features and Customization

**Targeting and Personalization**: The platform supports sophisticated targeting through user segmentation, behavioral triggers (element appearance/clicks, time delays, rage clicks, user confusion), session properties, and page targeting with URL matching patterns. The "Personalize with Variables" feature allows dynamic insertion of client-side user properties into content.

**Theming and Styling**: Custom CSS styling is available for web SDK implementations, with comprehensive theme management including colors, typography, form controls, and animations. The Theme Editor provides Brand controls and Component editor sections for detailed customization.

**Localization**: Multi-language support through SDK locale configuration, with content translation via web interface, AI localization, or XLIFF file upload, including fallback behavior configuration.

**Permissions and Access Control**: Role-based permission system with five access levels (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) that override base Amplitude user roles to provide granular control over viewing, editing, publishing, and experiment execution.

## Broader Ecosystem Integration

Guides and Surveys integrates deeply with the Amplitude ecosystem, leveraging Amplitude Analytics for event tracking, Amplitude Experiment for A/B testing, and supporting proxy configurations through AWS CloudFront for enterprise deployments. The platform supports Content Security Policy (CSP) compliance and offers preview modes for testing and validation before deployment.

The Resource Center component extends the platform's capabilities by connecting to external documentation repositories through website scraping, with advanced filtering options and content management features that enable organizations to create comprehensive self-service support experiences.
