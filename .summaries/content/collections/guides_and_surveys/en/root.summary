# Amplitude Guides and Surveys

## Product Overview

Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive solution for creating in-product messages, interactive guides, and feedback collection mechanisms. The product helps teams improve user experience, facilitate product learning, collect feedback, and enhance key metrics like retention, activation, and engagement. It serves as an alternative to traditional popup components and is designed for cross-functional use by product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams.

The platform offers two primary components:

1. **Guides**: In-product messages that help users complete tasks or explore features using behavioral triggers and rate-limiting mechanisms to avoid disruption.

2. **Surveys**: Targeted feedback collection tools with specialized templates for measuring customer satisfaction, gathering user feedback, and evaluating product experiences.

## Key Features and Components

### Guides

Guides are available in five form factors:

1. **Modal**: Full-screen overlays for important announcements
2. **Popover**: Contextual information bubbles that point to UI elements
3. **Pin**: Small indicators that expand when clicked
4. **Tooltip**: Subtle informational elements that appear on hover
5. **Banner**: Horizontal messages that appear at the top or bottom of the screen

Guide templates include:
- **Tour**: Step-by-step instructions for product exploration
- **Announcement**: Single-step messages for important updates
- **Checklist**: Multi-step guides for complex tasks
- **Banner**: Persistent notifications
- **Tooltip**: Contextual help for specific UI elements

### Surveys

Survey templates include:
- **NPS (Net Promoter Score)**: Measures customer satisfaction and loyalty
- **User Feedback**: Customizable questions for detailed feedback
- **Rating**: Collects initial reactions to product experiences

Survey blocks include various rating types:
- Stars
- Rating labels
- Emoji
- NPS (Net Promoter Score)

Surveys support conditional logic for creating dynamic response paths based on user input.

### Setup and Targeting

Both guides and surveys use the same setup and targeting system, which includes:
- Audience targeting based on user segments
- Trigger conditions (when/where guides appear)
- Priority settings for managing multiple guides
- Display limits to prevent overwhelming users
- Guide statuses (draft/published/scheduled)
- Active state behavior with tiebreaker rules

### Analytics and Analysis

The platform provides comprehensive analytics through:
- **Overview Tab**: Shows performance metrics, filter cards, and interaction tracking
- **Insights Tab**: For aggregate survey data analysis
- **Responses Tab**: For viewing individual user feedback

For surveys specifically, analysis capabilities include:
- Type-specific insights (e.g., NPS breakdown into promoters/passives/detractors)
- Time-based analysis
- Response filtering and sorting
- Microscope integration for deeper user-level insights

### Experimentation

Integration with Amplitude Experiment allows:
