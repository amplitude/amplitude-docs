Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to improve user retention, activation, and engagement through targeted onboarding experiences and feedback collection. The platform enables product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams to deploy contextual guidance and gather user insights directly within their applications.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of three primary components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** provide interactive in-product guidance through five distinct form factors: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual bubbles), Pin (persistent elements), Tooltip (hover information), Banner (notification bars), and Checklist (task lists). These guides support multi-step experiences with advanced customization including z-index positioning, text animations with typewriter effects, and interactive blocks containing buttons, images, and videos.

**Surveys** enable targeted feedback collection using four specialized block types: Rating blocks (supporting Stars, NPS, Emoji, and custom Rating labels), Long answer blocks for detailed responses, Short answer blocks for brief input, and List blocks for multiple choice options. The survey system implements conditional logic for dynamic response paths and supports pre-filling with user properties.

**Resource Center** functions as an intelligent help widget that integrates external documentation repositories, provides semantic search capabilities, displays recommended content through Autopilot automation, and offers quick links with customizable call-to-action buttons. The Resource Center can scrape website content, manage article visibility through draft/published states, and serve personalized landing pages.

## Multi-Platform SDK Implementation

The platform provides native SDKs across multiple platforms with consistent initialization patterns:

**Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with the Amplitude Browser SDK through `engagement.init()` and `engagement.boot()` methods, supporting third-party analytics providers like Segment and Google Tag Manager integration. Key methods include `forwardEvent()` for event-based triggers, `setThemeMode()` for appearance management, and `addCallback()` for custom button actions.

**iOS SDK** (`AmplitudeEngagement`) supports Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods installation, utilizing `accessibilityIdentifier` for element targeting and `amplitudeView` for pin/tooltip guides. The SDK provides `AmplitudeBootOptions` for user/device ID configuration and supports custom URL schemes for preview mode.

**Android SDK** (`amplitude-engagement-android`) requires Android API Level 24+ and Kotlin 1.8.22+, implementing `AmplitudeEngagement` class initialization with `AmplitudeBootOptions` and `AmplitudeEndUser` configuration. The SDK includes screen tracking capabilities and AndroidManifest.xml intent filter setup for preview functionality.

**React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) provides deep linking support through `handleURL()` method and integrates with `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` for persistence.

## Advanced Targeting and Experimentation

The platform implements sophisticated targeting mechanisms through user segmentation (All Users vs Targeted Users with property/cohort filtering) and behavioral triggers including element appearance/clicks, time delays, smart delay, rage click detection, user confusion detection, and custom event tracking. Page targeting supports URL matching patterns with CSS selector and XPath expressions.

**Amplitude Experiment Integration** enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, with variant configuration, exposure event tracking, and performance analytics through the insights dashboard. Experiments support treatment vs control groups with configurable rollout percentages.

## Analytics and Performance Monitoring

The platform provides comprehensive analytics through Amplitude event tracking with standardized properties including Lifecycle UUID, Step ID, Step Index, and Variant ID for A/B testing. Key events include Guide Engaged/Completed/Dismissed, Survey Submitted/Abandoned/Completed, and Tooltip Marker Viewed, with rage close detection and debug mode filtering.

**Survey Analysis Features** include the Insights tab for aggregate data with NPS scoring (promoters/detractors/passives), type-specific insights, and filtering capabilities. The Responses tab enables individual user response analysis with sorting, filtering, and column pinning options. Time-based engagement charts integrate with Microscope for session replay analysis.

## Localization and Customization

The platform supports multilingual deployment through SDK locale initialization and Project settings configuration. Translation workflows utilize both web interface and .xliff file methods for serving localized content with fallback behavior and language resolution.

**Themes System** provides comprehensive branding customization through the Theme Editor with Brand controls and Component editor sections. Customization options include accent colors, Google Fonts typography, form controls styling, widget dimensions, CSS properties configuration, and animation settings for platform-specific deployment.

## Permission Management and Deployment

The platform implements a five-tier permission system (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) that overrides base Amplitude user roles, providing granular access control for viewing, editing drafts, publishing, and running experiments. Content management supports Draft/Published/Schedule status with priority levels (Urgent/High/Medium/Low) and display limits with cooldown periods.

**Testing and Preview Capabilities** include preview mode for condition verification (trigger, limit, throttle), troubleshooting tools with Reset User History and Ignore Throttle Limits options, and live testing through cohort targeting with manual event triggering.

The platform integrates with proxy configurations using AWS CloudFront for domain blocking circumvention, supports Content Security Policy (CSP) nonce configuration, and provides serverZone options for EU/US data residency compliance.
