Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user engagement platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to enhance user onboarding, collect feedback, and improve retention, activation, and engagement metrics. The platform enables product, growth, and product marketing teams to create contextual, interactive experiences directly within their applications.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of three primary components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** are interactive, multi-step experiences designed for user onboarding, feature announcements, and task completion guidance. They support five distinct form factors: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual bubbles), Pin (persistent markers), Tooltip (hover-triggered help), Banner (top/bottom notifications), and Checklist (task-oriented workflows). Guides utilize behavioral triggers including element appearance/clicks, time delays, rage clicks, user confusion detection, and custom event tracking.

**Surveys** focus on feedback collection through four specialized block types: Rating (Stars, NPS, Emoji, Rating labels), Long answer, Short answer, and List (multiple choice). Surveys support conditional logic for dynamic response branching and utilize a subset of guide form factors (modal, popover, pin). The platform provides comprehensive analytics through the Insights tab for aggregate metrics and the Responses tab for individual user data, with CSV export capabilities up to 10,000 responses.

**Resource Center** functions as a help widget that integrates search functionality, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. It features an Autopilot system that uses semantic search algorithms to automatically generate article recommendations by analyzing page content and surfacing relevant materials from configured content repositories.

## Multi-Platform SDK Ecosystem

The platform supports comprehensive cross-platform deployment through specialized SDKs:

**Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with the Amplitude Browser SDK as a plugin, supports third-party analytics providers like Segment, and includes Google Tag Manager templates. Key methods include `engagement.init()`, `engagement.boot()`, `engagement.forwardEvent()`, and `engagement.gs.show()` for programmatic control.

**iOS SDK** (`Amplitude-Engagement-Swift`) supports Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods installation, utilizes `AmplitudeEngagement` class initialization, and implements element targeting through `accessibilityIdentifier` and `amplitudeView` modifier for SwiftUI.

**Android SDK** (`amplitude-engagement-android`) integrates with Jetpack Compose using `.amplitudeView` modifier and supports non-Compose views through `contentDescription` and `tag` properties for element targeting.

**React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) provides deep linking support via `handleURL()` method and plugin booting with user/device ID configuration.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Lifecycle UUID** serves as the primary event grouping mechanism for analytics, while **Step ID** and **Step Index** properties track user progression through multi-step experiences. **Variant ID** enables A/B testing capabilities through Amplitude Experiment integration.

**Form Factors** define the visual presentation layer with specific customization properties including position controls, layout options, z-index management, and interactive elements. **Triggers** encompass behavioral conditions that activate guides/surveys, including smart delays, element interactions, and custom event tracking.

**Targeting** utilizes user segmentation, session properties via `setSessionProperty()`, page targeting with URL matching patterns, and priority levels (urgent, high, medium, low) with tiebreaker rules for conflict resolution.

**Throttling** controls artifact appearance frequency through configurable limits across time periods (day/week/month/session), with separate settings for guides versus surveys to manage user experience quality.

## Advanced Features and Integrations

**Experimentation** integrates with Amplitude Experiment to support A/B tests and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, including variant configuration, exposure event handling, and insights dashboard analytics for treatment vs control performance tracking.

**Localization** enables multi-language content delivery through SDK locale configuration, project language settings, fallback behavior, and content translation via web interface, AI localization with Claude, or XLIFF file upload workflows.

**Personalization** utilizes the "Personalize with Variables" feature to dynamically insert client-side user properties into text blocks with configurable fallback values when properties are unavailable.

**Analytics Integration** provides comprehensive event tracking including Survey Submitted/Abandoned events, Guide Completed/Dismissed events, Tooltip Marker Viewed tracking, and Rage Closed event detection, with Microscope integration for session replay analysis.

## Customization and Theming

**Themes** enable comprehensive branding customization through the Theme Editor with Brand controls and Component editor sections, supporting accent colors, Google Fonts typography, form controls styling, widget dimensions, CSS properties configuration, and platform-specific themes for web/mobile.

**Custom CSS** (beta feature, web SDK only) provides CSS class selectors for targeting form factors and survey elements using `amplitude-engagement` CSS classes for advanced styling control.

## Management and Permissions

The platform implements a five-tier permission system (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) that overrides base Amplitude user roles to provide granular access control for viewing, editing drafts, publishing, and running experiments within the Guides and Surveys module.

**Templates** create reusable starting points for guides and surveys with visibility management, blue banner indicators, and integration with the Create Guide/Survey workflow. **Tags** enable organization through individual or bulk tagging with filtering capabilities and bulk operations for campaign, feature, or team-based categorization.

**Testing and Preview** functionality includes preview mode for condition verification (trigger, limit, throttle), troubleshooting tools, cohort targeting for live testing, and user history management through Reset User History and Ignore Throttle Limits options.

The platform integrates with proxy configurations using AWS CloudFront for unified distributions, supports Content Security Policy (CSP) nonce requirements, and provides comprehensive API endpoints through the `/sdk/*` path pattern for state persistence and configuration management.
