Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to improve user onboarding, collect feedback, and enhance retention, activation, and engagement metrics. The platform targets product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams seeking to create seamless user journeys through contextual guidance and feedback collection.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The platform consists of three core components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** provide interactive user onboarding and feature discovery through five form factors: Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner, and Checklist. Each form factor supports multi-step functionality, customizable positioning, and interactive blocks including buttons, images, and videos. Guides utilize five template types (Tour, Announcement, Checklists, Banners, Tooltips) and incorporate behavioral triggers, strike detection, and rate-limiting mechanisms.

**Surveys** enable targeted feedback collection using four unique block types: Rating (Stars, NPS, Emoji, Rating labels), Long answer, Short answer, and List blocks. Surveys support conditional logic for dynamic response paths and utilize a subset of guide form factors (modal, popover, pin). Survey analysis includes aggregate metrics through the Insights tab and individual response data via the Responses tab.

**Resource Center** functions as a help widget that integrates with the Guides and Surveys SDK, providing search functionality, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. It features Autopilot functionality that uses semantic search to automatically generate content recommendations from documentation repositories.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**AmplitudeEngagement** - The core SDK class for initializing and managing guides and surveys across platforms (web, iOS, Android, React Native)

**Form Factors** - The visual presentation styles: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual bubbles), Pin (persistent elements), Tooltip (hover information), Banner (top/bottom bars), Checklist (task lists)

**Behavioral Triggers** - Event-based activation mechanisms including element appearance/clicks, time delays, smart delay, rage click, user confusion, and custom event tracking

**Strike Detection** - System for tracking user interaction patterns to optimize guide timing and relevance

**Rate-limiting/Throttling** - Controls for managing guide and survey frequency per user across different time periods (day/week/month/session)

**Lifecycle UUID** - Unique identifier for tracking user progression through guide/survey experiences

**Variant ID** - Identifier used for A/B testing and experimentation within the Amplitude Experiment integration

**Recommendation Sets** - Curated collections of articles and content for the Resource Center, configurable with targeting and priority levels

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Guides and Surveys integrates deeply with the broader Amplitude ecosystem through multiple touchpoints:

**Analytics Integration**: Events are automatically tracked in Amplitude Analytics with comprehensive event properties including Guide Engaged, Guide Step Completed, Survey Submitted, Survey Abandoned, and Tooltip Marker Viewed events. Integration with Microscope provides session replay capabilities for analyzing user interactions.

**Amplitude Experiment Integration**: Supports A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys with variant configuration, exposure event handling, and performance analytics through the insights dashboard.

**Third-party Integrations**: Compatible with Segment analytics, Google Tag Manager, and other analytics providers through the `forwardEvent()` method for event tracking.

**Multi-platform SDK Support**: Unified experience across web (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`), iOS (AmplitudeEngagement-Swift), Android (amplitude-engagement-android), and React Native (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) platforms.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Core SDK Methods**:
- `engagement.init()` and `engagement.boot()` for initialization
- `engagement.gs.show()` and `engagement.gs.reset()` for guide management
- `engagement.forwardEvent()` for event tracking
- `engagement.setRouter()` for single-page application routing
- `engagement.updateLanguage()` for localization

**Mobile SDK Methods**:
- `AmplitudeEngagement.initialize()` with API key configuration
- `boot()` with user/device ID and properties
- `show()`, `reset()`, `list()` for guide management
- `handlePreviewLinkIntent()` for preview mode testing

**Resource Center API Patterns**:
- `/sdk/*` path pattern for API routing through proxy configurations
- `/sdk/admin/config` endpoint for preview mode functionality
- Website scraper functionality for content repository synchronization

**Configuration Options**:
- ServerZone selection (US/EU) for data residency
- Proxy setup with `serverUrl` and `cdnUrl` for enterprise deployments
- Content Security Policy (CSP) nonce support for security compliance
- Theme management with `ThemeMode` (lightMode, darkMode, auto)

The platform includes comprehensive permission management with five access levels (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator), localization support through SDK locale configuration and XLIFF file workflows, and advanced targeting capabilities using segments, cohorts, page rules, and priority levels. Testing is facilitated through preview mode with condition verification, and the system supports template creation for reusable guide and survey configurations.
