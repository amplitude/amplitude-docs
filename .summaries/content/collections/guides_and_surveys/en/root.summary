# Amplitude Guides and Surveys

Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product messaging and feedback collection platform designed to improve user experience, facilitate product adoption, and gather actionable user insights. The product serves as an alternative to traditional popup components, helping product teams, growth teams, and marketing teams to guide users through their product journey while collecting valuable feedback.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Guides
Guides are in-product messages that help users complete tasks or explore features using behavioral triggers. They come in five form factors:
- **Modal**: Full-screen overlays for important announcements
- **Popover**: Contextual messages that point to specific UI elements
- **Pin**: Small indicators that expand when clicked
- **Tooltip**: Subtle hints that appear on hover
- **Banner**: Persistent messages at the top or bottom of the screen

These form factors can be implemented using five templates:
- **Tour**: Step-by-step instructions for product exploration
- **Announcement**: Important updates or new feature notifications
- **Checklist**: Task completion tracking for onboarding
- **Banner**: Persistent notifications
- **Tooltip**: Contextual help for specific UI elements

### Surveys
Surveys enable targeted feedback collection with three template options:
- **NPS (Net Promoter Score)**: Measures customer satisfaction and loyalty
- **User Feedback**: Custom questions for detailed insights
- **Rating**: Gathers initial reactions to product experiences

Survey blocks include various rating types (Stars, Rating labels, Emoji, NPS) and support conditional logic for creating dynamic response paths based on user input.

### Analytics
The platform provides comprehensive analytics for tracking guide and survey performance, including:
- Views and completions metrics
- User engagement patterns
- Survey response analysis
- Real-time interaction feeds
- Segmentation capabilities

### Experimentation
Integration with Amplitude Experiment allows for A/B testing and Multi-armed Bandit experiments to optimize guide and survey performance.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

### SDK Integration
The Guides and Surveys SDK is the foundation for deploying interactive guides and surveys on websites or applications. It can be integrated through:
- Amplitude Browser SDK
- Third-party analytics providers
- Google Tag Manager

The SDK provides methods for theme management, router configuration, and guide/survey control.

### Localization
The localization feature allows content to be served in multiple languages without creating duplicates. This requires:
- SDK implementation updates to specify user locale
- Project settings configuration to define supported languages
- Fallback behaviors for missing translations

### Theming
Themes control the appearance of guides and surveys, including:
- Colors and typography
- Component styles
- Animations
- Widget dimensions
- Light/dark mode support

### Testing and Preview
Preview mode allows testing functionality before launch, including:
- Condition status checking (trigger, limit, throttle)
- User history reset
- Throttle limit bypassing
- Live testing with targeted cohorts

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Guide-Related Terms
- **Form Factors**: The visual presentation styles of guides (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner)
- **Templates**: Pre-designed guide structures for specific use cases
- **Trigger Conditions**: Rules determining when and where guides appear
- **Display Limits**: Restrictions on how often guides can be shown
- **Smart Delay**: Automatic timing adjustment to avoid disrupting user experience
- **CSS Selector Triggers**: Targeting guides to specific UI elements

### Survey-Related Terms
- **NPS (Net Promoter Score)**: A metric measuring customer loyalty on a 0-10 scale
- **Promoters/Passives/Detractors**: Categories of NPS respondents (9-10, 7-8, 0-6)
- **Conditional Logic**: Rules that change survey flow based on previous answers
- **Rating Blocks**: Survey components for collecting numerical or emoji-based feedback

### Analytics Terms
- **Lifecycle UUID**: Unique identifier for tracking guide/survey instances
- **Viewed Event**: Triggered when a guide/survey is displayed
- **Dismissed Event**: Triggered when a user closes a guide/survey
- **Completed Event**: Triggered when a user finishes all steps
- **Survey Submitted**: Triggered when a survey is completed
- **Survey Abandoned**: Triggered when a user leaves without completing
- **Variant ID**: Identifier for experiment variations

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Guides and Surveys integrates with the broader Amplitude ecosystem:

### Amplitude Analytics
- Events from guides and surveys flow into Amplitude Analytics
- Microscope integration for detailed user-level analysis
- Filter cards for segmentation and cohort analysis

### Amplitude Experiment
- A/B testing capabilities for guides and surveys
- Multi-armed Bandit optimization
- Variant configuration and management
- Performance analysis through the Insights dashboard

### User Permissions System
Guides and Surveys has its own permission system that can override a user's base Amplitude role:
- **No Access**: Cannot view or edit guides/surveys
- **Viewer**: Can view but not edit
- **Member**: Can create and edit drafts
- **Manager**: Can publish and edit live guides/surveys
- **Administrator**: Full access including permission management

## API and Technical Implementation

### SDK Methods
```javascript
// Initialize the SDK
amplitude.engagement.boot({
  client: {
    configuration: {
      apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY',
      serverUrl: 'https://gs.amplitude.com',
      cdnUrl: 'https://cdn.amplitude.com'
    }
  }
});

// Show a specific guide or survey
amplitude.engagement.show('GUIDE_ID');

// Reset user history
amplitude.engagement.resetUserHistory();

// Set theme mode
amplitude.engagement.setThemeMode('light' | 'dark' | 'system');
```

### Proxy Configuration
For environments with domain blocking, a reverse proxy can be set up using AWS CloudFront with dual origins:
- Origin for static assets: cdn.amplitude.com
- Origin for API traffic: gs.amplitude.com

### Content Security Policy
When implementing the SDK, the following domains need to be allowed:
- connect-src: https://gs.amplitude.com
- script-src: https://cdn.amplitude.com
- style-src: https://cdn.amplitude.com
- img-src: https://cdn.amplitude.com
