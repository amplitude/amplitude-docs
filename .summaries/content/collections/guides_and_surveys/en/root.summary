Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to help product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams improve user retention, activation, and engagement through targeted onboarding experiences and feedback collection.

## Core Product Features

The platform consists of two primary components: **Guides** and **Surveys**. Guides are non-intrusive user engagement tools that provide step-by-step instructions, feature announcements, and interactive experiences. Surveys enable targeted feedback collection with specialized rating systems including NPS scoring, emoji ratings, and star ratings.

The system offers five distinct **form factors** for content delivery:
- **Modal**: Classic, horizontal split, and vertical split layouts for prominent messaging
- **Popover**: Contextual overlays attached to specific elements
- **Pin**: Persistent markers with overlay highlighting capabilities
- **Tooltip**: Hover or click-reveal information bubbles
- **Banner**: Top or bottom positioning with sticky options for persistent messaging

## Template System and Use Cases

**Guide Templates** include:
- **Tour**: Multi-step product walkthroughs for feature exploration
- **Announcement**: Single-step communications for new features or updates
- **Checklists**: Task-oriented guides for user onboarding completion
- **Banners**: Persistent messaging for important communications
- **Tooltips**: Contextual help and feature explanations

**Survey Templates** focus on:
- **NPS Surveys**: Net Promoter Score collection with automatic promoter/detractor/passive categorization
- **User Feedback**: Open-ended response collection
- **Rating Surveys**: Multi-format rating collection (stars, emoji, labels, NPS variants)

## Technical Architecture and Integration

The platform is built around the **@amplitude/engagement-browser SDK**, which integrates with the Amplitude Browser SDK 2.0 as a plugin. Key SDK methods include:

- `engagement.init()` and `engagement.boot()` for initialization
- `engagement.gs.show()`, `engagement.gs.reset()`, `engagement.gs.closeAll()` for guide/survey control
- `engagement.forwardEvent()` for analytics integration
- `engagement.setThemeMode()` and `engagement.updateLanguage()` for customization

The SDK supports integration with third-party analytics providers like Segment and Google Tag Manager, enabling comprehensive event tracking across platforms.

## Targeting and Trigger System

The platform features sophisticated **Setup and Targeting** capabilities:

**User Targeting**: Supports both "All Users" and "Targeted Users" with segment-based filtering
**Trigger Conditions**: 
- Element appearance detection using CSS selectors and XPath expressions
- Time-based delays with smart delay algorithms
- Rage click detection for user frustration identification
- User confusion detection
- Custom event tracking integration

**Page Targeting**: URL pattern matching with query parameter support
**Priority System**: Four-tier priority levels (Urgent/High/Medium/Low) with tiebreaker logic for multiple eligible experiences

## Analytics and Experimentation

The platform includes comprehensive analytics through the **Overview tab**, providing:
- Views and completions tracking with time-based charts
- Rage closes percentage measurement
- Real-time interactions feed
- Microscope integration for session replay analysis

**Amplitude Experiment Integration** enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, with variant configuration, exposure event tracking, and performance analytics through the Insights dashboard.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Lifecycle UUID**: Unique identifier for tracking user journey progression
**Step ID/Step Index**: Navigation tracking within multi-step experiences
**Variant ID**: A/B testing variant identification
**Form Factors**: The five display modes (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner)
**Conditional Logic**: Dynamic response branching for surveys based on user input
**Strike Detection**: System for identifying when users should receive guidance
**Rate-limiting**: Throttling mechanisms to prevent over-engagement

## Ecosystem Integration

The platform integrates deeply with the broader Amplitude ecosystem:
- **Amplitude Analytics**: Native event tracking with predefined event taxonomy
- **Amplitude Experiment**: A/B testing and experimentation framework
- **Microscope**: Session replay integration for behavioral analysis
- **Cohort Targeting**: User segmentation for precise targeting

## Advanced Features

**Localization Support**: XLIFF file-based translation workflows with SDK locale initialization for multilingual deployments

**Theme System**: Comprehensive Theme Editor with Brand controls for accent colors, typography, form controls, and Component editor for reusable elements

**Proxy Configuration**: AWS CloudFront reverse proxy setup for circumventing domain blocking while maintaining performance

**Permission Management**: Five-tier role system (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) with granular access control for viewing, editing, publishing, and experiment execution

**Testing and Preview**: Preview mode with condition verification, live testing capabilities, and troubleshooting tools for pre-launch validation

The platform serves as a comprehensive solution for in-product user communication, combining sophisticated targeting, analytics, and customization capabilities within the Amplitude product ecosystem.
