Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user engagement platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to enhance user onboarding, collect feedback, and improve retention, activation, and engagement metrics. The platform enables product, growth, and product marketing teams to create contextual, non-intrusive messaging experiences directly within their applications.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of three primary components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** are interactive, multi-step experiences designed for user onboarding and feature exploration. They support six template types (Tour, Announcement, Checklists, Carousel, Banners, Tooltips) and utilize five form factors (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner, and Checklist) with advanced positioning, multi-step configurations, and interactive blocks including buttons, images, and videos.

**Surveys** focus on feedback collection through four unique block types (Rating, Long answer, Short answer, List) with conditional logic for dynamic response branching. Survey templates include NPS, User feedback, Rating, and mobile Carousel formats, supporting various rating types including Stars, NPS, Emoji, and Rating labels.

**Resource Center** functions as an intelligent help widget that integrates external documentation repositories, provides semantic search capabilities, and offers personalized content recommendations through its Autopilot feature, which automatically surfaces relevant articles based on page content analysis.

## SDK Integration and Multi-Platform Support

The platform provides comprehensive SDK support across web, iOS, Android, and React Native platforms:

- **Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with Amplitude Browser SDK, third-party analytics providers like Segment, and Google Tag Manager
- **iOS SDK** (`Amplitude-Engagement-Swift`) supports Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods installation with SwiftUI integration via `amplitudeView` modifier
- **Android SDK** (`amplitude-engagement-android`) provides Jetpack Compose support through `.amplitudeView` modifier and traditional view targeting via `contentDescription` and `tag` selectors
- **React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) offers cross-platform functionality with deep linking support

## Advanced Targeting and Personalization

The platform employs sophisticated targeting mechanisms including:

- **User Targeting**: Segment-based targeting with rollout percentages and bucketing units
- **Behavioral Triggers**: Element appearance/clicks, time delays, smart delay, rage click detection, user confusion detection, and custom event tracking
- **Page Targeting**: URL matching patterns with CSS Selector and XPath support
- **Priority Management**: Four-tier priority system (Urgent, High, Medium, Low) with tiebreaker logic
- **Personalization**: Dynamic content insertion using client-side user properties with fallback values

## Analytics and Experimentation

Comprehensive analytics tracking is implemented through Amplitude with events prefixed `[Guides-Surveys]`, capturing:

- **Guide Events**: Guide Viewed, Guide Completed, Guide Engaged, Guide Dismissed
- **Survey Events**: Survey Submitted, Survey Abandoned, Survey Response
- **Resource Center Events**: Article interactions and search behaviors
- **Common Properties**: App Type, Lifecycle UUID, Step ID, Variant ID, Source type

The platform integrates with Amplitude Experiment for A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments, providing variant configuration, exposure event handling, and performance analytics through the Insights dashboard.

## Content Management and Localization

The system supports enterprise-level content management through:

- **Template System**: Reusable starting points for guides and surveys with visibility management
- **Themes**: Comprehensive branding customization including colors, typography, form controls, and animations
- **Localization**: Multi-language support via SDK locale configuration, XLIFF file workflows, and AI-powered translation using Claude
- **Tags**: Organizational system for content categorization and bulk operations

## Testing and Quality Assurance

Robust testing capabilities include:

- **Preview Mode**: Condition verification (trigger, limit, throttle) with real-time status indicators
- **Live Testing**: Cohort-based testing with user history management
- **Debug Features**: `_startNudgeDebug()` for desktop app previewing and condition troubleshooting

## Enterprise Features and Permissions

The platform provides enterprise-grade access control through a five-tier permission system (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) that overrides base Amplitude user roles, offering granular control over viewing, editing, publishing, and experiment execution capabilities.

Additional enterprise features include proxy support via AWS CloudFront for unified content delivery, Content Security Policy (CSP) compliance, custom CSS styling capabilities, and comprehensive throttling controls to manage artifact display frequency across different time periods (day/week/month/session).

The platform's architecture enables seamless integration into existing product ecosystems while maintaining performance through intelligent caching, rate limiting, and optimized content delivery mechanisms.
