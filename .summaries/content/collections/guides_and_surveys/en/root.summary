Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to improve user onboarding, engagement, and feedback collection. The platform enables product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams to create contextual, interactive experiences that drive retention, activation, and engagement metrics through targeted user guidance and survey collection.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of three primary components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** provide interactive user onboarding and engagement through five distinct form factors: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual callouts), Pin (persistent elements), Tooltip (hover information), Banner (page-wide notifications), and Checklist (task-oriented workflows). Each form factor supports multi-step functionality, advanced triggers, and customizable actions including visit link, click element, show guide, and run callback functions.

**Surveys** enable targeted feedback collection through four specialized block types: Rating blocks (supporting Stars, NPS, Emoji, and Rating labels), Long answer blocks, Short answer blocks, and List blocks with multiple choice options. Surveys support conditional logic for dynamic response paths and utilize a subset of guide form factors (modal, popover, pin) for deployment.

**Resource Center** functions as an intelligent help widget that integrates with the Guides and Surveys SDK, providing search functionality, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. The Resource Center features Autopilot, which uses semantic search algorithms to automatically generate content recommendations from documentation repositories based on page context.

## SDK Implementation and Platform Support

The platform supports multi-platform deployment through dedicated SDKs:

- **Web SDK**: `@amplitude/engagement-browser` package with methods like `engagement.init()`, `engagement.boot()`, `engagement.gs.show()`, and `engagement.gs.reset()`
- **Android SDK**: `AmplitudeEngagement` class with gradle dependencies, requiring Android API Level 24+ and Kotlin 1.8.22+
- **iOS SDK**: Swift Package Manager/CocoaPods installation with `AmplitudeEngagement` initialization and `accessibilityIdentifier` targeting
- **React Native SDK**: `@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native` package with deep linking support via `handleURL()` method

All SDKs support screen tracking, element targeting, theme management (LIGHT/DARK/SYSTEM modes), preview mode configuration, and event forwarding for analytics integration.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Lifecycle UUID**: Unique identifier tracking user interaction sessions across guides and surveys
**Step ID and Step Index**: Sequential identifiers for multi-step experience navigation
**Variant ID**: A/B testing configuration identifier for experiment management
**Strike Detection**: Behavioral trigger mechanism that monitors user interaction patterns
**Rate-limiting**: Throttling system preventing experience over-exposure
**Smart Delay**: Intelligent timing mechanism that optimizes experience delivery based on user behavior
**Rage Click**: Trigger mechanism detecting user frustration through rapid clicking patterns
**Bucketing Unit**: User segmentation mechanism for rollout percentage targeting
**Recommendation Sets**: Curated content collections for Resource Center personalization
**Semantic Search**: AI-powered content discovery algorithm for automatic recommendations

## Targeting and Experimentation Framework

The platform provides sophisticated targeting capabilities through multiple mechanisms:

**User Targeting** supports "All Users" or "Targeted Users" with segment-based filtering, rollout percentages, and cohort integration. **Trigger Mechanisms** include element appearance/clicks, time delays, smart delay, rage click detection, user confusion patterns, and event tracking integration.

**Page Targeting** utilizes URL matching (exact matches, contains, regex patterns) with CSS Selector and XPath targeting for precise element identification. **Priority Levels** (Urgent, High, Medium, Low) manage experience precedence with tiebreaker logic for multiple eligible experiences.

**Amplitude Experiment Integration** enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments with variant configuration, exposure event handling, and performance analytics through the insights dashboard.

## Analytics and Measurement

The platform integrates deeply with Amplitude Analytics, tracking comprehensive event schemas including:

**Common Events**: Viewed, Dismissed, Completed with properties like Lifecycle UUID, Step ID, and Variant ID
**Guide-Specific Events**: Guide Engaged, Guide Step Completed, Tooltip Marker Viewed, Rage Closed
**Survey-Specific Events**: Survey Submitted, Survey Abandoned with response data capture

Analytics integration supports third-party providers including Segment, Google Tag Manager, and custom implementations through `forwardEvent()` methods. The Insights tab provides aggregate metrics, NPS breakdowns, completion trends, and Microscope integration for session replay analysis.

## Content Management and Localization

**Templates** provide reusable starting points for guides and surveys with pre-configured designs and placeholder content. **Tags** enable organizational structure with bulk operations and filtering capabilities. **Themes** allow comprehensive branding customization through the Theme Editor with Brand controls and Component editor sections.

**Localization** supports multi-language content delivery through SDK locale configuration, project language settings, fallback behavior management, and content translation via web interface, AI localization (Claude), or XLIFF file upload workflows.

## Permissions and Access Control

The platform implements a three-tier permission system (Viewer, Member, Manager) that overrides base Amplitude user roles, providing granular access control for viewing, editing drafts, publishing, and running experiments. Administrator roles maintain full access across all functionality.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

**Proxy Configuration** supports AWS CloudFront setup as reverse proxy with dual origins (cdn.amplitude.com for static assets, gs.amplitude.com for API requests) and specific cache behaviors for the critical `/sdk/*` path pattern. **Server Zones** support US/EU data residency requirements with configurable `serverUrl` and `cdnUrl` parameters.

The platform integrates with Content Security Policy (CSP) through nonce configuration and supports Single Page Application (SPA) routing through `engagement.setRouter()` methods for seamless user experience delivery across modern web architectures.
