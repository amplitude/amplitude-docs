Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user engagement platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to enhance user onboarding, collect feedback, and improve retention, activation, and engagement metrics. The platform enables product, growth, and product marketing teams to create contextual, non-intrusive messaging experiences directly within their applications.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of three primary components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** are interactive, multi-step experiences designed for user onboarding and feature exploration. They support six template types (Tour, Announcement, Checklists, Carousel, Banners, Tooltips) and utilize behavioral triggers, strike detection, and rate-limiting mechanisms to ensure optimal user engagement without overwhelming users.

**Surveys** function as feedback collection tools with four unique block types (Rating, Long answer, Short answer, List) that support conditional logic for dynamic response branching. Survey templates include NPS, User feedback, Rating, Carousel, Banner Survey, and Tooltip Survey configurations, each optimized for specific feedback collection scenarios.

**Resource Center** operates as an intelligent help widget that integrates external documentation repositories and provides contextual assistance through search functionality, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. It features an Autopilot system that uses semantic search algorithms to automatically surface relevant articles based on page content analysis.

## Form Factors and Targeting System

The platform supports five distinct form factors (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner, and Checklist), each with extensive customization properties including position settings, layout options (classic, horizontal split, vertical split), button actions (visit link, click element, show guide/survey, run callback), and format settings like z-index, text animation, and click-outside-to-close behavior.

The sophisticated targeting system enables precise user segmentation through multiple mechanisms: user targeting (All Users vs Targeted Users with segments, rollout percentages, and bucketing units), trigger mechanisms (element appearance/clicks, time delays, smart delay, rage click, user confusion, event tracking), page targeting rules using CSS Selector and XPath targeting, and priority settings with tiebreaker logic for managing concurrent content.

## Multi-Platform SDK Implementation

The platform provides comprehensive SDK support across web, iOS, Android, and React Native platforms:

**Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with Amplitude Browser SDK, third-party analytics providers like Segment, and Google Tag Manager, offering methods like `engagement.init()`, `engagement.boot()`, `engagement.gs.show()`, and `engagement.gs.reset()` for programmatic control.

**iOS SDK** (`AmplitudeEngagement`) supports Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods installation, with element targeting using `accessibilityIdentifier` and `amplitudeView` modifier, theme management through `ThemeMode.DARK`/`ThemeMode.LIGHT`, and preview mode configuration with custom URL schemes.

**Android SDK** (`amplitude-engagement-android`) provides Jetpack Compose support through `.amplitudeView` modifier and traditional Android views using `contentDescription`/`tag` selectors, with screen tracking and preview mode configuration via `AndroidManifest.xml` intent-filter.

**React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) integrates with `analytics-react-native`, handles deep linking through `handleURL()`, and supports plugin booting with user/device IDs.

## Analytics and Experimentation Framework

The platform includes comprehensive analytics tracking with events prefixed `[Guides-Surveys]` in Amplitude, covering guide events (Guide Viewed, Guide Completed, Guide Engaged), survey events (Survey Submitted, Survey Abandoned), and Resource Center interactions. Common event properties include App Type, Lifecycle UUID, Step ID, Variant ID, and Source.type (nudge, trigger, sdk, share_link).

**Amplitude Experiment integration** enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, with variant configuration, experiment management, exposure event handling, and insights dashboard analytics for treatment vs control performance tracking.

**Survey analysis features** include the Insights tab for aggregate metrics and trends (with NPS and List survey type-specific breakdowns) and the Responses tab for individual user response data with CSV export capabilities up to 10k responses.

## Advanced Features and Customization

**Localization support** enables multi-language content delivery through SDK locale configuration, project language settings, fallback behavior, and content translation via web interface, AI localization with Claude, or XLIFF file upload workflows.

**Theme system** provides comprehensive branding customization through the Theme Editor with Brand controls and Component editor sections, supporting accent colors, Google fonts typography, form controls styling, widget dimensions, CSS properties, animations, and platform-specific themes.

**Personalization capabilities** include the "Personalize with Variables" feature for dynamically inserting client-side user properties into content, custom CSS styling (web SDK only, beta feature) with CSS class selectors for targeting form factors and survey elements, and callback integration for custom actions.

## Content Management and Organization

The platform features a robust content management system with **tags for organizing guides and surveys**, supporting bulk management operations, filtering capabilities, and integration with advanced throttling for rate-limiting strategies. **Templates system** enables creation of reusable starting points with visibility management and integration with the Create Guide/Survey workflow.

**Throttling configuration** includes global rate limiting with limit/period settings, time delays between sequential guides, and advanced throttling using tags for granular control over different content categories like campaigns, onboarding flows, and feature updates.

## Permissions and Testing

**Role-based permission system** provides five access levels (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) with specific capabilities for viewing, editing, publishing guides/surveys, and running experiments, managed through the Guides and Surveys > Permissions interface.

**Testing capabilities** include preview mode for verifying trigger, limit, and throttle conditions before launch, with troubleshooting tools like Reset User History, Ignore Throttle Limits, and manual event triggering, plus live testing using cohort targeting.

The platform integrates seamlessly with the broader Amplitude ecosystem, leveraging user segmentation, analytics data, and experimentation capabilities while providing specialized tools for in-product user engagement and feedback collection across web and mobile applications.
