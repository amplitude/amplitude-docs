Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to improve user onboarding, engagement, and feedback collection. The platform targets product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams seeking to enhance retention, activation, and engagement metrics through contextual user guidance and data collection.

## Core Product Components

The platform consists of three primary components that work together to create cohesive user experiences:

**Guides** provide interactive in-product guidance through five distinct form factors: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual bubbles), Pin (persistent elements), Tooltip (hover information), Banner (page-wide notifications), and Checklist (task-oriented workflows). Each form factor supports multi-step functionality, customizable positioning, advanced triggers, and interactive elements including buttons, images, and videos. Guides utilize behavioral triggers, strike detection, and rate-limiting mechanisms to ensure appropriate user engagement.

**Surveys** enable targeted feedback collection through four specialized block types: Rating (Stars, NPS, Emoji, Rating labels), Long answer, Short answer, and List blocks. These support conditional logic for dynamic response paths and utilize a subset of guide form factors (modal, popover, pin) to maintain consistency across the user experience.

**Resource Center** functions as a help widget that integrates with the Guides and Surveys SDK, providing search functionality, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. It features Autopilot functionality that uses semantic search algorithms to automatically generate content recommendations from external documentation repositories.

## Technical Architecture and Integration

The platform operates through dedicated SDKs across multiple platforms:

**Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with the Amplitude Browser SDK using `engagement.init()` and `engagement.boot()` methods, with support for third-party analytics providers, Google Tag Manager, and Content Security Policy configurations.

**Mobile SDKs** include iOS (`AmplitudeEngagement` class with Swift Package Manager/CocoaPods installation), Android (`amplitude-engagement-android` with gradle dependencies), and React Native (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) implementations, all supporting deep linking and preview mode functionality.

**API Integration** utilizes dual-origin architecture with `cdn.amplitude.com` for static assets and `gs.amplitude.com` for API requests with `/sdk/` prefix routing, supporting AWS CloudFront reverse proxy configurations for domain blocking circumvention.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Lifecycle UUID** serves as the primary identifier for tracking user interactions across guide and survey experiences. **Step ID** and **Step Index** provide granular tracking of multi-step experience progression. **Variant ID** enables A/B testing functionality through Amplitude Experiment integration.

**Form Factors** define the visual presentation method (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner, Checklist) with specific configuration properties including z-index positioning, text animation effects, and advanced trigger element interactions.

**Targeting** encompasses user segmentation (All Users vs Targeted Users), trigger mechanisms (element appearance/clicks, time delays, smart delay, rage click, user confusion, event tracking), page targeting rules using CSS selectors and XPath, and priority levels (Urgent, High, Medium, Low).

**Themes** provide comprehensive branding customization through the Theme Editor with Brand controls and Component editor sections, supporting platform-specific styling for web and mobile implementations.

## Analytics and Experimentation

The platform provides extensive analytics capabilities through Amplitude integration, tracking events including Guide Engaged, Guide Step Completed, Survey Submitted, Survey Abandoned, and Tooltip Marker Viewed. The analytics glossary defines common properties and events for comprehensive user interaction tracking, with Debug Mode filtering capabilities.

**Experiment Integration** with Amplitude Experiment enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, including variant configuration, exposure event handling, and insights dashboard analytics with performance overview metrics and time-based analysis.

**Survey Analysis** features include the Insights tab for aggregate metrics and trends (with NPS-specific breakdowns and Microscope integration) and the Responses tab for individual user response data with export and filtering capabilities.

## Localization and Content Management

The platform supports comprehensive localization through SDK locale initialization, Project settings language configuration, and three translation methods: web interface editing, AI-powered translation using Claude, and XLIFF file workflow integration. Translation fallback behavior ensures consistent user experiences across different locales.

**Resource Center Content Management** includes website scraper functionality for URL extraction, CSV/XML sitemap upload capabilities, content selector overrides, and sync error management through the Sync errors interface.

## Permissions and Access Control

The platform implements a three-tier permission system (Viewer, Member, Manager) that overrides base Amplitude user roles, providing granular access control for viewing, editing drafts, publishing, and running experiments. This extends to five access levels (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) with specific capabilities managed through the Guides and Surveys > Permissions interface.

## Testing and Quality Assurance

**Preview Mode** enables comprehensive testing of guides and surveys, allowing verification of trigger, limit, and throttle conditions before launch. The system provides condition status indicators (green/yellow/blue), Reset User History functionality, and cohort targeting for live testing scenarios.

The platform integrates seamlessly with the broader Amplitude ecosystem, leveraging existing user segmentation, analytics infrastructure, and experimentation capabilities while providing specialized tools for in-product user experience optimization.
