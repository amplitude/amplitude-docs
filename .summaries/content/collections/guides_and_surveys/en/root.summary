Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user engagement platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to improve user onboarding, collect feedback, and enhance retention through contextual guides and surveys. The platform targets product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams seeking to optimize user activation and engagement metrics through strategic in-product communication.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of three primary components working in concert:

**Guides System**: Interactive user guidance featuring five form factors (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner, and Checklist) with multi-step navigation capabilities. Guides support various templates including Tours for step-by-step onboarding, Announcements for feature releases, Checklists for task completion, Banners for persistent messaging, and Tooltips for contextual help.

**Surveys System**: Feedback collection tools built with four unique block types (Rating, Long answer, Short answer, List) that support conditional logic for dynamic response paths. Survey types include NPS (Net Promoter Score), Stars, Emoji, and Rating labels, utilizing a subset of guide form factors (modal, popover, pin).

**Resource Center**: A help widget that integrates with the SDK to provide search functionality, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. It features Autopilot functionality that uses semantic search to automatically surface relevant articles from documentation repositories based on page context.

## SDK Implementation and Platform Support

The platform provides comprehensive SDK support across multiple platforms:

- **Web SDK**: `@amplitude/engagement-browser` package with integration options for Amplitude Browser SDK, Segment analytics, and Google Tag Manager
- **iOS SDK**: AmplitudeEngagementSwift with Swift Package Manager/CocoaPods installation
- **Android SDK**: `amplitude-engagement-android` with Jetpack Compose support via `.amplitudeView` modifier
- **React Native SDK**: `@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native` with deep linking support

Key SDK methods include `engagement.init()`, `engagement.boot()`, `engagement.forwardEvent()`, and platform-specific targeting mechanisms using CSS selectors, XPath, `accessibilityIdentifier` (iOS), and `contentDescription`/`tag` properties (Android).

## Targeting and Personalization Framework

The platform employs sophisticated targeting mechanisms including:

**User Targeting**: Supports "All Users" or "Targeted Users" with segment-based filtering, rollout percentages, and bucketing units for controlled deployment.

**Trigger Systems**: Multiple trigger types including immediate display, element-based interactions, time delays, smart delay algorithms, rage click detection, user confusion patterns, and event-based triggers.

**Page Targeting**: URL matching patterns with CSS selector and XPath targeting for precise element interaction.

**Personalization**: "Personalize with Variables" feature dynamically inserts client-side user properties into content with fallback value support.

## Analytics and Experimentation

Comprehensive analytics integration with Amplitude provides detailed event tracking including:

**Core Events**: Guide/Survey Viewed, Dismissed, Completed, Engaged, Submitted, Abandoned, with properties like Lifecycle UUID, Step ID, Step Index, and Variant ID for A/B testing.

**Analysis Tools**: Insights tab for aggregate metrics and trends, Responses tab for individual user data with CSV export capabilities (up to 10k responses), and Microscope integration for session replay analysis.

**Experimentation**: Full Amplitude Experiment integration supporting A/B tests and multi-armed bandit experiments with variant configuration, exposure event handling, and performance analytics.

## Content Management and Localization

**Template System**: Reusable starting points for guides and surveys with visibility management and automatic "Template" suffix naming conventions.

**Themes**: Comprehensive branding customization through Theme Editor with Brand controls and Component editor sections, supporting colors, typography, form controls, widget dimensions, and animations.

**Localization**: Multi-language support with SDK locale configuration, AI-powered translation using Claude, XLIFF file workflows, and fallback behavior management.

**Tags**: Organizational system for guides and surveys with bulk operations, filtering capabilities, and naming conventions for campaign, feature, and team categorization.

## Advanced Features and Configuration

**Throttling**: Rate limiting controls to manage guide and survey frequency with configurable limits and time periods (day/week/month/session).

**Custom CSS**: Beta feature providing CSS class selectors for advanced styling customization (web SDK only).

**Proxy Support**: AWS CloudFront reverse proxy configuration with specific cache behaviors for `cdn.amplitude.com` static assets and `gs.amplitude.com` API requests.

**Testing and Preview**: Preview mode for condition verification, live testing with cohort targeting, and troubleshooting tools including "Reset User History" and "Ignore Throttle Limits."

## Permissions and Access Control

Three-tier permission system (Viewer, Member, Manager) that overrides base Amplitude user roles, providing granular access control for viewing, editing drafts, publishing, and running experiments within the Guides and Surveys module.

The platform integrates seamlessly with the broader Amplitude ecosystem while maintaining its own specialized analytics schema, user management system, and content delivery infrastructure, positioning it as a comprehensive solution for in-product user engagement and feedback collection.
