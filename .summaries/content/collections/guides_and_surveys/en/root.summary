Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user engagement platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to enhance user onboarding, collect feedback, and improve retention, activation, and engagement metrics. The platform enables product, growth, and product marketing teams to create contextual, interactive experiences directly within their applications.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of three primary components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** are interactive, multi-step experiences designed for user onboarding and feature adoption. They support five form factors: Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner, and Checklist. Guides utilize behavioral triggers, strike detection, and rate-limiting mechanisms to deliver contextual assistance. Available templates include tours for product exploration, announcements for feature releases, checklists for task completion, banners for broad messaging, and tooltips for contextual help.

**Surveys** focus on feedback collection through four unique block types: Rating (with Stars, NPS, Emoji, and Rating labels), Long answer, Short answer, and List blocks. Surveys support conditional logic for dynamic response branching and utilize a subset of guide form factors (modal, popover, pin). The platform provides comprehensive analytics through the Insights tab for aggregate metrics and the Responses tab for individual user data, with CSV export capabilities up to 10,000 responses.

**Resource Center** is a help widget that integrates with the SDK to provide search functionality, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. It features an Autopilot system that uses semantic search to automatically generate article recommendations by analyzing page content and surfacing relevant articles from content repositories.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Form Factors** define the visual presentation and interaction patterns: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual containers), Pin (persistent elements), Tooltip (hover-triggered information), Banner (full-width notifications), and Checklist (task-oriented interfaces).

**Lifecycle UUID** groups related events together for analytics tracking, while **Step ID** and **Step Index** properties track user progression through multi-step experiences. **Variant ID** enables A/B testing capabilities.

**Targeting and Triggering** encompasses user segmentation, rollout percentages, and various trigger types including element appearance/clicks, time delays, rage clicks, user confusion, and event tracking. The system supports CSS Selector and XPath targeting with URL matching patterns and regex support.

**Throttling** controls the rate and frequency of artifact appearance through configurable limits across different time periods (day/week/month/session), with separate settings for guides versus surveys.

## SDK Implementation and Platform Support

The platform provides comprehensive SDK support across multiple platforms:

**Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with Amplitude Browser SDK, third-party analytics providers like Segment, and Google Tag Manager. Key methods include `engagement.init()`, `engagement.boot()`, `engagement.forwardEvent()`, and various control methods for themes, localization, and programmatic guide/survey management.

**Android SDK** (`amplitude-engagement-android`) supports Jetpack Compose through `.amplitudeView` modifier and traditional Android views using `contentDescription`/`tag` properties. It includes `AmplitudeEngagement` class initialization, screen tracking, and theme management.

**iOS SDK** (`AmplitudeEngagementSwift`) integrates with iOS Swift SDK as a plugin, supporting Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods installation, with element targeting through `accessibilityIdentifier`.

**React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) provides deep linking support via `handleURL()` and plugin booting with user/device IDs.

## Analytics and Experimentation

The platform includes comprehensive analytics capabilities with specific event types: Survey Submitted, Survey Abandoned, Guide Completed, Guide Dismissed, Tooltip Marker Viewed, and Rage Closed events. Analytics properties include common elements like Lifecycle UUID, Step ID, Variant ID, and Survey Response data.

**Amplitude Experiment integration** enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, with variant configuration, exposure event handling, and insights dashboard analytics for performance tracking.

## Advanced Features and Customization

**Personalization** is achieved through the "Personalize with Variables" feature, which dynamically inserts client-side user properties into guide and survey text blocks with fallback value support.

**Localization** enables multi-language content delivery through SDK locale configuration, with support for XLIFF file translation workflows, AI localization with Claude, and fallback behavior configuration.

**Themes** provide comprehensive branding customization through a Theme Editor with Brand controls and Component editor sections, supporting accent colors, typography (Google fonts), form controls styling, widget dimensions, animations, and platform-specific themes.

**Custom CSS** styling is available as a beta feature for web SDK, providing CSS class selectors for targeting form factors and survey elements with `amplitude-engagement` CSS classes.

## Permission System and Management

The platform implements a three-tier permission system (Viewer, Member, Manager) that overrides base Amplitude user roles, providing granular access control for viewing, editing drafts, publishing, and running experiments. The system supports per-project role assignment through the Guides and Surveys > Permissions interface.

**Tags** enable organization and filtering of guides and surveys, with bulk operations support and integration into campaign, feature, and team-based workflows.

**Templates** provide reusable starting points for guides and surveys, with visibility management and integration into the Create Guide/Survey workflow.

## Testing and Deployment

**Preview mode** allows comprehensive testing of trigger, limit, and throttle conditions before launch, with troubleshooting capabilities and live testing using cohort targeting. The system provides condition status indicators and manual trigger capabilities.

**Proxy configuration** is supported through AWS CloudFront setup with specific cache behaviors for the `/sdk/*` path pattern, enabling enterprise deployment scenarios.

The platform integrates seamlessly with the broader Amplitude ecosystem, leveraging user segmentation, event tracking, and analytics capabilities while providing specialized tools for in-product user engagement and feedback collection.
