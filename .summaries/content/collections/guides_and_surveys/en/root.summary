Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user engagement platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to enhance user onboarding, collect feedback, and improve retention, activation, and engagement metrics. The platform enables product, growth, and product marketing teams to create contextual, non-intrusive messaging experiences directly within their applications.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of three primary components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** are interactive, multi-step experiences designed for user onboarding and feature exploration. They support six template types (Tour, Announcement, Checklists, Carousel, Banners, Tooltips) and utilize five form factors (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner, and Checklist) with advanced positioning, multi-step configurations, and interactive blocks including buttons, images, and videos.

**Surveys** focus on feedback collection through four unique block types (Rating, Long answer, Short answer, List) with conditional logic for dynamic response branching. They support specialized rating types including Stars, NPS, Emoji, and Rating labels, using a subset of guide form factors (modal, popover, pin).

**Resource Center** functions as an integrated help widget that provides search functionality, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. It connects with external documentation repositories through website scraping and supports semantic search via Autopilot for automatic article recommendations.

## Multi-Platform SDK Implementation

The platform supports comprehensive cross-platform deployment through dedicated SDKs:

- **Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with Amplitude Browser SDK, third-party analytics providers like Segment, and Google Tag Manager
- **iOS SDK** (`Amplitude-Engagement-Swift`) supports Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods installation with SwiftUI integration
- **Android SDK** (`amplitude-engagement-android`) provides Jetpack Compose support with `.amplitudeView` modifier
- **React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) offers cross-platform mobile deployment

Each SDK provides methods for initialization (`engagement.init()`, `engagement.boot()`), element targeting, screen tracking, theme management, and preview mode configuration with custom URL schemes.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Form Factors** define the visual presentation and positioning of guides and surveys, including Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual bubbles), Pin (anchored elements), Tooltip (hover information), Banner (persistent notifications), and Checklist (task-oriented interfaces).

**Targeting and Triggers** control when and to whom content appears, supporting element appearance/clicks, time delays, rage clicks, user confusion detection, event tracking, and sophisticated user segmentation with cohort targeting and page-specific URL matching patterns.

**Lifecycle Management** encompasses status states (draft, published, scheduled), priority levels (urgent, high, medium, low), display limits with cooldown periods, and throttling controls that manage artifact appearance frequency across different time periods (day/week/month/session).

**Analytics Integration** leverages Amplitude event tracking with specific events like Guide Viewed, Guide Completed, Guide Engaged, Survey Submitted, and Survey Abandoned, along with common properties including App Type, Lifecycle UUID, Step ID, and Variant ID for A/B testing.

## Advanced Features and Customization

**Experimentation** integrates with Amplitude Experiment to support A/B tests and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, with variant configuration, exposure event handling, and insights dashboard analytics for performance tracking.

**Personalization** includes dynamic content insertion through client-side user properties, localization support for multiple languages with XLIFF file workflows and AI-powered translation, and theme customization through a comprehensive Theme Editor with brand controls and component styling.

**Resource Center Capabilities** feature Autopilot's semantic search algorithm for automatic content recommendations, configurable recommendation sets with various action types (visit link, click element, run callback, open third-party chat, show guide/survey, open article, play video), and website scraper functionality for content repository integration.

## Permissions and Access Control

The platform implements a three-tier permission system (Viewer, Member, Manager) that overrides base Amplitude user roles, providing granular access control for viewing, editing drafts, publishing content, and running experiments within the Guides and Surveys module.

## Technical Integration Points

Key API endpoints and configuration methods include `engagement.forwardEvent()` for event-based triggers, `engagement.setThemeMode()` for theme management, `engagement.addCallback()` for custom button actions, `engagement.setRouter()` for single-page application navigation, and `engagement.updateLanguage()` for localization. The platform supports Content Security Policy (CSP) nonce configuration, proxy setup with custom serverUrl and cdnUrl, and server zone configuration for EU/US data residency requirements.

The system integrates deeply with the broader Amplitude ecosystem through shared user properties, event tracking, cohort targeting, and Microscope session replay integration, providing a unified approach to user engagement and analytics within the Amplitude platform.
