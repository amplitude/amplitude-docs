Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to improve user retention, activation, and engagement through targeted onboarding experiences and feedback collection. The platform enables product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams to deploy contextual guidance and gather user insights directly within their applications.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of three primary components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** provide interactive in-product guidance through five distinct form factors: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual bubbles), Pin (persistent elements), Tooltip (hover information), Banner (notification bars), and Checklist (task lists). These guides support multi-step experiences with advanced customization including z-index positioning, text animations with typewriter effects, and interactive blocks containing buttons, images, and videos.

**Surveys** enable targeted feedback collection through four specialized block types: Rating blocks (supporting Stars, NPS, Emoji, and Rating labels), Long answer blocks for detailed responses, Short answer blocks for brief input, and List blocks for multiple choice options. The survey system implements conditional logic for dynamic response paths and supports randomized ordering with pre-fill capabilities using user properties.

**Resource Center** functions as an intelligent help widget that integrates external documentation repositories, provides semantic search functionality, displays recommended content through Autopilot algorithms, and offers quick links with customizable call-to-action buttons. The Resource Center can scrape website content, manage article visibility through Draft/Published states, and deliver personalized landing pages based on user context.

## Multi-Platform SDK Implementation

The platform provides comprehensive SDK support across web and mobile platforms. The **Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with the Amplitude Browser SDK as a plugin, supports third-party analytics providers including Segment, and offers Google Tag Manager templates. Key methods include `engagement.init()` and `engagement.boot()` for initialization, `forwardEvent()` for event-based triggers, `setThemeMode()` for theme management, and `updateLanguage()` for localization.

**Mobile SDKs** are available for iOS, Android, and React Native platforms. The **iOS SDK** (`AmplitudeEngagementSwift`) requires iOS 15+ and Swift 5.9+, supporting Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods installation with `AmplitudeEngagement.boot()` methods and `accessibilityIdentifier` for element targeting. The **Android SDK** (`amplitude-engagement-android`) requires API Level 24+ and Kotlin 1.8.22, utilizing `AmplitudeEngagement` class initialization with `AmplitudeBootOptions` configuration. The **React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) provides deep linking support through `handleURL()` methods and plugin booting with user/device ID initialization.

## Advanced Targeting and Experimentation

The platform implements sophisticated targeting mechanisms through the Setup and Targeting system, supporting user segmentation via properties and cohorts, trigger conditions including element appearance/clicks, time delays, smart delay, rage click detection, and user confusion detection. Page targeting utilizes CSS selectors and XPath expressions with URL matching patterns, while priority levels (Urgent/High/Medium/Low) manage display precedence with tiebreaker logic for multiple eligible experiences.

**Amplitude Experiment integration** enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, with variant configuration, exposure event tracking, and insights dashboard analytics for performance measurement. The experimentation framework supports treatment vs control groups with configurable rollout percentages and Manager role permissions for experiment execution.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Lifecycle UUID** serves as the primary identifier for tracking user interactions across guide and survey experiences. **Step ID and Step Index** manage multi-step experience navigation and analytics tracking. **Variant ID** enables A/B testing identification within experimental frameworks.

**Form Factors** define the visual presentation modes: Modal (full overlay), Popover (contextual positioning), Pin (persistent placement), Tooltip (hover-triggered), Banner (notification style), and Checklist (task-oriented). **Blocks** represent content components within surveys, including Rating, Long answer, Short answer, and List types with conditional logic capabilities.

**Autopilot** refers to the Resource Center's semantic search algorithm that automatically generates content recommendations by scanning repository content and surfacing relevant articles based on user context and page location.

## Analytics and Event Tracking

The platform generates comprehensive analytics events tracked through Amplitude, including Guide Completed, Survey Submitted, and Tooltip Marker Viewed events. Common properties include Lifecycle UUID, Step ID, Step Index, and Variant ID for A/B testing identification. Debug Mode filtering enables development environment separation from production analytics.

Survey analysis features provide aggregate data through the Insights tab with type-specific insights including NPS scoring (promoters, detractors, passives), list breakdowns, and filtering capabilities. Time-based engagement charts integrate with Microscope for session replay analysis, while the Responses tab enables individual user response analysis with sorting and filtering options.

## Localization and Theming

**Localization support** enables multilingual content delivery through SDK locale initialization, Project settings language configuration, and translation workflows using both web interface and .xliff file methods. The system implements locale code language resolution with translation fallback behavior for Growth and Enterprise plan customers.

**Themes functionality** provides comprehensive branding customization through the Theme Editor, including Brand controls for accent colors and typography using Google fonts, Component editor for form controls styling, widget dimensions configuration for Modal, Popover, Tooltip, and Checklist form factors, and animation settings with CSS properties configuration.

## Permission Management and Deployment

The platform implements a five-tier permission system: No access, Viewer (read-only), Member (draft editing), Manager (publishing and experiments), and Administrator (full access). These permissions override base Amplitude user roles to provide granular access control within the Guides and Surveys module.

**Deployment infrastructure** supports proxy configuration through AWS CloudFront for domain blocking circumvention, utilizing dual origins (cdn.amplitude.com for static assets, gs.amplitude.com for API requests) with /sdk/ path prefix routing. Content Security Policy (CSP) directives ensure secure deployment, while Single Page Application (SPA) router configuration enables seamless integration with modern web frameworks.

The platform integrates deeply with the broader Amplitude ecosystem through event forwarding, cohort targeting, user property utilization, and Microscope session replay integration, providing a comprehensive solution for in-product user experience optimization and feedback collection.
