Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to improve user retention, activation, and engagement through targeted onboarding experiences and feedback collection. The platform enables product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams to deploy contextual guidance and gather user insights directly within their applications.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of three primary components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** provide interactive in-product guidance through five distinct form factors: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual bubbles), Pin (persistent elements), Tooltip (hover information), Banner (notification bars), and Checklist (task lists). These guides support multi-step navigation, advanced triggers, and various interactive blocks including buttons, images, and videos. Available templates include Tours for step-by-step onboarding, Announcements for feature releases, Checklists for task completion, Banners for notifications, and Tooltips for contextual help.

**Surveys** enable targeted feedback collection through four specialized block types: Rating (Stars, NPS, Emoji, Rating labels), Long answer, Short answer, and List blocks. Surveys support conditional logic for dynamic response paths and utilize a subset of guide form factors (modal, popover, pin). The platform provides comprehensive analytics through the Insights tab for aggregate metrics and the Responses tab for individual user data with CSV export capabilities.

**Resource Center** functions as an intelligent help widget that integrates search functionality, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. It features Autopilot, which uses semantic search algorithms to automatically generate content recommendations from external documentation repositories, serving as a smart fallback when manual recommendation sets aren't configured.

## SDK Implementation and Platform Support

The platform provides comprehensive SDK support across multiple platforms through dedicated packages:

- **Web SDK**: `@amplitude/engagement-browser` with integration support for Amplitude Browser SDK, third-party analytics providers, and Google Tag Manager
- **iOS SDK**: `Amplitude-Engagement-Swift` supporting Swift 5.9 and iOS 15+ with Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods installation
- **Android SDK**: `amplitude-engagement-android` requiring Android API Level 24+ and Kotlin 1.8.22
- **React Native SDK**: `@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native` with deep linking support

All SDKs share common initialization patterns using `AmplitudeEngagement` classes with `init()` and `boot()` methods, supporting user/device ID configuration, screen tracking, element targeting, and preview mode functionality.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Lifecycle UUID** serves as the primary identifier for tracking user interactions across guide and survey experiences. **Step ID** and **Step Index** provide granular tracking of multi-step experience progression. **Variant ID** enables A/B testing through Amplitude Experiment integration.

**Behavioral Triggers** include element appearance/clicks, time delays, smart delay, rage click detection, user confusion detection, and event tracking. **Strike Detection** and **Rate-limiting Mechanisms** prevent user experience fatigue through intelligent throttling.

**Form Factors** define the visual presentation layer, while **Blocks** represent the content and interaction elements within each experience. **Targeting** encompasses user segmentation through properties, cohorts, and page-specific rules with priority levels (Urgent/High/Medium/Low).

## Analytics and Experimentation Framework

The platform provides extensive analytics capabilities through Amplitude integration, tracking events such as Guide Engaged, Guide Step Completed, Survey Submitted, Survey Abandoned, and Tooltip Marker Viewed. The analytics framework filters Debug Mode events and supports Microscope integration for session replay analysis.

Amplitude Experiment integration enables sophisticated A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on both guides and surveys. The system tracks variant exposure events and provides comprehensive insights dashboard analytics with performance overview metrics and time-based analysis capabilities.

## Targeting and Personalization Engine

The targeting system supports both "All Users" and "Targeted Users" configurations with property and cohort filtering. Page targeting utilizes URL matching patterns, CSS selectors, and XPath expressions for precise element targeting. The platform implements priority-based display logic with tiebreaker mechanisms when multiple experiences are eligible.

Display limits and cooldown periods prevent user fatigue, while dismissable and snoozable settings provide user control. The visual selector tool simplifies element targeting for non-technical users.

## Localization and Content Management

The platform supports comprehensive localization through SDK locale initialization and Project settings configuration. Translation workflows accommodate both web interface editing and .xliff file methods for serving multilingual content. The system implements locale code language resolution with fallback behavior for unsupported languages.

Content management includes draft/published status workflows, scheduling capabilities, and version control. The Website scraper feature enables automatic content ingestion from external documentation sources with URL filtering and content selector overrides.

## Permission System and User Management

A three-tier permission system (Viewer, Member, Manager) overrides base Amplitude user roles to provide granular access control. Permissions govern viewing capabilities, draft editing rights, publishing authority, and experiment execution access within the Guides and Surveys module.

## Infrastructure and Deployment

The platform supports proxy configuration through AWS CloudFront for circumventing domain blocking while maintaining performance. The system utilizes dual origins (cdn.amplitude.com for static assets, gs.amplitude.com for API requests) with /sdk/ path prefix routing. Content Security Policy (CSP) nonce support ensures security compliance, while serverZone configuration (EU/US) enables data residency compliance.

Key API endpoints include the engagement SDK with serverUrl and cdnUrl configuration options, while command line functionality is primarily accessed through SDK methods like `engagement.gs.show()`, `engagement.gs.reset()`, and various configuration methods for theme management, callbacks, and localization.
