Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to improve user retention, activation, and engagement through targeted onboarding experiences and feedback collection. The platform enables product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams to deploy contextual guidance and gather user insights directly within their applications.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of three primary components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** provide interactive in-product guidance through five distinct form factors: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual bubbles), Pin (persistent elements), Tooltip (hover information), Banner (notification bars), and Checklist (task lists). These guides support multi-step navigation, conditional logic, and rich media content including images and videos.

**Surveys** enable targeted feedback collection using four specialized block types: Rating blocks (supporting Stars, NPS, Emoji, and custom Rating labels), Long answer blocks for detailed responses, Short answer blocks for brief input, and List blocks for multiple choice selections. Surveys implement conditional logic for dynamic response paths and support the same form factors as guides (excluding tooltip and banner).

**Resource Center** functions as an intelligent help widget that integrates external documentation repositories, provides semantic search capabilities, and delivers contextual content recommendations through its Autopilot feature, which automatically surfaces relevant articles based on page context.

## Technical Implementation and SDKs

The platform provides comprehensive SDK support across multiple platforms:

**Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with the Amplitude Browser SDK as a plugin, supports third-party analytics providers including Segment, and offers Google Tag Manager templates. Key methods include `engagement.init()`, `engagement.boot()`, `forwardEvent()` for event-based triggers, `setThemeMode()` for theme management, and `updateLanguage()` for localization.

**Mobile SDKs** are available for iOS (AmplitudeEngagement with Swift Package Manager/CocoaPods), Android (amplitude-engagement-android with gradle dependencies), and React Native (@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native). Mobile implementations support deep linking through custom URL schemes and provide screen tracking capabilities for precise targeting.

**API Integration** utilizes dual-origin architecture with cdn.amplitude.com for static assets and gs.amplitude.com for API requests, supporting proxy configurations through AWS CloudFront for domain blocking circumvention.

## Targeting and Personalization System

The platform implements sophisticated targeting mechanisms that operate at multiple levels:

**User Targeting** supports both broad deployment (All Users) and precise segmentation through user properties, cohorts, and behavioral criteria. The system processes targeting rules with priority-based logic and tiebreaker mechanisms when multiple experiences are eligible.

**Trigger Conditions** include element appearance/clicks (using CSS selectors and XPath expressions), time-based delays with smart delay algorithms, rage click detection, user confusion detection, and custom event tracking integration.

**Page Targeting** employs URL matching patterns, query parameter evaluation, and dynamic page rule configuration to ensure contextual relevance.

## Analytics and Experimentation Framework

Amplitude's analytics integration provides comprehensive event tracking through standardized event properties:

**Core Event Properties** include Lifecycle UUID for session tracking, Step ID and Step Index for navigation analysis, and Variant ID for A/B testing identification.

**Event Types** encompass Guide Completed, Survey Submitted, Tooltip Marker Viewed, and other interaction-specific events that feed into Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem.

**Experimentation** integrates with Amplitude Experiment to support A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on both guides and surveys, with variant configuration, exposure event handling, and performance analytics through the Insights dashboard.

## Content Management and Localization

The platform provides robust content management capabilities:

**Themes System** offers comprehensive branding customization through the Theme Editor, including Brand controls for colors and typography, Component editor for form controls and widget dimensions, and platform-specific theme deployment.

**Localization Support** enables multilingual content delivery through SDK locale initialization, Project settings language configuration, and translation workflows using both web interface and .xliff file methods with automatic fallback behavior.

**Content Lifecycle** manages experiences through Draft, Published, and Scheduled states with role-based permissions across five access levels: No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, and Administrator.

## Resource Center and Content Intelligence

The Resource Center represents an advanced content discovery system:

**Content Sources** support documentation repositories and video libraries with configurable sync options, Website scraper functionality for automatic content extraction, and CSV/XML sitemap integration.

**Recommendation Engine** employs semantic search algorithms through Autopilot to automatically generate content recommendations, with manual recommendation sets for curated experiences and priority-based display logic.

**Integration Capabilities** include third-party chat module support, callback functions for custom actions, and comprehensive action types (visit link, click element, run callback, open article, play video).

## Development and Testing Workflow

The platform provides comprehensive development support:

**Preview Mode** enables condition verification (trigger, limit, throttle) with visual status indicators, user history reset capabilities, and manual event triggering for testing scenarios.

**Testing Infrastructure** supports cohort-based live testing, condition troubleshooting with detailed status reporting, and integration with session replay through Microscope for behavioral analysis.

**Deployment Options** include Content Security Policy (CSP) configuration, Single Page Application (SPA) router integration, and serverZone configuration for EU/US compliance requirements.

The platform integrates seamlessly into the broader Amplitude ecosystem, leveraging existing user data, behavioral analytics, and experimentation infrastructure while providing specialized tools for in-product user experience optimization and feedback collection.
