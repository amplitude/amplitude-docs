# Amplitude Guides and Surveys

## Product Overview

Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product messaging and feedback collection platform designed to improve user experience, facilitate product learning, and gather user feedback. The product serves as an alternative to traditional popup components, helping product teams, growth teams, and marketing teams to improve key metrics like retention, activation, and engagement.

The platform consists of two main components:

1. **Guides**: In-product messages that help users complete tasks or explore features using behavioral triggers and rate-limiting mechanisms to avoid disruption.

2. **Surveys**: Targeted feedback collection tools that allow teams to gather specific insights from users at strategic points in their journey.

## Key Features and Components

### Guides

Guides offer five form factors for in-product messaging:

1. **Modal**: Full-screen overlays for important announcements
2. **Popover**: Contextual messages that appear near specific UI elements
3. **Pin**: Small indicators that expand when clicked
4. **Tooltip**: Subtle hints that provide contextual information
5. **Banner**: Persistent messages that appear at the top or bottom of the screen

These form factors can be implemented using five template types:

1. **Tour**: Step-by-step instructions for product exploration
2. **Announcement**: Important updates or new feature notifications
3. **Checklist**: Task-oriented guides for completing multi-step processes
4. **Banner**: Persistent notifications
5. **Tooltip**: Contextual help for specific UI elements

### Surveys

Surveys provide three template options:

1. **NPS (Net Promoter Score)**: Measures customer satisfaction and loyalty
2. **User Feedback**: Customizable questions for gathering specific insights
3. **Rating**: Collects initial reactions to product experiences

Survey blocks include various rating types:
- Stars
- Rating labels
- Emoji
- NPS (Net Promoter Score)

Surveys support conditional logic for creating dynamic response paths based on user input.

### Analytics and Analysis

Both guides and surveys include robust analytics capabilities:

- **Overview Tab**: Provides analytics features including filter cards, performance metrics, and interaction tracking
- **Insights Tab**: For aggregate survey data analysis, including type-specific insights for NPS and List surveys
- **Responses Tab**: For viewing individual user feedback with sorting and filtering capabilities
- **Microscope Integration**: For deeper user behavior analysis

### Experimentation

The platform integrates with Amplitude Experiment to enable:
- A/B testing
- Multi-armed Bandit experiments
- Variant configuration
- Performance analysis through the Insights dashboard

### Customization

- **Themes**: Control appearance elements like colors, typography, animations, and component styles
- **Localization**: Support for multiple languages without creating duplicate content
- **Properties**: Configuration and metadata management

## Product Relationships and Architecture

Guides and Surveys is part of the broader Amplitude product ecosystem, integrating with:

1. **Amplitude Analytics**: For tracking user interactions and measuring guide/survey performance
2. **Amplitude Experiment**: For testing different guide/survey variants
3. **Third-party analytics providers**: Through SDK integration options

The implementation architecture consists of:

1. **Guides and Surveys SDK**: Client-side component that renders guides and surveys
2. **Amplitude Backend**: Manages targeting, analytics, and content delivery
3. **Optional Proxy Configuration**: For environments where domain blocking is a concern

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Guide-Related Terms

- **Form Factors**: The visual presentation styles of guides (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner)
- **Templates**: Pre-designed guide structures (Tour, Announcement, Checklist, Banner, Tooltip)
- **Trigger Conditions**: Rules that determine when and where guides appear
- **Display Limits**: Controls how often guides can be shown to users
- **Smart Delay**: Feature that prevents guides from appearing immediately upon page load
- **Tiebreaker Rules**: Logic that determines which guide to show when multiple are eligible

### Survey-Related Terms

- **NPS (Net Promoter Score)**: A metric used to measure customer loyalty and satisfaction
- **Promoters/Passives/Detractors**: Categories of respondents in NPS surveys
- **Conditional Logic**: Rules that change survey flow based on user responses
- **Survey Blocks**: Components used to build surveys (Rating, Text, etc.)

### Analytics Terms

- **Lifecycle UUID**: Unique identifier for a guide or survey instance
- **Viewed Event**: Triggered when a user sees a guide or survey
- **Dismissed Event**: Triggered when a user closes a guide or survey without completing it
- **Completed Event**: Triggered when a user finishes all steps of a guide
- **Survey Submitted**: Triggered when a user submits a survey
- **Survey Abandoned**: Triggered when a user leaves a survey without completing it
- **Tooltip Marker**: Visual indicator for tooltip-style guides
- **Variant ID**: Identifier for different versions in experiments

## Implementation and Integration

### SDK Installation Options

The Guides and Surveys SDK can be implemented through:

1. **Amplitude Browser SDK**: 
   ```javascript
   import * as amplitude from '@amplitude/analytics-browser';
   import * as engagement from '@amplitude/engagement-browser';
   
   amplitude.init('API_KEY');
   engagement.boot({
     client: amplitude,
     // additional configuration
   });
   ```

2. **Third-party analytics providers**:
   ```javascript
   import * as engagement from '@amplitude/engagement-browser';
   
   engagement.boot({
     forwardEvent: (event) => {
       // Send to your analytics provider
     }
   });
   ```

3. **Google Tag Manager**

### Key SDK Methods

- `boot()`: Initializes the SDK
- `setThemeMode()`: Sets light or dark mode
- `addCallback()`: Registers callback functions for guide/survey events
- `reset()`: Clears user history
- `show()`: Manually displays a specific guide
- `list()`: Returns available guides

### Proxy Configuration

For environments with domain blocking concerns, the documentation provides instructions for setting up an AWS CloudFront distribution to reverse proxy both static assets and API traffic, with configuration for:

- `cdn.amplitude.com` for static assets
- `gs.amplitude.com` for API traffic

## User Permissions and Access Control

Guides and Surveys has its own permission system that can override a user's base Amplitude role, with five access levels:

1. **No Access**: Cannot view or edit guides and surveys
2. **Viewer**: Can view published guides and surveys
3. **Member**: Can create and edit drafts, but cannot publish
4. **Manager**: Can create, edit, and publish guides and surveys
5. **Administrator**: Full access, including managing user permissions

## Advanced Features

### Localization

Supports serving content in multiple languages without creating duplicates, requiring:
- SDK implementation updates to specify user locale
- Project settings configuration to define supported languages
- Translation fallback behaviors for missing translations

### Experimentation

Supports A/B testing and Multi-armed Bandit experiments with:
- Variant configuration
- Exposure event tracking
- Performance analysis through the Insights dashboard

### Testing

Provides a Preview mode for testing functionality before launch, including:
- Condition status indicators (trigger, limit, throttle)
- Reset User History option
- Ignore Throttle Limits option
- Manual event triggering
- Live testing with targeted cohorts
