Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user engagement platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to enhance user onboarding, collect feedback, and improve retention, activation, and engagement metrics. The platform enables product, growth, and product marketing teams to create contextual, non-intrusive messaging experiences directly within their applications.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of three primary components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** are interactive, multi-step experiences designed for user onboarding and feature exploration. They support six template types (Tour, Announcement, Checklists, Carousel, Banners, Tooltips) and utilize five form factors (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner, and Checklist) with advanced positioning, multi-step configurations, and interactive blocks including buttons, images, and videos.

**Surveys** focus on feedback collection through four specialized block types (Rating, Long answer, Short answer, List) with conditional logic for dynamic response branching. Survey templates include NPS, User feedback, Rating, and mobile Carousel formats, supporting various rating types including Stars, NPS, Emoji, and Rating labels.

**Resource Center** provides a searchable widget that integrates external documentation repositories and videos, featuring semantic search capabilities, recommendation sets, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. The Autopilot feature automatically generates article recommendations using semantic search to analyze page content.

## Multi-Platform SDK Implementation

The platform supports comprehensive cross-platform deployment through dedicated SDKs:

**Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with Amplitude Browser SDK, third-party analytics providers like Segment, and Google Tag Manager. Key methods include `engagement.init()`, `engagement.boot()`, `engagement.forwardEvent()`, `engagement.setThemeMode()`, and `engagement.gs.show()`.

**iOS SDK** (`Amplitude-Engagement-Swift`) supports Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods installation, utilizing `AmplitudeEngagement` class with `accessibilityIdentifier` and `amplitudeView` modifier for element targeting, plus screen tracking via `amplitudeEngagement.screen()`.

**Android SDK** (`amplitude-engagement-android`) provides Jetpack Compose support through `.amplitudeView` modifier and traditional Android views using `contentDescription`/`tag` selectors, with `AmplitudeEngagement` class initialization and `handlePreviewLinkIntent` for preview mode.

**React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) integrates with `@amplitude/analytics-react-native`, featuring `getPlugin()` function, `handleURL()` deep linking, and plugin booting with user/device ID configuration.

## Advanced Targeting and Personalization

The platform employs sophisticated targeting mechanisms including user segmentation (All Users vs Targeted Users with rollout percentages and bucketing units), behavioral triggers (element appearance/clicks, time delays, smart delay, rage click, user confusion, event tracking), and page targeting rules using CSS Selector and XPath targeting.

**Personalization** is achieved through the "Personalize with Variables" feature, which dynamically inserts client-side user properties into guide and survey text blocks with fallback value support. The system supports comprehensive localization through SDK locale configuration, XLIFF file translation workflows, AI localization with Claude, and fallback behavior configuration.

## Analytics and Experimentation

All interactions generate detailed analytics events prefixed with `[Guides-Surveys]` in Amplitude, including common properties (App Type, Lifecycle UUID, Step ID, Variant ID) and specific events (Guide Viewed, Guide Completed, Survey Submitted, Survey Abandoned, Resource Center interactions).

**Amplitude Experiment integration** enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, with variant configuration, exposure event handling, and insights dashboard analytics for treatment vs control performance tracking.

## Enterprise Features and Management

The platform includes enterprise-grade features such as **throttling controls** that manage artifact appearance frequency through configurable limits and time periods (day/week/month/session), **custom CSS styling** for web SDK with CSS class selectors targeting form factors and survey elements, and **proxy support** through AWS CloudFront configuration for unified distributions.

**Role-based permissions** provide five access levels (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) with granular control over viewing, editing, publishing, and experiment execution capabilities. The **themes system** enables comprehensive branding customization including colors, typography, form controls, widget dimensions, and animations through a Theme Editor interface.

**Content management** features include template creation for reusable starting points, tag-based organization with bulk operations, and comprehensive testing capabilities through preview mode with condition verification and live testing using cohort targeting.

The platform integrates seamlessly with the broader Amplitude ecosystem, leveraging user segments, cohorts, and analytics data while providing dedicated insights dashboards for aggregate metrics, individual response analysis, and time-based engagement tracking with Microscope integration for session replay analysis.
