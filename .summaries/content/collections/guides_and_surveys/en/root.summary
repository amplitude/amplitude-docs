Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to improve user retention, activation, and engagement through targeted onboarding experiences and feedback collection. The platform enables product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams to deploy contextual guidance and gather user insights directly within their applications.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of three primary components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** provide interactive in-product guidance through five distinct form factors: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual bubbles), Pin (persistent elements), Tooltip (hover information), Banner (notification bars), and Checklist (task lists). These guides support multi-step experiences with advanced customization including z-index positioning, text animations with typewriter effects, and interactive blocks containing buttons, images, and videos.

**Surveys** enable targeted feedback collection using four specialized block types: Rating blocks (supporting Stars, NPS, Emoji, and custom Rating labels), Long answer blocks for detailed responses, Short answer blocks for brief input, and List blocks for multiple choice options. The survey system implements conditional logic for dynamic response paths and supports pre-filling with user properties.

**Resource Center** functions as an intelligent help widget that integrates external documentation repositories, provides semantic search capabilities, displays recommended content through Autopilot automation, and offers quick links with customizable call-to-action buttons. The Resource Center can scrape website content, manage article visibility through draft/published states, and serve personalized landing pages.

## Multi-Platform SDK Implementation

The platform provides native SDKs across multiple platforms with consistent initialization patterns:

**Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with the Amplitude Browser SDK through `engagement.init()` and `engagement.boot()` methods, supporting third-party analytics providers like Segment and Google Tag Manager integration. Key methods include `engagement.gs.show()`, `engagement.gs.reset()`, and `engagement.forwardEvent()` for programmatic control.

**iOS SDK** (`AmplitudeEngagement`) supports Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods installation, utilizing `accessibilityIdentifier` for element targeting and `amplitudeView` for pin/tooltip guides. The SDK provides `ThemeMode` options (LIGHT/DARK/SYSTEM) and preview mode configuration through custom URL schemes.

**Android SDK** (`amplitude-engagement-android`) requires Android API Level 24+ and Kotlin 1.8.22+, implementing `AmplitudeEngagement` class with `AmplitudeBootOptions` and `AmplitudeEndUser` configuration. Preview mode setup involves AndroidManifest.xml intent filters and `handlePreviewLinkIntent` methods.

**React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) provides deep linking support via `handleURL()` method and plugin booting with user/device ID initialization through `getPlugin()` and `boot()` methods.

## Advanced Targeting and Experimentation

The platform implements sophisticated targeting mechanisms through behavioral triggers including element appearance/clicks, time delays, smart delay, rage click detection, user confusion detection, and event tracking. Page targeting supports URL matching patterns with CSS selector and XPath expressions, while user targeting enables property and cohort filtering with "All Users" vs "Targeted Users" segmentation.

**Amplitude Experiment Integration** enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys through variant configuration, experiment exposure events, and performance analytics. The system tracks variant exposure, completion rates, and provides insights dashboard analytics with time-based analysis capabilities.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Lifecycle UUID** serves as the primary identifier for tracking user interactions across guide and survey experiences. **Step ID** and **Step Index** provide granular tracking of multi-step experiences, while **Variant ID** enables A/B testing functionality.

**Strike Detection** and **Rate-Limiting Mechanisms** prevent user experience fatigue by controlling guide frequency and display patterns. **Rage Closes** track user frustration through rapid dismissal behavior, while **Smart Delay** intelligently times guide presentation based on user behavior patterns.

**Autopilot** represents the semantic search algorithm that automatically generates content recommendations for Resource Center by analyzing page context and repository content. **Recommendation Sets** are manually curated collections of articles and resources that can be targeted to specific user segments.

## Analytics and Performance Tracking

The platform generates comprehensive analytics events tracked through Amplitude, including generic events (Viewed/Dismissed/Completed), guide-specific events (Guide Engaged, Guide Step Completed), and survey-specific events (Survey Submitted, Survey Abandoned). The analytics system supports Debug Mode filtering and provides detailed event properties schema for user interaction tracking.

Performance monitoring includes views/completions metrics over time, rage close percentages, real-time interaction feeds with Microscope integration for session replays, and time-based engagement charts with rolling window date offset capabilities.

## Enterprise Features and Localization

**Localization Support** (available on Growth and Enterprise plans) enables multilingual content delivery through SDK locale initialization, Project settings language configuration, and translation workflows using both web interface and .xliff file methods. The system implements locale code language resolution with translation fallback behavior.

**Proxy Configuration** supports AWS CloudFront as a reverse proxy with dual origins (cdn.amplitude.com for static assets, gs.amplitude.com for API requests) to circumvent domain blocking while maintaining performance through CachingOptimized policies.

## Permission System and User Management

The platform implements a three-tier permission system (Viewer/Member/Manager) that overrides base Amplitude user roles, providing granular access control for viewing, editing drafts, publishing, and running experiments. The permission system operates at the project level with specific capabilities for draft vs published content access and experiment execution permissions managed through the Guides and Surveys > Permissions interface.
