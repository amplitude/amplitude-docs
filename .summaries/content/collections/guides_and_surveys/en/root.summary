Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to improve user retention, activation, and engagement through targeted onboarding experiences and feedback collection. The platform enables product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams to deploy contextual guidance and gather user insights directly within their applications.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of three primary components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** provide interactive in-product guidance through five distinct form factors: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual bubbles), Pin (persistent elements), Tooltip (hover information), Banner (notification bars), and Checklist (task lists). These guides support multi-step experiences with advanced customization including z-index positioning, text animations with typewriter effects, and interactive blocks containing buttons, images, and videos.

**Surveys** enable targeted feedback collection using four specialized block types: Rating blocks (supporting Stars, NPS, Emoji, and custom Rating labels), Long answer blocks for detailed responses, Short answer blocks for brief input, and List blocks for multiple choice options. The survey system implements conditional logic for dynamic response paths and supports randomization and pre-filling capabilities.

**Resource Center** functions as an intelligent help widget that integrates external documentation repositories and provides contextual assistance through search functionality, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. The Resource Center features Autopilot, which uses semantic search algorithms to automatically surface relevant articles based on page context.

## Platform Integration and SDK Architecture

The platform operates through dedicated SDKs across multiple platforms, each providing consistent functionality while adapting to platform-specific requirements:

The **Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with the Amplitude Browser SDK as a plugin, supporting third-party analytics providers like Segment and Google Tag Manager. Key methods include `engagement.init()` and `engagement.boot()` for initialization, `forwardEvent()` for event-based triggers, and `setThemeMode()` for theme management.

The **iOS SDK** (`AmplitudeEngagementSwift`) requires iOS 15+ and Swift 5.9+, utilizing Swift Package Manager or CocoaPods for installation. It provides `amplitudeEngagement.boot()` for user/device ID configuration, `amplitudeView` SwiftUI modifier for screen tracking, and `accessibilityIdentifier` for element targeting.

The **Android SDK** (`amplitude-engagement-android`) supports Android API Level 24+ with Kotlin 1.8.22, using the `AmplitudeEngagement` class for initialization and providing screen tracking capabilities for targeting rules.

The **React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) includes deep linking support through `handleURL()` and integrates with async storage for persistence.

## Targeting and Behavioral Systems

The platform implements sophisticated targeting mechanisms that operate at multiple levels. User targeting supports both broad "All Users" deployment and granular "Targeted Users" configuration using property filters and cohort segmentation. Page targeting utilizes URL matching patterns, CSS selectors, and XPath expressions to ensure content appears in appropriate contexts.

Trigger conditions include element appearance/clicks, time delays, smart delay algorithms, rage click detection, user confusion detection, and custom event tracking. The system implements priority levels (Urgent/High/Medium/Low) with tiebreaker logic when multiple experiences are eligible, along with display limits and cooldown periods to prevent user fatigue.

## Analytics and Experimentation Framework

Comprehensive analytics tracking utilizes Amplitude events with standardized properties including Lifecycle UUID for session tracking, Step ID and Step Index for navigation analysis, and Variant ID for A/B testing. Key events include Guide Engaged/Completed/Dismissed, Survey Submitted/Abandoned/Completed, and Tooltip Marker Viewed, with rage close detection for user experience optimization.

The platform integrates with Amplitude Experiment to support A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on both guides and surveys. Experiment management includes variant configuration, exposure event handling, and performance analytics through the Insights dashboard.

## Content Management and Localization

The Resource Center's content management system supports multiple source types including documentation repositories and video content, with Website scraper functionality for automatic content extraction using URL lists or CSV/XML sitemaps. Content filtering utilizes URL path inclusion/exclusion rules and CSS selector overrides for precise targeting.

Localization support operates through SDK locale initialization and Project settings configuration, supporting translation workflows via web interface and .xliff file methods. The system implements locale code resolution with fallback behavior for unsupported languages.

## Customization and Theming

The Themes system provides comprehensive branding control through a Theme Editor with Brand controls and Component editor sections. Customization options include accent colors, Google Fonts typography, form control styling, widget dimensions for each form factor, CSS property configuration, and animation settings. Themes can be published separately for web and mobile platforms to maintain consistent brand identity across touchpoints.

## Permission and Access Control

The platform implements a three-tier permission system (Viewer, Member, Manager) that overrides base Amplitude user roles, providing granular access control for viewing, editing drafts, publishing content, and running experiments. Permission management operates through the Guides and Surveys > Permissions interface with per-project role assignment capabilities.

## Technical Infrastructure

The platform supports proxy configuration through AWS CloudFront for circumventing domain blocking, utilizing dual origins (cdn.amplitude.com for static assets, gs.amplitude.com for API requests with /sdk/ prefix). Content Security Policy directives ensure secure deployment, while Single Page Application router configuration maintains functionality across navigation events.

Preview mode enables comprehensive testing of trigger, limit, and throttle conditions before launch, with troubleshooting capabilities including Reset User History, Ignore Throttle Limits, and manual event triggering for validation workflows.
