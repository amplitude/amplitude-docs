Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user engagement platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to enhance user onboarding, collect feedback, and improve retention, activation, and engagement metrics. The platform enables product, growth, and product marketing teams to create contextual, non-intrusive messaging experiences directly within their applications.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of three primary components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** are interactive, multi-step experiences designed for user onboarding and feature exploration. They support six template types: Tour (multi-step walkthroughs), Announcement (single-step notifications), Checklists (task completion tracking), Carousel (swipeable content sequences), Banners (persistent messaging), and Tooltips (contextual help). Guides utilize behavioral triggers, strike detection, and rate-limiting mechanisms to ensure appropriate timing and frequency.

**Surveys** focus on feedback collection through four unique block types: Rating (Stars, NPS, Emoji, Rating labels), Long answer, Short answer, and List blocks. Surveys support conditional logic for dynamic response branching and can be deployed using modal, popover, and pin form factors. The platform provides comprehensive analytics including NPS breakdowns, response aggregation, and individual user response tracking with CSV export capabilities up to 10,000 responses.

**Resource Center** functions as an intelligent help widget that integrates external documentation repositories and provides search functionality, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. It features an Autopilot system that uses semantic search algorithms to automatically generate article recommendations by analyzing page content, serving as a smart fallback when dedicated recommendation sets aren't configured.

## Form Factors and Customization

The platform supports five primary form factors that can be customized extensively: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual containers), Pin (targeted page elements), Tooltip (contextual help), Banner (persistent messaging), and Checklist (task tracking). Each form factor supports advanced customization including position settings, layout options, z-index controls, text animation (including typewriter effects), and interactive blocks such as buttons, images, and videos.

Content blocks support various media types including YouTube, Vimeo, Loom, Vidyard, and MP4 videos. Button actions include visit link, click element, show guide/survey, callback functions, and app store rating requests. The platform provides extensive theming capabilities through a Theme Editor with Brand controls and Component editor sections, allowing customization of colors, typography, form controls, cards, widget dimensions, and animations.

## SDK Implementation and Platform Support

Amplitude Guides and Surveys provides comprehensive SDK support across multiple platforms:

**Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with Amplitude Browser SDK 2.0, third-party analytics providers like Segment, and Google Tag Manager. Key methods include `engagement.init()`, `engagement.boot()`, `engagement.gs.show()`, and `engagement.gs.reset()`. The SDK supports Content Security Policy (CSP) nonce, single-page application routing with `setRouter()`, custom actions via `addCallback()`, and desktop app previewing through `_startNudgeDebug()`.

**iOS SDK** (Amplitude-Engagement-Swift) supports Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods installation, requiring Swift 5.9 and iOS 15+. Implementation uses `AmplitudeEngagement` class with `AmplitudeBootOptions`, screen tracking via `amplitudeEngagement.screen()`, and element targeting through `accessibilityIdentifier` and `amplitudeView` modifier.

**Android SDK** (`amplitude-engagement-android`) requires Android API Level 24+ and Kotlin 1.8.22+. It supports Jetpack Compose through `.amplitudeView` modifier and traditional views using `contentDescription` and `tag` selectors. The SDK uses `AmplitudeEngagement` class with `AmplitudeBootOptions` and `AmplitudeEndUser` configuration.

**React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) integrates with `@amplitude/analytics-react-native` and supports deep linking configuration through `handleURL()` method and URL scheme setup.

## Targeting and Personalization

The platform provides sophisticated targeting capabilities including user segmentation (All Users vs Targeted Users with cohorts), rollout percentages with bucketing units, and comprehensive trigger mechanisms. Triggers include element appearance/clicks (using CSS Selector and XPath), time delays, smart delay, rage click detection, user confusion detection, and event tracking integration.

Page targeting supports URL matching patterns and query parameters, while session properties can be set via `setSessionProperty()`. The platform includes a Personalize with Variables feature that dynamically inserts client-side user properties into guide and survey text blocks with fallback value support.

Priority levels (Urgent, High, Medium, Low) control display precedence, with tiebreaker logic for active state management. Display limits and cooldown periods prevent over-engagement, while localization support enables multi-language content delivery through SDK locale configuration, XLIFF file workflows, and AI-powered translation using Claude.

## Analytics and Experimentation

Comprehensive analytics tracking is provided through Amplitude integration with events prefixed `[Guides-Surveys]`. Common event properties include App Type (ios, android, react native, web), Lifecycle UUID, Step ID, Variant ID, and Source.type (nudge, trigger, sdk, share_link). Specific events track Guide Viewed/Completed/Dismissed, Survey Submitted/Abandoned/Response, and Resource Center interactions.

The platform integrates with Amplitude Experiment for A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys. Experiment management includes variant configuration, exposure event handling, and insights dashboard analytics with treatment vs control tracking and time-based engagement analysis.

Survey analysis features include an Insights tab for aggregate metrics and trends with NPS-specific breakdowns, and a Responses tab for individual user response data. Microscope integration provides session replay capabilities for deeper user behavior analysis.

## Content Management and Workflow

The platform includes a comprehensive content management system with template functionality for creating reusable starting points. Templates support visibility management with blue banner indicators and integrate with the Create Guide/Survey menu workflow. A tagging system enables organization through individual or bulk tag operations with filtering capabilities.

Testing capabilities include preview mode for verifying trigger, limit, and throttle conditions before launch, with troubleshooting tools like Reset User History, Ignore Throttle Limits, and manual event triggering. Live testing uses cohort targeting for real-world validation.

## Permission System and Enterprise Features

A five-tier permission system (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) provides granular access control that overrides base Amplitude user roles. Permissions control viewing, editing drafts, publishing, and running experiments within the Guides and Surveys module.

Enterprise features include throttling configuration for controlling artifact appearance frequency through configurable limits and time periods (day/week/month/session), with separate settings for guides versus surveys. Custom CSS styling support (web SDK only, beta) provides advanced customization through CSS class selectors for targeting form factors and survey elements.

The platform supports proxy configuration through AWS CloudFront for unified distribution with specific cache behaviors, and includes localization features available on Growth and Enterprise plans with support for multiple languages, fallback behavior configuration, and translation workflows.
