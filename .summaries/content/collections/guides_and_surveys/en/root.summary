Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user engagement platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to enhance user onboarding, collect feedback, and improve retention, activation, and engagement metrics. The platform enables product, growth, and product marketing teams to create contextual, non-intrusive messaging experiences directly within their applications.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of three primary components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** are interactive, multi-step experiences designed for user onboarding and feature exploration. They support six form factors (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner, Checklist) and utilize behavioral triggers, strike detection, and rate-limiting mechanisms. Guides can be created using templates including Tour, Announcement, Checklists, Carousel, Banners, and Tooltips, each optimized for specific use cases from step-by-step onboarding to contextual help.

**Surveys** focus on feedback collection and user sentiment analysis, supporting four unique block types (Rating, Long answer, Short answer, List) with conditional logic for dynamic response branching. Survey templates include NPS, User feedback, Rating, Carousel, Banner Survey, and Tooltip Survey configurations, with specialized analytics for NPS scoring and response aggregation.

**Resource Center** functions as an intelligent help widget that integrates external documentation repositories and provides search functionality, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. It features an Autopilot system that uses semantic search algorithms to automatically surface relevant articles based on page content analysis.

## SDK Integration and Multi-Platform Support

The platform provides comprehensive SDK support across multiple platforms:

- **Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with Amplitude Browser SDK 2.0, third-party analytics providers like Segment, and Google Tag Manager
- **iOS SDK** (`Amplitude-Engagement-Swift`) supports Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods installation with iOS 15+ requirements
- **Android SDK** (`amplitude-engagement-android`) supports Jetpack Compose and traditional Android views with API Level 24+ requirements  
- **React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) provides cross-platform mobile support with deep linking capabilities

## Key Technical Features and APIs

**Targeting and Personalization**: The platform offers sophisticated targeting through user segmentation, behavioral triggers (element appearance/clicks, time delays, rage clicks, user confusion, event tracking), session properties via `setSessionProperty()`, and page targeting with URL matching patterns and regex support.

**Analytics Integration**: Complete event schema integration with Amplitude analytics includes common event properties (App Type, Lifecycle UUID, Step ID, Variant ID), guide-specific events (Guide Viewed, Guide Completed, Guide Engaged), survey events (Survey Submitted, Survey Abandoned), and Resource Center interaction tracking.

**Experimentation**: Native integration with Amplitude Experiment enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, with variant configuration, exposure event handling, and performance analytics through the insights dashboard.

**Localization**: Multi-language support includes SDK locale initialization, project-level language configuration, fallback behavior settings, and three translation methods: web interface, AI localization with Claude, and XLIFF file upload workflows.

## Advanced Configuration and Management

**Throttling and Rate Limiting**: Global and granular throttling controls include limit/period settings, time delays between sequential guides, and advanced tag-based throttling for different content categories (campaigns, features, teams).

**Theming and Customization**: The Theme Editor provides comprehensive branding control over colors, typography (Google Fonts integration), form controls, widget dimensions, animations, and platform-specific styling. Custom CSS support is available for web SDK implementations with specific class selectors for targeting form factors and survey elements.

**Content Management**: Template system enables reusable starting points for guides and surveys, with visibility management, bulk operations, and tag-based organization. Content can be managed through draft/published/scheduled states with rollout percentage controls.

**Testing and Preview**: Preview mode allows condition verification (trigger, limit, throttle) before launch, with troubleshooting capabilities including Reset User History, Ignore Throttle Limits, and manual event triggering for comprehensive testing workflows.

The platform integrates seamlessly into existing product ecosystems through proxy configurations (AWS CloudFront support), Content Security Policy compliance, and extensive callback systems for custom business logic integration.
