Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to improve user retention, activation, and engagement through targeted onboarding experiences and feedback collection. The platform enables product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams to create non-intrusive user guidance and collect valuable user insights directly within their applications.

## Core Product Components

The platform consists of three primary modules that work together to create a complete user engagement ecosystem:

**Guides** provide interactive user guidance through five distinct templates: Tours (step-by-step product exploration), Announcements (feature highlights and updates), Checklists (task-oriented workflows), Banners (persistent messaging), and Tooltips (contextual help). These guides utilize sophisticated behavioral triggers including element appearance detection, time-based delays, rage click detection, and user confusion signals.

**Surveys** focus on feedback collection through specialized templates including NPS (Net Promoter Score), User Feedback, and Rating surveys. The survey system features four unique rating block types (Stars, Labels, Emoji, NPS variants) with conditional logic capabilities for dynamic response branching based on user inputs.

**Resource Center** functions as an intelligent help widget that integrates external documentation repositories, providing users with contextual assistance through semantic search, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. The Resource Center includes an Autopilot feature that automatically surfaces relevant content based on user location and behavior.

## Form Factors and Customization

The platform supports five distinct form factors that determine how content is presented to users: Modal (with classic, horizontal split, and vertical split layouts), Popover (contextual overlays), Pin (persistent markers with overlay highlighting), Tooltip (hover/click reveal), and Banner (top/bottom positioning with sticky options). Each form factor supports multi-step functionality and interactive blocks including buttons, images, and videos with specific layout options and configurable actions.

## Advanced Targeting and Experimentation

The Setup and Targeting system provides granular control over user experiences through segment-based targeting (All Users vs Targeted Users), sophisticated trigger conditions, page targeting rules with URL pattern matching, priority levels (Urgent/High/Medium/Low), display limits with cooldown periods, and active state management with tiebreaker logic for handling multiple eligible experiences.

Integration with Amplitude Experiment enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on both guides and surveys, with variant configuration, experiment management, exposure event tracking, and comprehensive analytics through the insights dashboard.

## Technical Implementation

The **@amplitude/engagement-browser SDK** serves as the core integration point, providing methods for initialization (`engagement.init()`), boot process (`engagement.boot()`), theme management, callbacks, routing, and localization. The SDK integrates with the Amplitude Browser SDK, third-party analytics providers like Segment, and Google Tag Manager. Key SDK methods include `engagement.gs.show()`, `engagement.gs.reset()`, `engagement.gs.list()`, `engagement.gs.closeAll()`, and `addCallback()` for custom event handling.

For enterprise deployments, the platform supports AWS CloudFront reverse proxy configuration using dual origins (cdn.amplitude.com for static assets and gs.amplitude.com for API requests with /sdk/ prefix routing) to circumvent domain blocking while maintaining performance.

## Analytics and Insights

The platform provides comprehensive analytics through multiple interfaces. The Overview tab delivers real-time metrics including views, completions, rage closes, and interaction feeds. Survey analysis features include the Insights tab for aggregate data with type-specific insights (NPS scoring, list breakdowns), time-based engagement charts with Microscope integration for session replay analysis, and the Responses tab for individual user response analysis with advanced sorting and filtering capabilities.

Analytics events are tracked through a comprehensive taxonomy including common properties like Lifecycle UUID, Step ID, and Variant ID for A/B testing, plus specific events such as Guide Completed, Survey Submitted, and Tooltip Marker Viewed, all integrated with Amplitude's analytics platform.

## Localization and Theming

The localization system supports multilingual deployments through SDK locale initialization, Project settings for language management, and XLIFF file-based translation workflows. The platform can serve content in multiple languages with fallback behavior and inline translation updates.

The Themes system provides extensive customization through the Theme Editor with Brand controls for accent colors, typography (including Google font library integration), content colors, borders, backgrounds, form controls, cards, widget dimensions, and animations. The Component editor enables creation of reusable design elements across guides and surveys.

## Permissions and Access Control

A three-tier permission system (Viewer, Member, Manager) overrides base Amplitude user roles to provide granular access control for viewing, editing drafts, publishing, and running experiments within the Guides and Surveys module. This system enables organizations to maintain appropriate governance over their user experience programs.

## Content Management and Testing

The platform includes robust testing capabilities through preview mode, allowing developers to verify trigger, limit, and throttle conditions before launch. The testing interface provides condition status indicators, user history reset options, manual event triggering, and cohort-based live testing capabilities.

Content management extends beyond guides and surveys to include the Resource Center's Website scraper functionality, which can extract content from public websites using direct URLs or CSV/XML sitemap uploads, with advanced filtering options and content selectors for precise content curation.
