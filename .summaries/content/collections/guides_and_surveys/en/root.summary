Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user engagement platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to enhance user onboarding, collect feedback, and improve retention, activation, and engagement metrics. The platform enables product, growth, and product marketing teams to create contextual, interactive experiences directly within their applications across web, iOS, Android, and React Native platforms.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of three primary components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** are interactive, multi-step in-product messages that use behavioral triggers, strike detection, and rate-limiting mechanisms. They support six template types: Tours (step-by-step product walkthroughs), Announcements (feature updates and notifications), Checklists (task completion tracking), Carousels (swipeable content sequences), Banners (persistent messaging), and Tooltips (contextual help). Guides utilize five form factors: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual bubbles), Pin (anchored elements), Tooltip (hover information), and Banner (persistent strips), plus Checklist for task management.

**Surveys** focus on feedback collection through four specialized block types: Rating blocks (supporting Stars, NPS Net Promoter Score, and emoji ratings), Long answer blocks (open-ended responses), Short answer blocks (brief text input), and List blocks (multiple choice with randomization and "Other" options). Surveys support conditional logic for dynamic response branching and utilize a subset of guide form factors (modal, popover, pin).

**Resource Center** functions as an intelligent help widget that integrates external documentation repositories, provides semantic search capabilities, and offers personalized content recommendations. It features Autopilot functionality for automatic article surfacing, recommendation sets for curated content, quick links for common actions, and configurable launchers (pre-built icons, custom elements, or SDK-based triggers).

## SDK Integration and Technical Implementation

The platform operates through dedicated SDKs for each supported platform:

**Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with the Amplitude Browser SDK 2.0 as a plugin, supports third-party analytics providers like Segment, and offers Google Tag Manager integration. Key methods include `engagement.init()` and `engagement.boot()` for initialization, `engagement.gs.show()` and `engagement.gs.reset()` for guide management, `forwardEvent()` for trigger handling, and `setRouter()` for single-page application support.

**iOS SDK** (`AmplitudeEngagement`) requires iOS 15+ and Swift 5.9+, integrates via Swift Package Manager or CocoaPods, and uses `accessibilityIdentifier` for element targeting. The SDK supports SwiftUI through `.amplitudeView()` modifiers and includes screen tracking with `amplitudeEngagement.screen()`.

**Android SDK** (`amplitude-engagement-android`) requires Android API Level 24+ and Kotlin 1.8.22+, supports Jetpack Compose through `amplitudeView` modifiers, and uses `contentDescription` for element targeting.

**React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) integrates with `@amplitude/analytics-react-native` and requires `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` for data persistence.

## Advanced Targeting and Personalization

The platform employs sophisticated targeting mechanisms including user segmentation based on cohorts and properties, behavioral triggers (element appearance/clicks, time delays, rage clicks, user confusion, event tracking), session properties via `setSessionProperty()`, and page targeting with URL pattern matching and regex support. The system supports priority levels (urgent, high, medium, low) with tiebreaker rules for conflict resolution.

**Personalization** is achieved through the "Personalize with Variables" feature, which dynamically inserts client-side user properties into content with fallback value support. The platform includes comprehensive localization support with ISO 639 language codes, XLIFF file upload capabilities, and AI-powered translation using Claude.

## Analytics and Experimentation

Amplitude Experiment integration enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, with variant configuration, exposure event tracking, and performance analytics. The analytics schema includes comprehensive event tracking for Guide Viewed, Guide Completed, Guide Dismissed, Survey Submitted, Survey Abandoned, and Resource Center interactions, all integrated with Amplitude's analytics platform.

**Analysis capabilities** include the Insights tab for aggregate metrics and trends (with NPS-specific breakdowns), time-based analysis (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly), and the Responses tab for individual user data with CSV export support up to 10,000 responses.

## Customization and Theming

The **Themes system** provides comprehensive branding control through the Theme Editor, including Brand controls for accent colors and typography (Google Fonts integration), Component editor for form controls and widget dimensions, and platform-specific theme support. Custom CSS styling is available for web SDK implementations using `amplitude-engagement` CSS classes for targeting specific form factors and survey elements.

## Content Management and Workflow

The platform includes a robust **template system** for creating reusable starting points, **tags system** for content organization and bulk management, and **throttling configuration** for rate limiting with global settings and advanced tag-based controls. Content can exist in draft, published, or scheduled states with rollout percentage controls and bucketing mechanisms.

**Permission management** operates through a five-tier system (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) that overrides base Amplitude user roles, providing granular control over viewing, editing, publishing, and experiment execution capabilities.

## Resource Center Advanced Features

Resource Center's **Website scraper** functionality enables automatic content ingestion from documentation sites using URL extraction methods, CSV/XML sitemap uploads, and advanced filtering with content selector overrides. The **Autopilot feature** uses semantic search algorithms to analyze page content and automatically surface relevant articles as intelligent fallbacks when dedicated recommendation sets aren't configured.

**Recommendation sets** support seven action types: visit link, click element, run callback, open third-party chat, show guide/survey, open article, and play video, enabling comprehensive user journey orchestration within the help experience.

The platform supports proxy configurations through AWS CloudFront for enterprise deployments, Content Security Policy (CSP) compliance with nonce parameters, and Electron framework integration for desktop applications.
