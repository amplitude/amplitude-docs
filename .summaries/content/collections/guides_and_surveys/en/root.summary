Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to improve user onboarding, collect feedback, and enhance retention, activation, and engagement metrics. The platform targets product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams seeking to create seamless user journeys through contextual guidance and feedback collection.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The platform consists of three core components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** provide interactive user onboarding and feature discovery through five form factors: Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner, and Checklist. Each form factor supports multi-step functionality, customizable positioning, and interactive blocks including buttons, images, and videos. Guides utilize five template types (Tour, Announcement, Checklists, Banners, Tooltips) and incorporate behavioral triggers, strike detection, and rate-limiting mechanisms.

**Surveys** enable targeted feedback collection using four unique block types: Rating (Stars, NPS, Emoji, Rating labels), Long answer, Short answer, and List blocks. Surveys support conditional logic for dynamic response paths and utilize a subset of guide form factors (modal, popover, pin). Survey analysis includes aggregate metrics through the Insights tab and individual response data via the Responses tab.

**Resource Center** functions as a help widget that integrates with the Guides and Surveys SDK, providing search functionality, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. It features Autopilot functionality that uses semantic search to automatically generate content recommendations from documentation repositories.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**AmplitudeEngagement** - The core SDK class for initializing and managing guides and surveys across platforms (web, iOS, Android, React Native)

**Form Factors** - The visual presentation styles: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual bubbles), Pin (persistent elements), Tooltip (hover information), Banner (top/bottom bars), Checklist (task lists)

**Behavioral Triggers** - Event-based activation mechanisms including element appearance/clicks, time delays, smart delay, rage click, user confusion, and custom event tracking

**Strike Detection** - System for tracking user interaction patterns to optimize guide timing and relevance

**Rate-limiting/Throttling** - Controls for managing guide and survey frequency per user across different time periods (day/week/month/session)

**Lifecycle UUID** - Unique identifier for tracking user progression through guide/survey experiences

**Variant ID** - Identifier used for A/B testing and experimentation within the Amplitude Experiment integration

**Recommendation Sets** - Curated collections of articles and content for the Resource Center, configurable with targeting and priority levels

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Guides and Surveys integrates deeply with the broader Amplitude ecosystem through multiple touchpoints:

**Analytics Integration** - Native integration with Amplitude analytics for comprehensive event tracking, including guide/survey interactions, completions, and user behavior patterns. Events include Guide Engaged, Guide Step Completed, Survey Submitted, Survey Abandoned, and Tooltip Marker Viewed.

**Amplitude Experiment** - Full A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiment support for optimizing guide and survey performance, with variant configuration and exposure event handling.

**Microscope Integration** - Session replay functionality for analyzing user interactions with guides and surveys in real-time.

**Third-party Analytics** - Support for Segment analytics integration and Google Tag Manager for organizations using external analytics platforms.

## Technical Implementation

**SDK Installation and Configuration:**
- Web: `@amplitude/engagement-browser` package with `engagement.init()` and `engagement.boot()` methods
- iOS: Swift Package Manager/CocoaPods installation with `AmplitudeEngagement` class
- Android: Gradle dependencies with `AmplitudeEngagement` and API Level 24+ support
- React Native: `@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native` with deep linking support

**Key API Methods:**
- `engagement.gs.show()` - Display specific guides/surveys
- `engagement.gs.reset()` - Clear user history
- `engagement.forwardEvent()` - Track custom events for triggers
- `engagement.setRouter()` - SPA routing integration
- `engagement.updateLanguage()` - Localization support
- `handlePreviewLinkIntent()` - Preview mode configuration

**Proxy Configuration:**
AWS CloudFront reverse proxy setup with two origins (cdn.amplitude.com for static assets, gs.amplitude.com for API requests) and specific cache behaviors for the `/sdk/*` path pattern.

The platform includes comprehensive targeting capabilities with user segmentation, rollout percentages, cohort filtering, page targeting rules using CSS selectors and XPath, priority levels (Urgent, High, Medium, Low), and display limits. Content personalization is achieved through client-side user property variables, theme customization, and localization support with AI-powered translation capabilities and XLIFF file upload workflows.

Permission management operates on a five-tier system (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) that overrides base Amplitude user roles, providing granular control over viewing, editing, publishing, and experiment execution capabilities within the Guides and Surveys module.
