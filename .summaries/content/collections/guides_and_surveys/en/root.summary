Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user engagement platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to improve user onboarding, collect feedback, and enhance retention, activation, and engagement metrics. The platform targets product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams seeking to create seamless in-product user experiences.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of three primary components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** are interactive in-product experiences that help users navigate and understand features. They support five form factors (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner) and include templates for Tours, Announcements, Checklists, Banners, and Tooltips. Guides feature behavioral triggers, strike detection, and rate-limiting mechanisms to ensure optimal user experience.

**Surveys** enable targeted feedback collection through four unique block types: Rating (Stars, NPS, Emoji, Rating labels), Long answer, Short answer, and List blocks. Surveys support conditional logic for dynamic response paths and utilize a subset of guide form factors (modal, popover, pin) for deployment.

**Resource Center** is a help widget that integrates with the SDK to provide search functionality, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. It features Autopilot functionality that uses semantic search to automatically surface relevant articles from documentation repositories.

## SDK Integration and Platform Support

The platform provides comprehensive SDK support across multiple platforms:

- **Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with Amplitude Browser SDK, third-party analytics providers like Segment, and Google Tag Manager
- **iOS SDK** supports Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods installation with SwiftUI integration via `amplitudeView` modifier
- **Android SDK** supports Jetpack Compose through `.amplitudeView` modifier and traditional views via `contentDescription` targeting
- **React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) includes deep linking support

Key SDK methods include `engagement.init()`, `engagement.boot()`, `engagement.forwardEvent()`, and platform-specific targeting mechanisms using `accessibilityIdentifier` (iOS) and element targeting properties.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Form Factors** define the visual presentation of guides and surveys: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual bubbles), Pin (persistent elements), Tooltip (marker-based hints), Banner (full-width notifications), and Checklist (task-oriented interfaces).

**Targeting and Triggers** control when and to whom content appears. Targeting supports "All Users" vs "Targeted Users" with segments, rollout percentages, and bucketing units. Triggers include immediate, element-based, time delays, smart delay, rage click, user confusion, and event-based activation.

**Analytics Events** are tracked through Amplitude with specific properties including Lifecycle UUID, Step ID, Variant ID for A/B testing, and events like Guide Engaged/Completed/Dismissed and Survey Submitted/Abandoned/Completed.

**Throttling** controls the rate and frequency of guide/survey appearances through configurable limits and time periods (day/week/month/session).

## Advanced Features and Capabilities

**Experimentation** integrates with Amplitude Experiment to support A/B tests and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, including variant configuration, exposure event handling, and insights dashboard analytics.

**Localization** enables multi-language content delivery through SDK locale configuration, project language settings, fallback behavior, and content translation via web interface, AI localization, or XLIFF file upload.

**Personalization** uses the "Personalize with Variables" feature to dynamically insert client-side user properties into text blocks with fallback values when properties are unavailable.

**Themes** provide comprehensive branding customization including colors, typography, form controls, cards, widget dimensions, and animations through a Theme Editor with Brand controls and Component editor sections.

## Analytics and Analysis

The platform provides robust analytics through multiple interfaces:

- **Overview Dashboard** displays performance metrics including views, completions, rage closes, and real-time interactions
- **Survey Analysis** includes Insights tab for aggregate metrics and NPS breakdowns, plus Responses tab for individual user data with CSV export capabilities up to 10k responses
- **Microscope Integration** enables session replay analysis of user interactions

## Permission System and Management

The platform implements a five-tier permission system (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) that overrides base Amplitude user roles to provide granular access control for viewing, editing drafts, publishing, and running experiments within the Guides and Surveys module.

**Templates** enable creation of reusable starting points for guides and surveys with visibility management and automatic "Template" suffix naming conventions.

**Tags** provide organizational capabilities for guides and surveys with bulk operations, filtering, and management through the list view interface.

## Technical Configuration

**Proxy Setup** supports AWS CloudFront configuration as a reverse proxy with specific origins (cdn.amplitude.com for static assets, gs.amplitude.com for API requests) and critical `/sdk/*` path patterns for API routing.

**Testing and Preview** includes preview mode for verifying conditions and settings before launch, with troubleshooting capabilities and live testing using cohort targeting.

The platform integrates seamlessly with the broader Amplitude ecosystem, leveraging existing user segmentation, analytics infrastructure, and experimentation capabilities while providing specialized tools for in-product user engagement and feedback collection.
