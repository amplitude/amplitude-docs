Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user engagement platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to enhance user onboarding, collect feedback, and improve retention, activation, and engagement metrics. The platform enables product, growth, and product marketing teams to create contextual, interactive experiences directly within their applications.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of three primary components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** are interactive, multi-step experiences designed for user onboarding, feature announcements, and task completion guidance. They support five distinct form factors: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual bubbles), Pin (anchored elements), Tooltip (hover information), Banner (persistent notifications), and Checklist (task-oriented workflows). Guides utilize behavioral triggers, strike detection, and rate-limiting mechanisms to ensure optimal user experience.

**Surveys** focus on feedback collection through four specialized block types: Rating (Stars, NPS, Emoji, Rating labels), Long answer, Short answer, and List (multiple choice). Surveys support conditional logic for dynamic response branching and can be deployed using a subset of guide form factors (modal, popover, pin). The platform provides comprehensive analytics through Insights tabs for aggregate metrics and Responses tabs for individual user data, with export capabilities up to 10,000 responses.

**Resource Center** functions as a help widget that integrates search functionality, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. It features an Autopilot system that uses semantic search algorithms to automatically generate article recommendations by analyzing page content and surfacing relevant materials from content repositories.

## Multi-Platform SDK Implementation

The platform supports comprehensive cross-platform deployment through dedicated SDKs:

**Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with Amplitude Browser SDK, third-party analytics providers like Segment, and Google Tag Manager. Key methods include `engagement.init()`, `engagement.boot()`, `engagement.forwardEvent()`, `engagement.setThemeMode()`, and `engagement.gs.show()`. The SDK supports Content Security Policy (CSP) nonce, SPA navigation through `engagement.setRouter()`, and proxy configurations.

**iOS SDK** (`Amplitude-Engagement-Swift`) requires Swift 5.9 and iOS 15+, utilizing `AmplitudeEngagement` class with `AmplitudeBootOptions` for initialization. Element targeting uses `accessibilityIdentifier` and `amplitudeView` modifier, with screen tracking through `amplitudeEngagement.screen()`.

**Android SDK** (`amplitude-engagement-android`) supports Android API Level 24+ and Kotlin 1.8.22+, featuring Jetpack Compose integration through `.amplitudeView` modifier and traditional view targeting using `contentDescription` and `tag` selectors.

**React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) integrates with `@amplitude/analytics-react-native` and includes deep linking configuration through `handleURL()` function.

## Advanced Targeting and Personalization

The platform employs sophisticated targeting mechanisms including user segmentation, behavioral triggers (element appearance/clicks, time delays, rage clicks, user confusion, event tracking), session properties via `setSessionProperty()`, and page targeting with URL matching patterns. Priority levels (urgent, high, medium, low) and display limits ensure optimal user experience through active state management and tiebreaker rules.

**Personalization** is achieved through the "Personalize with Variables" feature, which dynamically inserts client-side user properties into guide and survey text blocks with configurable fallback values. The system supports comprehensive localization through SDK locale configuration, XLIFF file workflows, AI-powered translation with Claude, and fallback behavior management.

## Analytics and Experimentation

The platform generates detailed analytics through a comprehensive event schema including common properties (Lifecycle UUID, Step ID, Variant ID) and specific events for guides (Guide Viewed, Guide Completed, Guide Dismissed, Guide Engaged, Guide Rage closed) and surveys (Survey Submitted, Survey Abandoned, Survey Completed, Survey Step Completed).

**Amplitude Experiment integration** enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, with variant configuration, exposure event handling, and insights dashboard analytics for treatment vs control performance tracking.

## Customization and Theming

**Themes** provide comprehensive branding control through the Theme Editor, featuring Brand controls and Component editor sections for customizing accent colors, typography (Google fonts), form controls, widget dimensions, animations, and platform-specific styling for web and mobile.

**Custom CSS** support (web SDK only, beta feature) provides granular styling control through CSS class selectors targeting form factors and survey elements with `amplitude-engagement` CSS classes.

## Content Management and Organization

The platform includes robust content management through **tags** for organizing guides and surveys, **templates** for creating reusable starting points, and comprehensive **role-based permissions** with five access levels (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) that override base Amplitude user roles.

**Testing capabilities** include preview mode for verifying trigger, limit, and throttle conditions, with troubleshooting tools like Reset User History, Ignore Throttle Limits, and manual event triggering.

## Resource Center Ecosystem

The Resource Center extends the platform's capabilities through **recommendation sets** (customizable in-time articles), **source content management** (documentation repositories and video integration), **website scraper** functionality for URL extraction and content filtering, and **Autopilot** for automatic article surfacing using semantic search algorithms.

The platform integrates seamlessly with external systems through **proxy configuration** (AWS CloudFront), third-party chat modules, and comprehensive API endpoints accessible through the `/sdk/*` path pattern for state persistence and configuration management.
