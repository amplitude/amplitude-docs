Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user engagement platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to improve user onboarding, retention, activation, and engagement through contextual guides and targeted feedback collection. The platform enables product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams to create non-intrusive user experiences that guide users through product features and collect valuable feedback at strategic moments in the user journey.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of two primary components: **Guides** and **Surveys**, both sharing a common infrastructure while serving distinct purposes. Guides focus on user onboarding and feature discovery through interactive walkthroughs, while Surveys collect targeted user feedback and satisfaction metrics. Both components utilize the same SDK, targeting system, analytics framework, and theming capabilities, creating a unified user engagement ecosystem.

The system is built around the **Amplitude Guides and Surveys SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`), which can be implemented through multiple integration methods including the Amplitude Browser SDK plugin, third-party analytics platforms like Segment, or Google Tag Manager. The SDK provides core functionality through `engagement.init()` and `engagement.boot()` functions, requiring user identification via `user_id` or `device_id` parameters.

## Guide System and Templates

Guides offer five distinct templates optimized for different use cases:
- **Tour Template**: Multi-step walkthroughs for feature exploration and onboarding
- **Announcement Template**: Single-step notifications for new features or updates  
- **Checklists Template**: Task-oriented guides that track user progress
- **Banners Template**: Persistent messaging for important communications
- **Tooltips Template**: Contextual help that appears on hover or click

Each guide supports sophisticated targeting through behavioral triggers including element appearance detection, time-based delays, rage click detection, user confusion signals, and custom event tracking. The system uses CSS selectors and XPath expressions for precise element targeting.

## Survey System and Feedback Collection

Surveys provide three primary templates for feedback collection:
- **NPS (Net Promoter Score)**: Customer satisfaction measurement with promoter/detractor classification
- **User Feedback**: Open-ended feedback collection with conditional logic
- **Rating Surveys**: Star, emoji, or label-based rating systems

Survey analysis includes aggregate insights through the Insights tab with type-specific analytics, time-based engagement charts with Microscope integration for session replay analysis, and individual response analysis through the Responses tab with advanced filtering and sorting capabilities.

## Form Factors and User Interface

Both guides and surveys support five form factors that determine their visual presentation:
- **Modal**: Full-screen overlays with classic, horizontal split, or vertical split layouts
- **Popover**: Contextual overlays positioned relative to target elements
- **Pin**: Persistent markers with overlay highlighting capabilities
- **Tooltip**: Hover or click-activated contextual information
- **Banner**: Top or bottom-positioned messaging with sticky positioning options

Each form factor supports multi-step functionality, interactive blocks (buttons, images, videos), and customizable positioning properties. Button actions include visiting links, clicking elements, showing other guides/surveys, or executing custom callbacks.

## Targeting and Personalization System

The platform provides sophisticated targeting capabilities through the Setup and Targeting configuration system. User targeting supports both "All Users" and "Targeted Users" approaches using Amplitude segments. Trigger conditions include element appearance detection, smart time delays, rage click detection, user confusion signals, and custom event tracking.

Page targeting utilizes URL pattern matching with query parameter support, while priority levels (Urgent/High/Medium/Low) manage experience conflicts through tiebreaker logic. Display limits and cooldown periods prevent user fatigue, while active state management ensures appropriate experience delivery.

## Experimentation and A/B Testing

Integration with **Amplitude Experiment** enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on both guides and surveys. The system tracks variant exposure events, manages experiment configurations, and provides performance analytics through the Insights dashboard. Experiment management includes variant configuration, rollout percentage controls, and treatment vs. control group analysis with completion rate tracking.

## Analytics and Performance Monitoring

The platform provides comprehensive analytics through multiple interfaces:
- **Overview Tab**: Real-time performance metrics including views, completions, rage closes, and interaction feeds
- **Analytics Events**: Detailed event tracking with properties like Lifecycle UUID, Step ID, Variant ID for A/B testing
- **Microscope Integration**: Session replay analysis for user behavior understanding
- **Time-based Analysis**: Hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly performance trends

Key events tracked include Guide Completed, Survey Submitted, Tooltip Marker Viewed, and various interaction events with comprehensive property taxonomies for detailed analysis.

## Theming and Customization

The **Theme Editor** provides extensive customization capabilities through Brand controls and Component editors. Brand controls include accent colors, typography with Google font library integration, content colors, borders, backgrounds, form controls, cards, widget dimensions, and animations. The system supports light/dark mode toggling and CSS property customization for comprehensive visual control.

## Localization and International Support

Localization functionality supports multilingual deployments through SDK locale initialization, Project settings language configuration, and XLIFF file-based translation workflows. The system includes translation template downloads, locale code resolution, fallback translation behavior, and inline translation updates for Growth/Enterprise plan users.

## Permission System and Access Control

A three-tier permission system (Viewer, Member, Manager) overrides base Amplitude user roles to provide granular access control. Permissions cover viewing capabilities, draft editing, publishing rights, and experiment execution access. The system includes five access levels from "No access" to "Administrator" with specific capabilities for each role level.

## Technical Implementation and Integration

Key SDK methods include:
- `engagement.gs.show()`: Display specific guides/surveys
- `engagement.gs.reset()`: Reset user state
- `engagement.gs.list()`: Retrieve available experiences  
- `engagement.gs.closeAll()`: Dismiss all active experiences
- `forwardEvent()`: Event tracking integration
- `setThemeMode()`: Theme management
- `setRouter()`: SPA configuration
- `updateLanguage()`: Localization updates

The platform supports proxy configuration through AWS CloudFront for domain blocking circumvention, Content Security Policy compliance, and provides comprehensive troubleshooting tools including `_debugStatus()` for development debugging.

## Testing and Quality Assurance

Testing capabilities include preview mode for condition verification, cohort targeting for live testing, manual event triggering, user history reset functionality, and throttle limit bypassing for development purposes. The system provides visual condition status indicators and comprehensive testing workflows before production deployment.
