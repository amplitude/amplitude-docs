Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user engagement platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to enhance user onboarding, collect feedback, and improve retention, activation, and engagement metrics. The platform enables product, growth, and product marketing teams to create contextual, interactive experiences directly within their applications across web, iOS, Android, and React Native platforms.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of three primary components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** are interactive, multi-step in-product messages that use behavioral triggers, strike detection, and rate-limiting mechanisms. They support six template types: Tours (multi-step onboarding), Announcements (feature updates), Checklists (task completion), Carousels (swipeable content), Banners (persistent notifications), and Tooltips (contextual help). Guides utilize five form factors: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual bubbles), Pin (anchored elements), Tooltip (hover information), and Banner (persistent strips), plus Checklist for task management.

**Surveys** focus on feedback collection through four unique block types: Rating (stars, NPS, emoji), Long answer (text areas), Short answer (single-line inputs), and List (multiple choice with randomization). Surveys support conditional logic for dynamic response branching and utilize a subset of guide form factors (modal, popover, pin) with specialized settings for NPS scoring, ARIA labels, and pre-fill capabilities.

**Resource Center** is a help widget that integrates with the SDK to provide search functionality, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. It features an Autopilot system using semantic search algorithms to automatically surface relevant articles from content repositories, with configurable recommendation sets and priority-based display logic.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

The platform employs specific terminology for its analytics and configuration systems:

**Lifecycle UUID** serves as the primary identifier for tracking user journeys across guides and surveys. **Step ID** and **Step Index** track progression through multi-step experiences, while **Variant ID** supports A/B testing through Amplitude Experiment integration.

**Form Factors** define the visual presentation: Modal (full overlay), Popover (contextual positioning), Pin (element-anchored), Tooltip (hover-triggered), Banner (persistent display), and Checklist (task-oriented). Each supports customization properties including z-index positioning, alignment settings, and interactive behaviors.

**Targeting Resolution** uses behavioral triggers including element appearance/clicks, time delays, rage clicks, user confusion detection, and event tracking. The system employs **Priority Levels** (urgent, high, medium, low) with tiebreaker rules and **Throttling** mechanisms for rate limiting across global and tag-based categories.

**Source.type** categorizes trigger origins: nudge (behavioral), trigger (event-based), sdk (programmatic), and share_link (distributed). **App Type** distinguishes platforms (ios, android, react native, web) for cross-platform analytics.

## SDK Integration and API Endpoints

The platform provides native SDKs for all major platforms with consistent initialization patterns:

**Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates as an Amplitude Browser SDK plugin or standalone with third-party analytics. Key methods include `engagement.init()` and `engagement.boot()` for initialization, `setRouter()` for SPA navigation, `forwardEvent()` for trigger integration, and `show()`/`reset()`/`closeAll()` for programmatic control.

**iOS SDK** uses Swift Package Manager/CocoaPods installation with `AmplitudeEngagement` class initialization. Element targeting utilizes `accessibilityIdentifier` and `.amplitudeView()` SwiftUI modifiers, with `amplitudeEngagement.screen()` for tracking and `handleUrl()` for preview mode.

**Android SDK** (`amplitude-engagement-android`) supports Jetpack Compose through `amplitudeView` modifier and traditional views via `contentDescription`. The `AmplitudeEngagement` class handles initialization with `AmplitudeBootOptions` configuration.

**React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) integrates with `@amplitude/analytics-react-native` using `getPlugin()` method and `handleURL()` for deep linking.

All SDKs support preview mode through custom URL schemes (`mobile://amplitude/engagement/preview`) and provide debugging capabilities with `_startNudgeDebug` and `_debugStatus()` methods.

## Analytics and Event Schema

The platform generates comprehensive analytics events for Amplitude integration:

**Guide Events**: Guide Viewed, Guide Completed, Guide Dismissed, Guide Engaged with CTA engagement levels (primary, secondary, tertiary), snooze duration tracking, and Pin Target Not Found error handling.

**Survey Events**: Survey Submitted, Survey Abandoned, Survey Response with specialized properties including Survey Response Array, Survey Response Number, and NPS-specific promoter/passive/detractor classifications.

**Resource Center Events**: Article interactions, search queries, recommendation clicks, and Autopilot-generated suggestions with semantic search attribution.

All events include common properties: App Type, Lifecycle UUID, Step ID/Index, Variant ID, Is From Debug Mode, and Source.type for comprehensive user journey tracking.

## Advanced Features and Ecosystem Integration

**Experimentation** integrates with Amplitude Experiment for A/B testing and multi-armed bandit optimization, supporting variant configuration, exposure event handling, and performance analytics through the insights dashboard.

**Localization** supports ISO 639 language codes with XLIFF file workflows, AI-powered translation via Claude, and fallback behavior configuration for multi-language deployments.

**Personalization** uses client-side user properties through the "Personalize with Variables" feature, enabling dynamic content insertion with fallback values for missing properties.

**Themes** provide comprehensive branding control through the Theme Editor with Brand controls and Component editor sections, supporting Google Fonts integration, CSS property configuration, and platform-specific customization.

**Proxy Configuration** supports AWS CloudFront reverse proxy setup with three origins (cdn.amplitude.com, gs.amplitude.com, engagement-static.amplitude.com) and specific cache behaviors including `/sdk/*` wildcard patterns for API requests.

**Permissions System** implements role-based access control with five levels (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) that override base Amplitude user roles, providing granular control over viewing, editing, publishing, and experiment execution capabilities.

The platform integrates seamlessly with the broader Amplitude ecosystem, leveraging user segmentation, cohort targeting, session properties, and event tracking while providing specialized analytics through dedicated Insights and Responses tabs with CSV export capabilities up to 10,000 responses.
