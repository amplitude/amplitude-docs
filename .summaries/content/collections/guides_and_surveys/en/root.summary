# Amplitude Guides and Surveys

## Product Overview

Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive solution for creating in-product messages and collecting user feedback within digital products. The platform helps product teams, growth teams, and marketing teams improve user experience, facilitate product learning, gather feedback, and enhance key metrics like retention, activation, and engagement. It serves as an alternative to traditional popup components by providing more targeted, contextual, and less disruptive user interactions.

The product consists of two main components:

1. **Guides**: In-product messages that help users complete tasks or explore features using behavioral triggers. Available in five templates: Tour, Announcement, Checklist, Banner, and Tooltip.

2. **Surveys**: Targeted feedback collection tools with three template options: NPS (Net Promoter Score), User Feedback, and Rating surveys.
