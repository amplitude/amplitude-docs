Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user engagement platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to enhance user onboarding, collect feedback, and improve retention, activation, and engagement metrics. The platform enables product, growth, and product marketing teams to create contextual, interactive experiences directly within their applications across web, iOS, Android, and React Native platforms.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of three primary components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** are interactive, multi-step in-product messages that use behavioral triggers, strike detection, and rate-limiting mechanisms. They support six template types: Tours (step-by-step product walkthroughs), Announcements (feature updates and notifications), Checklists (task completion tracking), Carousels (swipeable content sequences), Banners (persistent messaging), and Tooltips (contextual help). Guides utilize five form factors: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual bubbles), Pin (anchored elements), Tooltip (hover information), and Banner (persistent strips), plus Checklist for task management.

**Surveys** focus on feedback collection through four specialized block types: Rating blocks (supporting Stars, NPS Net Promoter Score, and emoji ratings), Long answer blocks (open-ended responses), Short answer blocks (brief text input), and List blocks (multiple choice with randomization and "Other" options). Surveys support conditional logic for dynamic response branching and utilize a subset of guide form factors (modal, popover, pin).

**Resource Center** provides a searchable widget that integrates external documentation repositories, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. It features an Autopilot system using semantic search algorithms to automatically surface relevant articles based on page content analysis, serving as a smart fallback when dedicated recommendation sets aren't configured.

## Key Technical Integration

The platform integrates through SDK implementations across platforms:

- **Web SDK**: `@amplitude/engagement-browser` package with `engagement.init()` and `engagement.boot()` methods
- **iOS SDK**: AmplitudeEngagement with Swift Package Manager/CocoaPods, requiring iOS 15+ and Swift 5.9+
- **Android SDK**: `amplitude-engagement-android` with Jetpack Compose support, requiring Android API Level 24+
- **React Native SDK**: `@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native` with deep linking support

Critical API methods include `engagement.gs.show()` for display control, `setSessionProperty()` for dynamic targeting, `forwardEvent()` for trigger activation, and `setRouter()` for single-page application navigation.

## Advanced Targeting and Personalization

The platform employs sophisticated targeting mechanisms including user segmentation, behavioral triggers (element appearance/clicks, time delays, rage clicks, user confusion, event tracking), session properties, and page targeting with URL pattern matching. The system supports priority levels (urgent, high, medium, low) with tiebreaker rules, display limits with cooldown periods, and rollout percentage controls.

Personalization features include the "Personalize with Variables" system for dynamic content insertion using client-side user properties, comprehensive localization support with ISO 639 language codes, XLIFF file workflows, and AI-powered translation through Claude integration.

## Analytics and Experimentation

Amplitude Experiment integration enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, with comprehensive analytics event schema including Guide Viewed, Guide Completed, Guide Dismissed, Survey Submitted, Survey Abandoned, and Resource Center interaction events. The analytics system tracks properties like Lifecycle UUID, Step ID, Variant ID, App Type, and engagement levels (primary, secondary, tertiary).

Survey analysis includes aggregate metrics through the Insights tab with NPS breakdowns and trend analysis, plus individual response data through the Responses tab with CSV export capabilities up to 10,000 responses.

## Content Management and Workflow

The platform features a robust content management system with template creation for reusable starting points, theme customization through a Theme Editor with brand controls and component styling, and a comprehensive tags system for organization and advanced throttling strategies.

Permission management operates through a five-tier system (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) that overrides base Amplitude user roles, providing granular control over viewing, editing, publishing, and experiment execution capabilities.

## Technical Infrastructure

Advanced features include custom CSS styling support (web SDK only, beta status), proxy configuration through AWS CloudFront for unified distributions, Content Security Policy (CSP) support with nonce parameters, and comprehensive testing capabilities through preview mode with condition verification and live testing using cohort targeting.

The Resource Center's Website scraper feature supports URL extraction through direct URLs or CSV/XML sitemap uploads, with advanced filtering options and content selector overrides for targeting specific page elements.
