Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to improve user retention, activation, and engagement through targeted onboarding experiences and feedback collection. The platform enables product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams to create contextual, interactive experiences directly within their applications.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of three primary components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** are interactive, multi-step experiences designed for user onboarding, feature announcements, and product tours. They support five distinct form factors: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual bubbles), Pin (persistent sidebar elements), Tooltip (contextual markers), Banner (top/bottom notifications), and Checklist (task-oriented workflows). Each form factor offers extensive customization including position controls, z-index configuration, text animations with typewriter effects, and advanced trigger mechanisms.

**Surveys** focus on feedback collection through four specialized block types: Rating blocks (supporting Stars, NPS, Emoji, and custom Rating labels), Long answer blocks for detailed responses, Short answer blocks for brief inputs, and List blocks for multiple choice selections. Surveys implement conditional logic for dynamic response paths and support the same targeting mechanisms as guides.

**Resource Center** functions as an intelligent help widget that integrates with external documentation repositories, providing users with contextual assistance through semantic search, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. The Resource Center features an Autopilot system that automatically generates content recommendations using semantic search algorithms.

## Advanced Targeting and Behavioral Intelligence

The platform implements sophisticated targeting capabilities through the Setup and Targeting system. User targeting supports both broad "All Users" deployment and granular "Targeted Users" segmentation using property filtering and cohort analysis. Trigger conditions include element appearance detection, click tracking, time-based delays, smart delay algorithms, rage click detection, and user confusion identification.

Page targeting utilizes URL matching patterns with CSS selector and XPath expression support, while the visual selector tool enables precise element targeting without technical knowledge. The system implements priority levels (Urgent/High/Medium/Low) with tiebreaker logic for managing multiple eligible experiences, plus display limits and cooldown periods to prevent user fatigue.

## Multi-Platform SDK Ecosystem

Amplitude provides comprehensive SDK support across platforms:

**Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with Amplitude Browser SDK, third-party analytics providers like Segment, and Google Tag Manager. Key methods include `engagement.init()`, `engagement.boot()`, `forwardEvent()` for event-based triggers, `setThemeMode()` for theme management, and `updateLanguage()` for localization.

**Mobile SDKs** support iOS (Swift Package Manager/CocoaPods with `AmplitudeEngagement`), Android (gradle dependencies with `AmplitudeEngagement` class), and React Native (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`). Mobile implementations include deep linking support, screen tracking capabilities, and element targeting through accessibility identifiers.

## Analytics and Experimentation Framework

The platform integrates deeply with Amplitude's analytics ecosystem, tracking comprehensive event properties including Lifecycle UUID, Step ID, Variant ID for A/B testing, and specific events like Guide Completed, Survey Submitted, and Tooltip Marker Viewed. The analytics glossary defines a complete taxonomy of trackable interactions.

**Amplitude Experiment integration** enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, with variant configuration, exposure event handling, and insights dashboard analytics. The experimentation framework supports treatment vs control groups with configurable rollout percentages.

**Survey Analysis** provides aggregate insights through the Insights tab with NPS scoring (promoters/detractors/passives), type-specific breakdowns, and time-based engagement charts with Microscope integration for session replay analysis. The Responses tab enables individual user response analysis with advanced sorting and filtering capabilities.

## Localization and Content Management

The platform supports enterprise-grade localization through XLIFF file-based translation workflows, SDK locale initialization, and Project Settings language configuration. The system provides fallback behavior and multilingual preview capabilities for global deployments.

**Content sourcing** for Resource Center supports multiple methods including documentation repository sync, video integration, and Website scraper functionality. The scraper can extract content through direct URLs or CSV/XML sitemap uploads, with advanced filtering options and content selectors for targeting specific page elements.

## Theming and Customization

The comprehensive Themes system allows complete branding customization through the Theme Editor, featuring Brand controls and Component editor sections. Customizable elements include accent colors, Google Fonts typography, form controls styling, widget dimensions for all form factors, CSS properties configuration, animation settings, and platform-specific theme deployment.

## Permission and Access Control

The platform implements a sophisticated role-based permission system with five access levels: No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, and Administrator. These roles override base Amplitude user permissions to provide granular control over viewing, editing, publishing guides/surveys, and running experiments within the Guides and Surveys module.

## Technical Integration Features

Advanced technical capabilities include Content Security Policy (CSP) directive support, Single Page Application (SPA) router configuration, proxy setup through AWS CloudFront for domain blocking circumvention, and comprehensive callback systems for custom button actions. The platform supports both EU and US server zones with configurable endpoints.

The testing framework provides preview mode functionality with condition verification (trigger, limit, throttle), troubleshooting tools, and live testing through cohort targeting, enabling thorough validation before production deployment.
