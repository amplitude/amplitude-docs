Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user engagement platform that serves as an alternative to traditional popups, designed to enhance user onboarding, collect feedback, and improve retention, activation, and engagement metrics. The platform enables product, growth, and product marketing teams to create contextual, interactive experiences directly within their applications.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of three primary components that work together to deliver personalized user experiences:

**Guides** are interactive, multi-step experiences designed for user onboarding, feature announcements, and task completion guidance. They support five distinct form factors: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual bubbles), Pin (persistent markers), Tooltip (hover-triggered help), Banner (page-wide notifications), and Checklist (task-oriented workflows). Guides utilize behavioral triggers including element appearance/clicks, time delays, rage click detection, user confusion patterns, and custom event tracking.

**Surveys** focus on feedback collection through four specialized block types: Rating (Stars, NPS, Emoji, Rating labels), Long answer, Short answer, and List (multiple choice). Surveys support conditional logic for dynamic response branching and can be deployed using a subset of guide form factors (modal, popover, pin). The platform provides comprehensive analytics through an Insights tab for aggregate metrics and a Responses tab for individual user data with CSV export capabilities up to 10,000 responses.

**Resource Center** functions as a help widget that integrates search functionality, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. It features an Autopilot system that uses semantic search algorithms to automatically generate article recommendations by analyzing page content and surfacing relevant materials from configured content repositories.

## Multi-Platform SDK Ecosystem

The platform supports comprehensive cross-platform deployment through specialized SDKs:

The **Web SDK** (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`) integrates with the Amplitude Browser SDK as a plugin, supports third-party analytics providers like Segment, and includes Google Tag Manager templates. Key methods include `engagement.init()`, `engagement.boot()`, `engagement.forwardEvent()`, and `engagement.gs.show()` for programmatic control.

The **iOS SDK** (`Amplitude-Engagement-Swift`) supports Swift Package Manager and CocoaPods installation, utilizes `AmplitudeEngagement` class initialization, and implements element targeting through `accessibilityIdentifier` and `amplitudeView` modifier for SwiftUI components.

The **Android SDK** (`amplitude-engagement-android`) integrates with Jetpack Compose using `.amplitudeView` modifier and supports non-Compose views through `contentDescription` and `tag` selectors, with `AmplitudeEngagement` class handling initialization and screen tracking.

The **React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) provides deep linking support via `handleURL()` method and plugin booting with user/device ID configuration.

## Advanced Targeting and Personalization

The platform implements sophisticated targeting mechanisms through user segmentation, session properties via `setSessionProperty()`, page targeting with URL matching patterns, and priority levels (urgent, high, medium, low). The system supports rollout percentage bucketing, display limits with cooldown periods, and active state management with tiebreaker rules.

**Personalization capabilities** include the "Personalize with Variables" feature for dynamically inserting client-side user properties into content, localization support for multi-language deployment with XLIFF file workflows and AI-powered translation, and theme customization through a comprehensive Theme Editor with brand controls and component styling options.

## Analytics and Experimentation Framework

The platform provides extensive analytics through event tracking with properties like Lifecycle UUID for event grouping, Step ID and Step Index for navigation tracking, and Variant ID for A/B testing. Key events include Survey Submitted, Survey Abandoned, Guide Completed, Guide Dismissed, Tooltip Marker Viewed, and Rage Closed detection.

**Amplitude Experiment integration** enables A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, with variant configuration, exposure event handling, and insights dashboard analytics for treatment vs control performance tracking.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Form Factors**: The visual presentation modes (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner, Checklist) that determine how content appears to users.

**Blocks**: Content components within guides and surveys, including text, image, video, button, and survey-specific rating/input blocks.

**Triggers**: Behavioral conditions that activate guides/surveys, including element interactions, time-based delays, smart delays, rage clicks, and custom event tracking.

**Throttling**: Rate limiting mechanisms that control artifact appearance frequency through configurable limits across time periods (day/week/month/session).

**Lifecycle UUID**: Event property for grouping related analytics events within a single guide/survey interaction session.

**Strike Detection**: System for identifying when users repeatedly encounter or dismiss guides, used for rate-limiting decisions.

**Recommendation Sets**: Curated collections of articles and content for Resource Center, supporting various action types including visit link, click element, run callback, open third-party chat, show guide/survey, open article, and play video.

## Permission and Role Management

The platform implements a three-tier permission system (Viewer, Member, Manager) that overrides base Amplitude user roles, providing granular access control for viewing, editing drafts, publishing content, and running experiments. Administrators have full access across all functionality.

## Technical Integration Features

The platform supports **proxy configuration** through AWS CloudFront for unified content delivery, **Content Security Policy (CSP)** nonce support for security compliance, **custom CSS styling** through amplitude-engagement CSS classes (beta feature for web SDK), and **preview mode** for testing with condition verification and user history management.

**API endpoints** include `/sdk/*` path patterns for core functionality and `/sdk/admin/config` for preview mode configuration, while **command-line equivalent operations** are handled through SDK method calls like `engagement.setThemeMode()`, `engagement.updateLanguage()`, and `engagement.setSessionProperty()`.

The platform integrates seamlessly with the broader Amplitude ecosystem, leveraging user segmentation from Amplitude Analytics, experiment frameworks from Amplitude Experiment, and session replay capabilities through Microscope integration for comprehensive user experience analysis and optimization.
