## Product Overview

Amplitude's Guides and Surveys SDK is a user engagement platform that enables developers to create and deploy interactive user experiences through multiple form factors including banners, modals, popovers, tooltips, pins, and checklists. The SDK supports comprehensive survey functionality with various input types and provides extensive customization capabilities through CSS styling and multi-language localization features.

## Product Relationships and Features

The Guides and Surveys SDK operates as a cohesive engagement system where multiple components work together:

**Form Factor Ecosystem**: The SDK supports six distinct presentation formats (banner, modal, popover, tooltip, pin, checklist), each serving different user experience scenarios. These form factors share common underlying functionality while providing unique visual presentations and interaction patterns.

**Survey Integration**: Survey capabilities are deeply integrated across all form factors, supporting various input types including rating systems, checkboxes, radio buttons, and text inputs. Each survey element can be styled and localized independently while maintaining consistent behavior.

**Styling and Localization Layer**: Both custom CSS styling and localization features operate as overlay systems that enhance the core engagement functionality without disrupting the underlying SDK architecture.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Components**:
- **Form Factors**: The six presentation modes (banner, modal, popover, tooltip, pin, checklist) that determine how content is displayed to users
- **Engagement Plugin**: The primary SDK component initialized with `engagement.plugin` parameters
- **CSS Class Selectors**: Amplitude-specific CSS classes prefixed with `amplitude-engagement-` for targeting styling

**Localization Terms**:
- **Locale Parameter**: SDK initialization setting that determines the user's language preference
- **Fallback Behavior**: System response when translations are unavailable or outdated
- **Translatable Strings**: Text elements within guides and surveys that can be localized
- **XLIFF**: XML Localization Interchange File Format used for translation workflows

**Technical Identifiers**:
- Container classes: `amplitude-engagement-banner-container`, `amplitude-engagement-modal-overlay`
- Survey elements: Rating inputs, checkbox/radio selectors, CTA button styling
- Locale codes: Language resolution parameters for internationalization

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Guides and Surveys SDK integrates into Amplitude's broader analytics and engagement ecosystem through several touchpoints:

**Plan-Based Feature Access**: Localization functionality requires Growth or Enterprise plans, indicating integration with Amplitude's subscription and billing systems.

**Project-Level Configuration**: Settings are managed through "Project Settings > Guides and Surveys tab," suggesting integration with Amplitude's project management infrastructure.

**AI-Powered Features**: Claude AI integration for automated localization demonstrates connection to modern AI services within the platform.

**Web SDK Focus**: Current custom CSS support is limited to web SDK implementations, indicating a multi-platform architecture with web-first feature rollouts.

## Technical Implementation Details

**SDK Initialization**: 
- Locale configuration through `engagement.plugin` parameters during SDK setup
- Project-level language support configuration in administrative interface

**Styling Implementation**:
- CSS class-based targeting system using `amplitude-engagement-` prefixed selectors
- Form factor-specific container classes for granular styling control
- Survey element-specific selectors for input customization

**Localization Workflow**:
- Three-method translation approach: web interface, AI automation, and XLIFF file upload
- Template download system for translation preparation
- Language toggle interface for runtime language switching

**Beta Status**: Both custom CSS and certain localization features carry beta designations, indicating active development and potential API changes.

The SDK represents a comprehensive user engagement solution that balances ease of implementation with extensive customization capabilities, designed to scale across different user bases and international markets while maintaining integration with Amplitude's analytics ecosystem.
