# Amplitude PII Integrations

## Overview
Amplitude PII Integrations provide organizations with automated solutions for managing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in compliance with data privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA. These integrations connect Amplitude's analytics platform with third-party privacy management platforms to streamline the handling of Data Subject Requests (DSRs), allowing users to access, delete, or manage their personal data stored within Amplitude.

## Product Relationships and Features
Amplitude offers three primary PII management integrations:

1. **DataGrail Integration**: Connects Amplitude with DataGrail's privacy platform to facilitate DSR fulfillment, allowing companies to identify, retrieve, and delete PII in Amplitude through DataGrail's interface.

2. **Osano Integration**: Enables automated PII discovery, classification, and subject rights request handling between Osano's data privacy platform and Amplitude. This integration requires an Osano Enterprise plan.

3. **Transcend Integration**: Provides programmatic access and erasure of user device activity data stored in Amplitude through Transcend's privacy platform.

Each integration serves similar purposes but through different third-party platforms, giving customers flexibility in choosing their preferred privacy management solution while maintaining compliance with privacy regulations.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions
- **PII (Personally Identifiable Information)**: Data that can identify an individual user
- **DSR (Data Subject Request)**: Formal request by an individual to exercise their data privacy rights
- **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**: European Union privacy regulation
- **CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)**: California's data privacy law
- **API Key**: Authentication credential required for integration with Amplitude
- **Secret Key**: Secondary authentication credential used alongside the API Key
- **Data Store**: In Osano, the configuration section where Amplitude connection details are specified
- **Subject Rights Requests**: Formal requests from individuals to access, delete, or manage their personal data

## Product Ecosystem Integration
These PII integrations extend Amplitude's core analytics functionality by:

1. Enabling compliance with major privacy regulations without manual processes
2. Allowing organizations to maintain analytics capabilities while respecting user privacy rights
3. Providing automated mechanisms to handle data subject requests

The integrations leverage Amplitude's API infrastructure, with each third-party platform accessing Amplitude's PII management endpoints through secure authentication methods. This allows organizations to centralize their privacy compliance efforts through their chosen privacy management platform while ensuring that data in Amplitude remains compliant.

## Authentication and Setup
All three integrations require similar authentication methods:
- **API Key and Secret Key**: These credentials must be configured in the respective third-party platform

Specific setup requirements:
- **DataGrail**: Configuration using Amplitude API key and Secret Key
- **Osano**: Configuration in the Data Stores section using API key and Secret Key (Enterprise plan required)
- **Transcend**: Users must contact Transcend's support team for integration assistance

These integrations operate through Amplitude's API infrastructure, though specific API endpoints are not explicitly documented.
