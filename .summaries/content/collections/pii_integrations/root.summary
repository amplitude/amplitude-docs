# Amplitude PII Integrations

## Product Overview

Amplitude PII Integrations provide automated compliance solutions for handling personal identifiable information (PII) within Amplitude's analytics platform. These integrations enable organizations to efficiently respond to data subject requests (DSRs) required by privacy regulations such as GDPR, CCPA, and CPRA. The primary capabilities include identifying, retrieving, and deleting user data from Amplitude in response to privacy requests, creating a streamlined compliance workflow for organizations that collect and analyze user data.

## Product Relationships and Features

Amplitude currently offers three primary privacy management integrations:

1. **DataGrail Integration**: Connects Amplitude with DataGrail's privacy management platform to automate DSR fulfillment. This integration enables DataGrail to discover PII within Amplitude and process deletion or access requests automatically.

2. **Osano Integration**: Links Amplitude with Osano's data privacy platform, allowing for PII discovery, classification, and subject rights request handling. This integration requires an Osano Enterprise plan.

3. **Transcend Integration**: Connects Amplitude with Transcend's privacy platform, enabling programmatic access and erasure of user data across Amplitude's analytics environment.

All three integrations function as middleware between Amplitude's analytics platform and specialized privacy management solutions, creating an automated compliance layer for organizations using Amplitude.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **PII (Personally Identifiable Information)**: Any data that can be used to identify a specific individual user within Amplitude's analytics platform.
- **Data Subject Request (DSR)**: A formal request from an individual exercising their rights under privacy regulations to access, delete, or modify their personal data.
- **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**: European Union privacy regulation establishing rights for data subjects and obligations for data processors.
- **CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)**: California's data privacy law providing consumers with rights regarding their personal information.
- **CPRA (California Privacy Rights Act)**: Enhanced version of CCPA with additional privacy protections.
- **API Key**: Authentication credential required from Amplitude to establish connections with privacy platforms.
- **Secret Key**: Secondary authentication credential required for secure integration between Amplitude and privacy management platforms.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude PII Integrations position the analytics platform within a broader privacy compliance ecosystem. These integrations allow organizations to:

1. Maintain robust analytics capabilities while ensuring regulatory compliance
2. Automate otherwise manual privacy request fulfillment processes
3. Create auditable records of compliance activities
4. Reduce privacy-related operational overhead

The integrations serve as compliance bridges between Amplitude's core analytics functionality and the regulatory requirements that accompany user data collection and analysis. They extend Amplitude's utility by addressing the privacy dimension of data management without compromising analytical capabilities.

## Implementation Process

The implementation process for all three integrations follows a similar pattern:

1. Subscribe to the respective privacy platform (DataGrail, Osano, or Transcend)
2. Obtain Amplitude API Key and Secret Key from the Amplitude platform
3. Configure the integration within the privacy platform's administrative portal
4. Establish and verify the connection between systems

For technical implementation assistance, users are directed to contact the respective privacy platform's support teams, particularly noted for the Transcend integration.
