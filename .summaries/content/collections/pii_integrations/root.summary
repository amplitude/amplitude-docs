# Amplitude PII Integrations

## Product Overview

Amplitude PII Integrations provide automated solutions for managing personally identifiable information (PII) within the Amplitude analytics platform to help organizations comply with data privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. These integrations connect Amplitude with specialized third-party privacy management platforms to automate the handling of data subject requests (DSRs), including identification, retrieval, and deletion of personal data.

Key features include:
- Automated fulfillment of data subject requests
- Streamlined compliance with privacy regulations
- Secure authentication using Amplitude API credentials
- Integration with leading privacy management platforms

Primary use cases focus on efficiently responding to user requests regarding their personal data while maintaining analytics capabilities and ensuring regulatory compliance.

## Product and Feature Relationships

Amplitude offers three primary PII integrations:

1. **DataGrail Integration**: Connects Amplitude with DataGrail's privacy management platform to automate DSR fulfillment, allowing seamless discovery and management of user data within Amplitude.

2. **Osano Integration**: Links Amplitude with Osano's data privacy platform, enabling automated PII discovery, classification, and handling of subject rights requests through Osano's centralized interface.

3. **Transcend Integration**: Provides programmatic access and erasure capabilities for user device activity in Amplitude through Transcend's privacy platform, streamlining compliance workflows.

All three integrations serve the same fundamental purpose of automating privacy compliance but operate through different third-party platforms. Each requires proper authentication using Amplitude's API key and Secret Key configured within the respective privacy management platform.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **PII (Personally Identifiable Information)**: Data that can identify an individual user within Amplitude's analytics platform.

- **Data Subject Request (DSR)**: A formal request made by an individual to exercise their data rights under privacy regulations, such as access, deletion, or portability requests.

- **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**: European Union privacy regulation giving individuals control over their personal data.

- **CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)**: California privacy law providing residents with rights regarding their personal information.

- **API Key**: Authentication credential required to access Amplitude's API for data operations.

- **Secret Key**: Secondary authentication credential used with the API Key for secure access to Amplitude's data.

- **Data Store**: Configuration within privacy platforms that connects to external data sources like Amplitude.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude PII Integrations position the analytics platform within a broader data privacy ecosystem:

1. **Amplitude** functions as the analytics data repository containing user behavior data that may include PII.

2. **Third-party privacy platforms** (DataGrail, Osano, Transcend) serve as centralized hubs for managing privacy compliance across multiple systems.

3. When a data subject submits a request through one of these platforms, the integration enables the platform to:
   - Discover and classify PII within Amplitude
   - Retrieve relevant user data from Amplitude
   - Delete user data from Amplitude when required

This ecosystem approach allows organizations to maintain comprehensive privacy compliance across their entire technology stack, with Amplitude being one component of that ecosystem. The integrations enable a unified approach to privacy management rather than requiring separate processes for each system.

## Authentication and Configuration

All three integrations follow a similar authentication pattern:

1. Obtain an API Key and Secret Key from Amplitude.
2. Configure these credentials in the respective privacy platform:
   - **DataGrail**: Add credentials to the Amplitude integration setup
   - **Osano**: Enter credentials in the Data Stores section (requires Enterprise plan)
   - **Transcend**: Use credentials during integration setup for authentication

The privacy management platforms handle the API interactions internally after configuration, abstracting the technical implementation details from the end users.
