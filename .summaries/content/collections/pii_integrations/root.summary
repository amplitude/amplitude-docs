## Amplitude PII Integrations

Amplitude's PII Integrations represent a comprehensive privacy management ecosystem designed to automate compliance with major data privacy regulations including GDPR, CCPA, and CPRA. The product enables organizations to fulfill data subject requests, discover and classify personally identifiable information, and execute programmatic data access and erasure operations through strategic third-party integrations.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The PII integrations ecosystem operates through three complementary partner integrations that collectively address the complete privacy compliance lifecycle:

**DataGrail Integration** functions as the automated DSR fulfillment engine, managing the operational workflow aspects of privacy compliance. This integration streamlines cross-functional privacy team operations by automating Data Subject Request processing through API-driven mechanisms, reducing regulatory risk through continuous system detection capabilities.

**Osano Integration** provides the foundational discovery and classification layer for PII management. Operating through Data Discovery Data Stores, this integration automatically identifies and categorizes personally identifiable information within Amplitude's data ecosystem. The integration requires an Osano Enterprise plan and maintains comprehensive visibility into data assets across the platform.

**Transcend Integration** delivers the execution layer through programmatic access and erasure capabilities. This partner-maintained integration enables direct manipulation of user device activity data, providing the technical infrastructure necessary for data transparency initiatives and consent control mechanisms.

## Core Nomenclature and Definitions

**Data Subject Request (DSR)**: Formal requests submitted by individuals exercising privacy rights under GDPR, CCPA, or CPRA regulations, encompassing rights to access, delete, or modify personal data stored within Amplitude's systems.

**PII Management Integration**: Third-party platform connections that extend Amplitude's native privacy capabilities through specialized privacy management solutions, enabling automated compliance workflows.

**Subject Rights Requests**: Comprehensive category covering all individual privacy rights exercises, including data access requests, deletion requests, data portability requests, and consent management operations.

**Programmatic Data Access and Erasure**: Automated technical systems enabling retrieval and deletion of user data without manual intervention, essential for achieving scalable privacy compliance across large data volumes.

**Continuous System Detection**: Ongoing automated monitoring and identification of data processing activities and PII storage locations across integrated systems and data stores.

## Ecosystem Integration and Technical Architecture

The PII integrations operate within Amplitude's broader analytics platform through a standardized authentication and security model. All integrations require consistent credential management including Amplitude API keys and secret keys for secure communication channels.

The three-phase privacy compliance lifecycle is addressed through specialized integration roles:

- **Discovery Phase**: Osano performs automated PII identification and classification across Amplitude's data stores
- **Request Processing Phase**: DataGrail manages DSR workflow automation and cross-functional team coordination  
- **Data Action Phase**: Transcend executes programmatic data access and erasure operations

## Authentication and Implementation Requirements

Technical implementation follows a consistent authentication pattern across all integrations:
- Amplitude API key configuration for platform access
- Secret key authentication setup for secure communication
- Partner platform-specific credentials (Osano Enterprise plan access, DataGrail beta program participation)

The integrations operate as partner-maintained solutions, with privacy management platforms handling technical maintenance and system updates while Amplitude provides the underlying data access layer and API endpoints for secure integration connectivity.

This architecture enables organizations to maintain automated GDPR, CCPA, and CPRA compliance through streamlined workflows that reduce manual privacy team operational overhead while ensuring comprehensive coverage of data subject rights across Amplitude's analytics and data management platform.
