## Amplitude PII Integrations

Amplitude's PII Integrations represent a comprehensive privacy management ecosystem designed to automate compliance with global data protection regulations including GDPR, CCPA, and CPRA. This suite of integrations transforms Amplitude's analytics platform into a privacy-compliant data environment through strategic partnerships with leading privacy management platforms, enabling automated discovery, classification, and management of personally identifiable information.

## Product Relationships and Integration Architecture

The PII integrations ecosystem operates through three complementary privacy platform partnerships, each addressing distinct aspects of data protection compliance:

**DataGrail Integration** functions as the core privacy management hub, specializing in automated data subject request (DSR) fulfillment workflows. This integration provides privacy teams with programmatic capabilities to identify, retrieve, and delete PII across Amplitude's systems through API-driven processes, currently operating in beta status with ongoing feature development.

**Osano Integration** delivers continuous data monitoring and classification services, automatically scanning and categorizing PII to maintain real-time compliance posture. This Enterprise-tier integration operates at the data discovery level, providing foundational intelligence for subject rights request processing and regulatory reporting requirements.

**Transcend Integration** offers specialized programmatic access and erasure capabilities focused specifically on user device activity data, enabling granular control over data deletion processes required for comprehensive regulatory compliance and individual privacy rights fulfillment.

The architecture employs a unified authentication framework across all integrations, utilizing Amplitude's standard API Key and Secret Key authentication model to ensure consistent access control and security posture throughout the privacy management ecosystem.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Data Subject Request (DSR)**: Formal requests submitted by individuals exercising privacy rights under GDPR, CCPA, or CPRA regulations, encompassing rights to access, delete, rectify, or port personal data stored within Amplitude's analytics platform.

**PII Discovery and Classification**: Automated processes that systematically identify, categorize, and tag personally identifiable information within datasets to ensure appropriate handling, retention, and deletion in accordance with privacy regulations and organizational policies.

**Subject Rights Requests**: Comprehensive category of individual privacy rights including data portability, rectification, erasure, and access requests that organizations must fulfill within regulatory timeframes.

**Cross-functional DSR Fulfillment**: Collaborative workflows spanning privacy, legal, and technical teams to coordinate response to data subject requests across multiple systems, platforms, and data repositories.

**Programmatic Data Access and Erasure**: API-driven automation capabilities that enable compliance workflows to execute without manual intervention, ensuring consistent, auditable, and timely responses to privacy requests.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The PII integrations operate as a critical compliance infrastructure layer within Amplitude's analytics ecosystem, bridging enterprise privacy requirements with comprehensive user behavior analytics capabilities. This integration approach enables organizations to maintain sophisticated analytics insights while adhering to stringent data protection regulations without compromising analytical depth or operational efficiency.

The privacy management architecture follows a hub-and-spoke model where Amplitude serves as the central analytics data repository while specialized privacy platforms provide domain-specific compliance capabilities. This design allows organizations to implement best-of-breed privacy tools while maintaining centralized analytics data management and unified compliance oversight.

The integrations leverage Amplitude's existing API infrastructure and authentication patterns, ensuring seamless integration with current Amplitude implementations without requiring significant architectural modifications or data migration efforts. This approach minimizes implementation complexity while maximizing compliance capabilities.

## Authentication and Technical Implementation

All PII integrations utilize Amplitude's standardized authentication framework requiring:
- **Amplitude API Key**: Primary authentication credential for platform access and integration authorization
- **Secret Key**: Secondary authentication credential providing enhanced security for sensitive privacy operations

The DataGrail integration operates in beta status, indicating active development and feature refinement cycles. The Osano integration requires Enterprise plan subscription, reflecting advanced feature sets and enhanced support infrastructure for complex enterprise privacy requirements and high-volume data processing scenarios.

These integrations embody Amplitude's privacy-by-design philosophy, enabling organizations to harness powerful analytics capabilities while maintaining comprehensive compliance with evolving global privacy regulations and individual data protection rights.
