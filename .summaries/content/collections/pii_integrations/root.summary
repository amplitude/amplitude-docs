# Amplitude PII Integrations

## Product Overview

Amplitude PII Integrations provide organizations with automated solutions for managing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) within Amplitude's analytics platform. These integrations enable compliance with global data privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA by automating the identification, retrieval, and deletion of personal data in response to Data Subject Requests (DSRs). The primary value proposition is streamlining privacy compliance operations while maintaining the analytical capabilities of Amplitude.

## Key Features

- **Automated DSR Processing**: Programmatically fulfill user requests to access, modify, or delete personal data
- **Regulatory Compliance Management**: Meet requirements for GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy frameworks
- **PII Discovery and Classification**: Identify and categorize personal data stored within Amplitude
- **Data Erasure Workflows**: Systematically remove user data when requested
- **Privacy Operations Integration**: Incorporate privacy management into existing data systems

## Product Relationships and Ecosystem

Amplitude offers three primary PII management integrations that function as middleware between Amplitude's analytics platform and privacy management operations:

1. **DataGrail Integration**: Connects DataGrail's privacy management platform to Amplitude for automated DSR fulfillment
2. **Osano Integration**: Links Osano's data privacy platform to Amplitude for discovery and classification
3. **Transcend Integration**: Connects Transcend's privacy platform to Amplitude for programmatic data access and erasure

These integrations operate within Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem, allowing organizations to maintain privacy compliance without sacrificing analytical capabilities. They serve as the privacy management layer that interfaces between user privacy requests and the underlying Amplitude data stores.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **PII (Personally Identifiable Information)**: Data that can directly or indirectly identify an individual user
- **DSR (Data Subject Request)**: Formal request from an individual regarding their personal data (access, deletion, etc.)
- **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**: European Union's comprehensive privacy regulation
- **CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)**: California's state-level privacy regulation
- **API Key**: Primary authentication credential for accessing Amplitude's API endpoints
- **Secret Key**: Secondary authentication credential required for secure API access
- **Data Subject**: Individual whose personal data is being processed in Amplitude
- **Privacy Platform**: Third-party system (DataGrail, Osano, or Transcend) that manages privacy requests

## Integration Architecture

All three integrations follow a similar architectural pattern:

1. The privacy platform establishes a connection to Amplitude using API authentication
2. When a DSR is received, the platform queries Amplitude to identify relevant PII
3. Based on the request type, the platform either retrieves or deletes the identified data
4. The process is automated through API calls to ensure timely compliance with regulatory timeframes

## Authentication Requirements

Each integration requires the following Amplitude credentials:
- Amplitude API Key
- Amplitude Secret Key

These credentials must be configured during the integration setup process to establish secure API communication between the privacy platform and Amplitude.

## Implementation Process

The general implementation workflow includes:
1. Obtaining necessary Amplitude API credentials
2. Configuring the connection in the chosen privacy platform
3. Mapping data fields and user identifiers between systems
4. Testing the integration with sample DSRs
5. Deploying to production environment

For specific integration details, users are directed to contact the respective privacy platform provider (DataGrail, Osano, or Transcend) for implementation assistance and documentation.
