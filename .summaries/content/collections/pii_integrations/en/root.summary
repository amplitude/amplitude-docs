## Amplitude PII Integrations

Amplitude provides a comprehensive suite of privacy management integrations designed to help organizations comply with modern data protection regulations including GDPR, CCPA, and CPRA. These integrations enable automated discovery, classification, and management of personally identifiable information (PII) within Amplitude's analytics platform through partnerships with leading privacy management platforms.

## Product Relationships and Integration Architecture

The PII integrations directory encompasses three distinct privacy platform partnerships that work in concert to provide comprehensive data protection capabilities:

**DataGrail Integration** serves as the foundational privacy management platform integration, focusing on automated data subject request (DSR) fulfillment. This integration enables privacy teams to programmatically identify, retrieve, and delete PII from Amplitude's systems using API-based authentication mechanisms.

**Osano Integration** complements the DSR capabilities by providing automated PII discovery and classification services. This integration operates at the data monitoring level, continuously scanning and categorizing data to maintain compliance posture and support subject rights request processing.

**Transcend Integration** extends the ecosystem by offering programmatic access and erasure capabilities specifically for user device activity data, providing granular control over data deletion processes required for regulatory compliance.

All three integrations utilize Amplitude's core authentication framework through API Key and Secret Key pairs, creating a unified access control model across the privacy management ecosystem.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Data Subject Request (DSR)**: Formal requests from individuals exercising their privacy rights under GDPR, CCPA, or CPRA regulations, including rights to access, delete, or modify their personal data.

**PII Discovery and Classification**: Automated processes that identify and categorize personally identifiable information within datasets to ensure proper handling and compliance with privacy regulations.

**Subject Rights Requests**: Broader category encompassing all individual privacy rights including data portability, rectification, and erasure requests.

**Cross-functional DSR Fulfillment**: Collaborative processes between privacy, legal, and technical teams to respond to data subject requests across multiple systems and platforms.

**Programmatic Data Access and Erasure**: API-driven capabilities that enable automated compliance workflows without manual intervention.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The PII integrations function as a critical compliance layer within Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem. These integrations bridge the gap between Amplitude's core analytics capabilities and enterprise privacy requirements, enabling organizations to maintain comprehensive user behavior analytics while adhering to strict data protection regulations.

The integrations operate through Amplitude's standard API infrastructure, leveraging existing authentication and data access patterns. This approach ensures that privacy management capabilities integrate seamlessly with existing Amplitude implementations without requiring significant architectural changes.

The privacy platform partnerships represent a hub-and-spoke model where Amplitude serves as the central data repository while specialized privacy platforms provide domain-specific compliance capabilities. This architecture allows organizations to choose best-of-breed privacy tools while maintaining centralized analytics data management.

## Authentication and API Framework

All PII integrations utilize Amplitude's standard authentication model requiring:
- **Amplitude API Key**: Primary authentication credential for platform access
- **Secret Key**: Secondary authentication credential for enhanced security

The DataGrail integration specifically operates in beta status, indicating ongoing development and refinement of the integration capabilities. The Osano integration requires an Enterprise plan subscription, suggesting advanced feature sets and enhanced support levels for complex enterprise privacy requirements.

These integrations represent Amplitude's commitment to privacy-by-design principles, enabling organizations to leverage powerful analytics capabilities while maintaining full compliance with evolving global privacy regulations.
