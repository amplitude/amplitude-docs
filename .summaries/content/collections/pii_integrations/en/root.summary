# Amplitude PII Integrations

## Overview

Amplitude offers integrations with several privacy management platforms to help organizations comply with data privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. These integrations enable the identification, retrieval, and deletion of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) stored within Amplitude's analytics platform. The primary purpose of these integrations is to automate and streamline the process of fulfilling Data Subject Requests (DSRs) while maintaining compliance with global privacy regulations.

## Key Features and Use Cases

- **Automated Data Subject Request Fulfillment**: Process user requests to access, modify, or delete their personal data
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meet requirements for GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations
- **PII Discovery and Classification**: Identify and categorize personal data stored in Amplitude
- **Data Erasure**: Programmatically delete user data when requested
- **Streamlined Privacy Operations**: Integrate privacy management into existing data workflows

## Integration Partners

Amplitude currently offers PII management integrations with three privacy platforms:

1. **DataGrail**: A privacy management platform for automated DSR fulfillment
2. **Osano**: A data privacy platform for data discovery and classification
3. **Transcend**: A privacy platform for programmatic data access and erasure

## Integration Architecture

All three integrations follow a similar pattern:

1. The privacy platform connects to Amplitude using API authentication
2. When a DSR is received, the platform identifies relevant PII in Amplitude
3. The platform can then retrieve or delete the data as requested
4. This process is automated to ensure timely compliance with privacy regulations

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **PII (Personally Identifiable Information)**: Any data that can be used to identify an individual
- **DSR (Data Subject Request)**: A formal request from an individual regarding their personal data
- **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**: European privacy regulation
- **CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)**: California's privacy regulation
- **API Key**: Authentication credential required to access Amplitude's API
- **Secret Key**: Secondary authentication credential for secure API access
- **Data Subject**: An individual whose personal data is being processed

## Authentication Requirements

All integrations require the following Amplitude credentials:
- Amplitude API Key
- Amplitude Secret Key

These credentials must be provided during the integration setup process to establish a secure connection between the privacy platform and Amplitude.
