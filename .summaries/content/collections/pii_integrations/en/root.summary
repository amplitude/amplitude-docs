# Amplitude PII Integrations

## Overview

Amplitude offers integrations with third-party privacy management platforms to help organizations comply with data privacy regulations such as GDPR, CCPA, and CPRA. These integrations enable automated handling of data subject requests (DSRs) for personal identifiable information (PII) stored within Amplitude's analytics platform. The primary functionality includes identifying, retrieving, and deleting user data in response to privacy requests, streamlining compliance workflows for organizations that collect and analyze user data.

## Key Integrations

Amplitude currently supports three main privacy management integrations:

1. **DataGrail** - A privacy management platform that automates data subject request fulfillment
2. **Osano** - A data privacy platform for PII discovery, classification, and subject rights request handling
3. **Transcend** - A privacy platform enabling programmatic access and erasure of user data

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **PII (Personally Identifiable Information)** - Data that can be used to identify an individual user
- **Data Subject Request (DSR)** - A formal request from an individual to exercise their data privacy rights
- **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)** - European Union privacy regulation
- **CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)** - California's data privacy law
- **CPRA (California Privacy Rights Act)** - Enhanced version of CCPA
- **API Key** - Authentication credential required to connect privacy platforms to Amplitude
- **Secret Key** - Secondary authentication credential required for secure integration

## Integration Setup Process

All three integrations follow a similar setup pattern:

1. Subscribe to the respective privacy platform (DataGrail, Osano, or Transcend)
2. Obtain Amplitude API Key and Secret Key credentials
3. Configure the integration within the privacy platform's portal
4. Verify the connection between the systems

For Osano specifically, an Enterprise plan is required to enable the integration.

## Technical Implementation

The integrations operate by allowing the privacy platforms to:

1. Discover and classify PII within Amplitude
2. Process data subject requests through API connections
3. Automate the retrieval and deletion of user data
4. Provide audit trails for compliance documentation

Each integration uses Amplitude's API endpoints for authentication and data operations, though specific API endpoints are not detailed in the documentation.

## Product Ecosystem Context

These PII integrations position Amplitude as part of a broader privacy compliance ecosystem. Organizations using Amplitude for analytics can maintain their data analysis capabilities while ensuring compliance with privacy regulations through these third-party integrations. The integrations complement Amplitude's core analytics functionality by addressing the privacy requirements that come with collecting and processing user data.

For implementation assistance, users are directed to contact the respective privacy platform's support teams, particularly noted for Transcend integration.
