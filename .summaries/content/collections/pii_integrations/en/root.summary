## Amplitude PII Integrations

Amplitude provides a comprehensive PII (Personally Identifiable Information) management system through strategic integrations with leading privacy management platforms. This collection focuses on third-party integrations that enable automated compliance with major data privacy regulations including GDPR, CCPA, and CPRA.

## Product Relationships and Integration Architecture

The PII integrations directory encompasses three primary partner integrations that work in concert with Amplitude's core analytics platform:

**DataGrail Integration** serves as the automated DSR (Data Subject Request) fulfillment engine, handling the operational aspects of privacy compliance through API-driven request processing. This integration focuses on streamlining cross-functional privacy team workflows and reducing regulatory risk through continuous system detection.

**Osano Integration** provides the discovery and classification layer, automatically identifying and categorizing PII within Amplitude's data ecosystem. This integration requires an Osano Enterprise plan and operates through Data Discovery Data Stores to maintain comprehensive visibility into data assets.

**Transcend Integration** delivers the programmatic access and erasure capabilities, enabling direct manipulation of user device activity data to fulfill privacy requests. This partner-maintained integration provides the technical infrastructure for data transparency and consent control mechanisms.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Data Subject Request (DSR)**: Formal requests from individuals exercising their privacy rights under GDPR, CCPA, or CPRA regulations, including rights to access, delete, or modify personal data.

**PII Management Integration**: Third-party connections that extend Amplitude's native privacy capabilities through specialized privacy management platforms.

**Subject Rights Requests**: Broader category encompassing all individual privacy rights exercises, including access requests, deletion requests, and data portability requests.

**Programmatic Data Access and Erasure**: Automated systems for retrieving and deleting user data without manual intervention, essential for scalable privacy compliance.

**Continuous System Detection**: Ongoing monitoring and identification of data processing activities and PII storage locations across integrated systems.

## Ecosystem Integration and Authentication

All three integrations operate within Amplitude's broader privacy compliance ecosystem through standardized authentication mechanisms. Each integration requires Amplitude API keys and secret keys for secure communication, establishing a consistent security model across the privacy management stack.

The integrations collectively address the complete privacy compliance lifecycle:
- **Discovery Phase**: Osano identifies and classifies PII across data stores
- **Request Processing**: DataGrail automates DSR workflow management
- **Data Action**: Transcend executes programmatic access and erasure operations

## Technical Implementation

Authentication across all integrations follows a consistent pattern requiring:
- Amplitude API key configuration
- Secret key authentication setup
- Partner platform-specific credentials (Osano Enterprise plan, DataGrail beta access)

The integrations operate as partner-maintained solutions, meaning the privacy platforms handle the technical maintenance and updates while Amplitude provides the data access layer and API endpoints for secure integration.

This architecture enables organizations to maintain GDPR, CCPA, and CPRA compliance through automated workflows that reduce manual privacy team overhead while ensuring comprehensive coverage of data subject rights across Amplitude's analytics platform.
