# Amplitude PII Integrations

## Overview

Amplitude offers integrations with third-party privacy management platforms to help organizations comply with data privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. These integrations enable automated handling of data subject requests (DSRs), including the identification, retrieval, and deletion of personally identifiable information (PII) stored within Amplitude's analytics platform.

The primary use case for these integrations is to streamline compliance with privacy regulations by automating the process of responding to user requests regarding their personal data. This allows companies to efficiently manage data subject rights while maintaining their analytics capabilities.

## Product Relationships and Features

Amplitude's PII integrations connect the analytics platform with specialized privacy management solutions:

1. **DataGrail Integration**: Connects Amplitude with DataGrail's privacy management platform to automate data subject request fulfillment.

2. **Osano Integration**: Links Amplitude with Osano's data privacy platform for automated PII discovery, classification, and subject rights request handling.

3. **Transcend Integration**: Enables programmatic access and erasure of user device activity in Amplitude through Transcend's privacy platform.

Each integration serves the same core purpose but operates through different third-party platforms. All integrations require authentication using Amplitude's API key and Secret Key, which must be configured in the respective privacy management platform.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **PII (Personally Identifiable Information)**: Data that can be used to identify an individual user.

- **Data Subject Request (DSR)**: A formal request made by an individual to exercise their data rights under privacy regulations.

- **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**: European Union privacy regulation that gives individuals control over their personal data.

- **CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)**: California privacy law that provides residents with rights regarding their personal information.

- **API Key**: Authentication credential required to access Amplitude's API.

- **Secret Key**: Secondary authentication credential used in conjunction with the API Key for secure access to Amplitude's data.

- **Data Store**: In the context of privacy platforms, this refers to the configuration that connects to external data sources (like Amplitude).

## Product Ecosystem Integration

These PII integrations position Amplitude within a broader data privacy ecosystem:

1. Amplitude serves as the analytics data repository containing user behavior data that may include PII.

2. The third-party privacy platforms (DataGrail, Osano, Transcend) act as centralized hubs for managing privacy compliance across multiple systems.

3. When a data subject submits a request through one of these platforms, the integration allows the platform to:
   - Discover and classify PII within Amplitude
   - Retrieve relevant user data from Amplitude
   - Delete user data from Amplitude when required

This ecosystem approach allows organizations to maintain a comprehensive privacy compliance program across their entire tech stack, with Amplitude being one component of that ecosystem.

## Authentication and Configuration

All three integrations follow a similar authentication pattern:

1. Obtain an API Key and Secret Key from Amplitude.
2. Configure these credentials in the respective privacy platform:
   - In DataGrail: Add them to the Amplitude integration setup
   - In Osano: Enter them in the Data Stores section
   - In Transcend: Use them for authentication during integration setup

The Osano integration specifically notes that it requires an Enterprise plan.

No specific API endpoints or command line invocations are detailed in the documentation, as these are handled internally by the privacy management platforms after configuration.
