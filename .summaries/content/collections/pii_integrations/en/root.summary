# Amplitude PII Integrations

## Overview

Amplitude offers integrations with third-party privacy management platforms to help organizations comply with data privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA. These integrations enable the identification, retrieval, and deletion of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) stored within Amplitude's analytics platform. The primary use case is to automate and streamline the handling of Data Subject Requests (DSRs) where individuals exercise their rights to access, delete, or manage their personal data.

## Product Relationships and Features

Amplitude currently offers three main PII management integrations:

1. **DataGrail Integration**: Connects Amplitude with DataGrail's privacy management platform to facilitate DSR fulfillment. This integration allows companies to identify, retrieve, and delete PII in Amplitude through DataGrail's interface.

2. **Osano Integration**: Enables automated PII discovery, classification, and subject rights request handling between Osano's data privacy platform and Amplitude.

3. **Transcend Integration**: Provides programmatic access and erasure of user device activity data stored in Amplitude through Transcend's privacy platform.

All three integrations serve similar purposes but through different third-party platforms, giving customers flexibility in choosing their preferred privacy management solution.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **PII (Personally Identifiable Information)**: Data that can be used to identify an individual user.
- **DSR (Data Subject Request)**: A formal request made by an individual to exercise their data privacy rights.
- **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**: European Union privacy regulation.
- **CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)**: California's data privacy law.
- **API Key**: Authentication credential required to establish the integration with Amplitude.
- **Secret Key**: Secondary authentication credential required alongside the API Key for secure integration.
- **Data Store**: In the context of Osano, this refers to the configuration section where Amplitude connection details are specified.
- **Subject Rights Requests**: Formal requests from individuals to access, delete, or manage their personal data.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

These PII integrations fit into Amplitude's broader product ecosystem as compliance and privacy management solutions. They extend Amplitude's core analytics functionality by:

1. Enabling compliance with major privacy regulations without requiring manual processes.
2. Allowing organizations to maintain their analytics capabilities while respecting user privacy rights.
3. Providing an automated mechanism to handle data subject requests that would otherwise require custom development.

The integrations work by leveraging Amplitude's API infrastructure, suggesting that Amplitude provides specific API endpoints for PII management that these third-party platforms can access with proper authentication.

## Authentication and Setup

All three integrations require similar authentication methods:

- **API Key and Secret Key**: These credentials must be configured in the respective third-party platform to establish the connection with Amplitude.

For specific setup:

1. **DataGrail**: Requires configuration using Amplitude API key and Secret Key.
2. **Osano**: Requires configuration in the Data Stores section using API key and Secret Key. Note that this integration requires an Enterprise plan.
3. **Transcend**: Users are directed to contact Transcend's support team for integration assistance, suggesting a more hands-on setup process.

No specific API endpoints or command line invocations are explicitly mentioned in the documentation, though the integrations clearly leverage Amplitude's API infrastructure for their functionality.
