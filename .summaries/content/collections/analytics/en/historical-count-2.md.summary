# Summary
This documentation explains how Historical Count filters are applied last in Amplitude's order of operations, meaning they only count instances that match all other applied filters, while Event Historical Count filters are applied first, before other filters. It also clarifies how Historical Count works with custom events, where the custom event logic is considered before the Historical Count filter.
