Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that enables organizations to track, analyze, and understand user behavior across digital products. The platform provides both individual user-level and account-level analytics capabilities, with sophisticated instrumentation, visualization, and collaboration tools.

## Core Product Architecture

Amplitude Analytics operates on a multi-layered architecture centered around events, users, and groups. The platform supports both traditional user-centric analytics and account-level reporting through the Accounts add-on, which enables group-level analytics for B2B use cases. The system processes events through various APIs (HTTP V2, Batch API, Identify API) and SDKs (Android, iOS, JavaScript, Browser SDK), with data flowing through ingestion pipelines that support real-time processing and validation.

The platform's chart ecosystem forms the analytical foundation, with Event Segmentation serving as the primary analysis tool alongside specialized charts like Funnel Analysis, User Sessions, Retention Analysis, and Pathfinder. These charts integrate with behavioral cohorts, which segment users based on shared traits and actions within specific time periods, and can be enhanced with advanced features like Historical Count tracking and behavior offset analysis.

## Key Features and Capabilities

**Analytics and Visualization**: The platform offers comprehensive chart types including Event Segmentation for trend analysis, Funnel Analysis for conversion tracking, Retention Analysis for user lifecycle understanding, and specialized tools like Journeys (Pathfinder) for user path exploration. Charts support advanced filtering, segmentation, and can be enhanced with machine learning-powered Anomaly + Forecast detection using Prophet algorithms.

**Account-Level Reporting**: The Accounts add-on enables group-level analytics with support for up to 5 group types per project. This includes event-level and user-level group associations, dynamic group properties through Salesforce integration, and specialized behavioral cohorts for account analysis. Group Identify API enables real-time group property updates with operations like $set, $setOnce, $add, $append, and $unset.

**Collaboration and Sharing**: Amplitude provides extensive collaboration features through Spaces for team organization, Dashboards for metric aggregation, and Notebooks for analytical storytelling. The platform supports external sharing via public links and embed codes, with integrations to Slack, Confluence, Jira, Notion, Miro, and Google Workspace for seamless workflow integration.

**Data Quality and Debugging**: The platform includes comprehensive debugging tools like the Ingestion Debugger for monitoring event flow, User Lookup for individual user analysis, and the Chrome Instrumentation Explorer extension for Browser SDK validation. These tools help ensure data quality and proper instrumentation implementation.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events and Properties**: Events represent user actions tracked in the system, with event properties providing additional context. User properties describe user characteristics, while group properties (in account-level reporting) describe account or organization attributes.

**Cohorts**: Behavioral cohorts group users based on shared actions within time periods, while static cohorts contain predefined user lists. Cohorts support complex definitions with temporal parameters (during, since, within) and logical operators (and/or clauses).

**Groups and Group Types**: In account-level reporting, group types define categories of accounts (e.g., "company", "team"), while group values represent specific instances within those types. Groups can be associated at the event level or user level.

**Sessions**: Amplitude defines sessions as periods of user activity, with configurable timeout periods. Session-based metrics include entries, exits, totals, and duration calculations for marketing analytics.

**Historical Count**: A specialized filter that tracks the Nth instance (up to 5th) of user actions with a one-year lookback period, enabling analysis of user behavior patterns over time.

**Attribution Models**: Marketing analytics supports first-touch and last-touch attribution models for crediting marketing channels with conversion events, using configurable lookback windows.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Analytics integrates extensively with the broader product ecosystem through multiple touchpoints. The platform connects with marketing tools through UTM parameter tracking and channel classifiers, supporting out-of-the-box marketing analytics with metrics like CAC, ROAS, CTR, and CPC. 

Development workflows are supported through Releases tracking with semantic versioning, integration with feature flag systems, and A/B testing capabilities. The platform's API ecosystem enables custom integrations through REST APIs, with specialized endpoints like the Dashboard REST API for external data access.

Data governance is maintained through Amplitude Data integration for tracking plan management, with notifications for schema changes and validation workflows. The platform supports enterprise requirements through domain proxy configurations, BAA compliance options, and comprehensive admin controls.

## API Endpoints and Technical Integration

Key API endpoints include:
- **HTTP V2 API**: Primary event ingestion endpoint (api2.amplitude.com)
- **Batch API**: Bulk event processing
- **Identify API**: User property updates with groups key support
- **Group Identify API**: Account-level property management
- **Dashboard REST API**: External dashboard and chart data access
- **Releases API**: Programmatic release tracking

The platform supports domain proxy configurations for routing events through custom domains, with NGINX configuration examples and SDK endpoint customization options across all supported SDKs.

Session Replay functionality provides qualitative analysis through synchronized video recordings of user sessions, with 90-day retention and integration across multiple chart types. The feature supports web applications with limitations on canvas elements and mobile native apps.

Advanced features like Ask Amplitude provide conversational AI interfaces using OpenAI's LLM API for natural language chart creation and data exploration, while maintaining specific data sharing policies for enterprise compliance.
