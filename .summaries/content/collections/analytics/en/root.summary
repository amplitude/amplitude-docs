# Amplitude Analytics Platform

Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that enables businesses to track, analyze, and derive insights from user behavior data across digital products. The platform combines quantitative and qualitative analytics capabilities to help teams understand how users interact with their products and make data-driven decisions.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Analytics Capabilities

1. **Charts and Visualizations**: Amplitude offers various chart types for analyzing user behavior, including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, and Pathfinder.

2. **Behavioral Cohorts**: Groups of users defined by specific actions taken within a time period, allowing segmentation in analytics charts to analyze how product engagement affects business outcomes.

3. **Account-Level Reporting**: Enables analysis at the group level (accounts, teams, organizations) rather than individual users, particularly valuable for B2B companies to understand how specific accounts interact with their products.

4. **Anomaly Detection and Forecasting**: Identifies statistically significant deviations in metrics based on historical data using the Prophet forecasting methodology with three modes (agile, robust, custom) and configurable confidence intervals.

5. **Session Replay**: A qualitative analytics feature that records and plays back user sessions to provide visual context to quantitative data, helping teams understand user behavior, troubleshoot issues, and improve conversions.

6. **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**: Helps identify why anomalies occur in Event Segmentation charts by analyzing event properties, comparing them to baselines, and providing contextual information.

7. **Marketing Analytics**: Tracks and analyzes marketing data through sessions, channel classifiers, and attribution models, with support for first-touch and last-touch attribution across user journeys.

8. **Out-of-the-Box Analytics**: Pre-configured dashboards for marketing and product analytics with industry-standard KPIs and metrics.

### Collaboration and Sharing

1. **Dashboards**: Collections of charts that can be shared, subscribed to, filtered, and customized with different visualization modes.

2. **Notebooks**: Collaborative documents that combine text, media, charts, and metrics to explain insights and provide context to teammates.

3. **Spaces**: Collaborative areas for organizing and sharing content with specific team members, with hierarchical permission systems.

4. **Templates**: Reusable dashboard configurations that allow teams to efficiently recreate common analyses with customizable parameters.

5. **Breadcrumbs**: Tracks and organizes analysis steps, allowing users to document their analytical journey with notes and easily convert charts into shareable Notebooks.

6. **External Sharing**: Options to share content with external stakeholders through public links and embed codes, with password protection and expiration dates.

7. **Integrations**: Connections with tools like Slack, Miro, Google Drive, Notion, and Atlassian products for seamless workflow integration.

### User and Data Management

1. **User Profiles**: Detailed views of individual user data, including properties, event streams, session replays, cohort membership, and experiment participation.

2. **Historical Count**: Tracks user behavior for different instances of specific actions, helping identify differences in conversion and retention rates.

3. **Releases**: Tracks product changes as markers on time-series charts, allowing teams to analyze user response to product updates.

4. **Microscope**: Allows detailed inspection of specific data points in charts, providing options to view user streams, show user paths, create cohorts, and launch session replays.

5. **Ask Amplitude**: A conversational interface that allows users to create charts, search content, answer questions, and navigate Amplitude using natural language.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

### Data Collection and Instrumentation

1. **SDKs and APIs**: Amplitude provides SDKs for various platforms (Android, iOS, JavaScript) and APIs (Identify API, HTTP API, Group Identify API) for data collection.

2. **Domain Proxy**: Organizations can set up a domain proxy to relay events to Amplitude, providing more control over data sent by routing requests through their own domain.

3. **Instrumentation Planning**: Guidelines for implementing group-level analytics through event-level groups (temporary associations) and user-level groups (permanent associations).

4. **Debugging Tools**: Ingestion Debugger for monitoring requests, User Lookup for examining event streams, and Instrumentation Explorer Chrome extension for debugging Browser SDK implementations.

### Product Tiers and Licensing

1. **Plan Levels**: Features are available across different plan tiers:
   - Plus: Basic features with some limitations (e.g., limited to five behavioral cohorts)
   - Growth: More advanced features like Templates, Session Replay, and Root Cause Analysis
   - Enterprise: Full feature set with maximum capabilities

2. **Add-ons**: Certain features like the Accounts add-on (for group-level reporting) are available as additional purchases.

### Integration Ecosystem

1. **Third-Party Integrations**:
   - Slack: For notifications, chart previews, and Team Spaces connections
   - Atlassian: Smart Links for embedding chart previews in Confluence, Jira, and Trello
   - Miro: For adding Amplitude charts directly to Miro boards
   - Google Drive: Sync to export chart data to Google Sheets and images to Google Slides
   - Notion: Embedding Amplitude charts in Notion documents

2. **Data Platform Connections**:
   - Segment integration for account-level reporting
   - Salesforce integration for B2B analytics

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Events**: User actions tracked in Amplitude (e.g., page views, button clicks, purchases)

2. **Properties**: Additional metadata attached to events or users that provide context

3. **Cohorts**: Groups of users defined by specific criteria, either static (fixed list) or behavioral (based on actions)

4. **Groups**: Collections of users that represent higher-level entities like accounts, organizations, or teams

5. **Sessions**: Periods of continuous user activity, used for metrics like bounce rate and session duration

6. **Attribution Models**: Methods for assigning credit for conversions to marketing channels:
   - First-touch: Credits the first channel a user interacted with
   - Last-touch: Credits the most recent channel before conversion

7. **UTM Parameters**: Tracking parameters added to URLs for marketing campaign attribution

8. **Microscope**: Feature for drilling down into specific data points on charts

9. **Spaces**: Organizational units for content management and collaboration

10. **Templates**: Reusable dashboard configurations with customizable parameters

## API Endpoints and Technical Details

1. **HTTP V2 API**: Used for sending events to Amplitude, can be accessed directly or through a domain proxy

2. **Identify API**: Used for updating user properties without sending events

3. **Group Identify API**: Used for updating group properties

4. **Dashboard REST API**: Used by integrations like Google Drive Sync to export chart data

5. **Domain Proxy Configuration**: Example NGINX configuration for proxying requests to api2.amplitude.com

## Command Line Invocations

While not explicitly mentioned in the documentation, the platform appears to be primarily web-based with API access rather than command-line focused.

The platform emphasizes a user-friendly interface with natural language capabilities (Ask Amplitude) and visual analytics tools rather than command-line operations.
