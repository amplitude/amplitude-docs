Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that enables organizations to track, analyze, and understand user behavior across digital products. The platform provides sophisticated event-based analytics with advanced segmentation, cohort analysis, and collaborative features designed for data-driven product teams.

## Core Product Architecture

Amplitude Analytics operates on an event-driven architecture where user interactions are tracked as discrete events with associated properties. The platform supports both individual user-level analytics and group-level analytics through the Accounts add-on, enabling analysis at organizational or account levels. The system processes events through multiple APIs (HTTP V2, Batch, Identify, Group Identify) and integrates with popular tools like Segment and Salesforce.

The platform's chart ecosystem includes Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Pathfinder, Journeys, and specialized charts like Stickiness over Time and Conversion over Time. These charts can be organized into dashboards, shared externally, and embedded in third-party applications.

## Key Features and Capabilities

**Advanced Analytics Engine**: The platform leverages Prophet-based machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection and forecasting through the Anomaly + Forecast feature. Root Cause Analysis (RCA) automatically investigates anomalous data points by analyzing event properties against baselines.

**Cohort Management**: Amplitude provides sophisticated behavioral cohort capabilities, allowing users to segment audiences based on shared traits and actions within specific time periods. Cohorts can be created through Microscope, CSV imports, or inline within charts, with support for complex temporal parameters (during, since, within) and logical operators.

**Session Replay Integration**: For web applications, Session Replay provides qualitative user session recordings synchronized with event streams, accessible through charts, User Lookup, or dashboard widgets with 90-day retention.

**Collaborative Analytics**: The platform emphasizes collaboration through Spaces for team organization, Notebooks for analytical reporting with mixed content, and comprehensive sharing capabilities including public links, embed codes, and dashboard subscriptions.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Behavioral Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments based on shared behaviors and traits within specific time periods, limited to five cohorts for Plus users and supporting complex event-based conditions.

**Group Types and Values**: Core components of account-level reporting where group types represent categories (e.g., "company") and group values represent specific instances (e.g., "Amplitude Inc"), with a limit of five group types per project.

**Historical Count**: A specialized filter tracking the Nth instance (up to 5th) of user actions with a one-year lookback period, supporting specific operators (=, ≠, <, ≤, >, ≥).

**Microscope**: A data inspection tool enabling detailed analysis of chart data points through hover/click interactions, providing access to user streams, path analysis, and cohort creation.

**Channel Classifiers**: Sequential rule-based systems for marketing analytics that determine marketing channels for individual events using UTM parameters and referrer values.

**Dynamic Group Properties**: Real-time updating properties for account-level analytics that reflect current group states, contrasting with static event-level properties.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Analytics integrates extensively with external platforms and tools. The Atlassian Smart Links integration enables chart previews in Confluence and Jira, while Google Drive Sync exports chart data to Google Sheets and images to Google Slides. Slack integration provides chart link unfurling, comment notifications, and team space updates.

The platform supports domain proxy configurations for organizations requiring event routing through custom domains instead of direct api2.amplitude.com connections. Marketing analytics capabilities include out-of-the-box metrics based on `[Amplitude] Page Viewed` events and comprehensive UTM parameter tracking.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

Key API endpoints include:
- **HTTP V2 API**: Primary event ingestion endpoint (api2.amplitude.com)
- **Batch API**: Bulk event processing
- **Identify API**: User property updates with groups key support
- **Group Identify API**: Account-level property management
- **Dashboard REST API**: Powers Google Drive integration and external data access
- **Releases API**: Automated release tracking and management

The platform provides debugging tools including the Ingestion Debugger for monitoring requests and events, User Lookup for analyzing event streams, and the Chrome Instrumentation Explorer extension for Browser SDK debugging.

## Advanced Features and Limitations

**Plan-Based Feature Distribution**: Features are tiered across Starter, Plus, Growth, and Enterprise plans, with advanced capabilities like account-level reporting, anomaly detection, and enhanced collaboration controls available on higher tiers.

**Data Governance**: The platform includes comprehensive permission systems with space-level, project-level, and content-specific access controls. Content can be marked as discoverable/unlisted, official (Enterprise), or templated for reuse.

**AI Integration**: Ask Amplitude provides conversational AI interface using Amazon Bedrock LLM API for natural language chart creation and navigation, with specific data sharing policies for chart metadata and aggregated results.

The platform maintains specific limitations including 50MB file limits for cohort imports, 1000 property limits for account-level reporting, 90-day retention for Session Replay, and various chart-specific restrictions for features like Historical Count and custom formulas.
