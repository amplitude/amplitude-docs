# Amplitude Analytics Platform

Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that helps businesses understand user behavior, track product performance, and make data-driven decisions. The platform combines quantitative and qualitative analytics capabilities to provide insights into how users interact with digital products.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Analytics Capabilities

1. **Charts and Visualizations**: Amplitude offers various chart types for analyzing user behavior, including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, Pathfinder, and more.

2. **Behavioral Cohorts**: Groups of users defined by specific actions taken within a time period, allowing segmentation in analytics charts to analyze how product engagement affects business outcomes.

3. **Account-Level Reporting**: Enables analysis at the group level (accounts, teams, organizations) rather than individual users, particularly valuable for B2B companies to understand how specific accounts interact with their product.

4. **Anomaly Detection and Forecasting**: Identifies statistically significant deviations in metrics based on historical data using the Prophet forecasting methodology with three modes (agile, robust, custom) and configurable confidence intervals.

5. **Session Replay**: A qualitative analytics feature that records user sessions to provide visual context to quantitative data, helping troubleshoot issues and improve conversions.

6. **Ask Amplitude**: A conversational interface that allows users to create charts, search content, answer questions, and navigate Amplitude using natural language, leveraging OpenAI's LLM.

7. **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**: Helps identify why anomalies occur in Event Segmentation charts by analyzing event properties, comparing them to baselines, and providing contextual information.

8. **Marketing Analytics**: Tracks and analyzes marketing data through sessions, channel classifiers, and attribution models to understand campaign performance.

9. **Out-of-the-Box Analytics**: Pre-configured dashboards for marketing and product analytics with industry-standard KPIs and metrics.

### Collaboration and Sharing

1. **Spaces**: Collaborative workspaces where teams can organize and share analytics content with configurable permissions.

2. **Dashboards**: Collections of charts and other content that can be shared, subscribed to, filtered, and customized with various visualization options.

3. **Notebooks**: Collaborative documents that combine text, media, charts, and metrics to explain insights and provide context to teammates.

4. **Templates**: Reusable dashboard configurations that allow teams to efficiently recreate common analyses with customizable parameters.

5. **Breadcrumbs**: Tracks and organizes analysis steps, allowing users to document their analytical journey with notes and charts.

6. **External Sharing**: Options to share content with stakeholders outside the organization through public links and embed codes.

7. **Integrations**: Connections with tools like Slack, Miro, Google Drive, Atlassian products, and Notion for seamless workflow integration.

### Data Management and Debugging

1. **User Profiles**: Search for and analyze individual user data, including properties, event streams, session replays, and cohort membership.

2. **Ingestion Debugger**: Monitors requests and throttled users to validate data collection.

3. **Instrumentation Explorer**: Chrome extension for debugging Browser SDK implementations.

4. **Domain Proxy**: Allows organizations to relay events to Amplitude through their own domain for more control over data.

## Product Relationships and Ecosystem

Amplitude Analytics is part of a broader product ecosystem that includes:

1. **Amplitude Data**: Referenced in the Slack integration documentation, suggesting it's a separate but related product for data management.

2. **Amplitude Experiment**: Mentioned in the Microscope documentation as a target for launching experiments from chart data points.

3. **Feature Flags**: Referenced in User Profiles documentation, indicating integration with feature flag management.

The platform is available in different tiers:
- **Plus Plan**: Basic features with some limitations (e.g., limited to five behavioral cohorts)
- **Growth Plan**: More advanced features like Templates, Session Replay, and Root Cause Analysis
- **Enterprise Plan**: Full feature set with maximum capabilities

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Events**: User actions tracked in Amplitude (e.g., page views, button clicks, purchases)
2. **Properties**: Additional data points attached to events or users
3. **Cohorts**: Groups of users defined by specific behaviors or characteristics
4. **Group Types**: Categories for organizing users into higher-level entities (accounts, organizations)
5. **Microscope**: Feature for analyzing specific data points in charts
6. **Historical Count**: Feature for tracking user behavior for different instances of specific actions
7. **Releases**: Markers on time-series charts that track product changes
8. **Workspace**: Personal space for users to access their saved analyses and draft content

## API Endpoints and Technical Integration

1. **HTTP V2 API**: Used for sending events to Amplitude (`api2.amplitude.com`)
2. **Identify API**: Used for updating user properties
3. **Group Identify API**: Used for updating group properties
4. **Dashboard REST API**: Used for exporting chart data to Google Sheets

SDK implementations are available for various platforms:
- Android
- iOS
- JavaScript
- Server-side SDKs

For domain proxy setup, the configuration involves routing requests through an organization's own domain to Amplitude's API endpoints using NGINX with `proxy_pass` directives.

The platform supports integration with third-party tools like Segment for data collection and Salesforce for B2B analytics.
