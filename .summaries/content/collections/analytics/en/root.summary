## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Analytics Concepts
- **Event**: A discrete user action tracked in Amplitude
- **User Property**: Attributes associated with individual users
- **Group Property**: Attributes associated with groups of users (accounts, organizations)
- **Cohort**: A collection of users who share common characteristics or behaviors
- **Session**: A period of continuous user activity, defined by configurable timeout settings
- **Microscope**: Feature for analyzing specific data points in charts

### Group Analytics Terminology
- **Event-Level Groups**: Temporary associations between users and groups for specific events
- **User-Level Groups**: Permanent associations between users and groups
- **Group Types**: Categories of groups (e.g., accounts, organizations, teams)
- **Group Identify API**: Method for creating and updating group properties

### Chart and Analysis Types
- **Event Segmentation**: Analysis of specific events and their properties
- **Funnel Analysis**: Tracking user progression through a sequence of events
- **Retention Analysis**: Measuring continued user engagement over time
- **Pathfinder**: Visualizing user navigation paths through a product
- **Historical Count**: Tracking specific instances (1st, 2nd, etc.) of user actions

## Integration with Broader Ecosystem

Amplitude Analytics integrates with various other tools and platforms:

### Amplitude Product Suite
- **Amplitude Experiment**: A/B testing and feature flagging
- **Amplitude CDP**: Customer data platform capabilities
- **Amplitude Data**: Tracking plan and data governance

### Third-Party Integrations
- **Collaboration Tools**: Slack, Miro, Notion, Atlassian products, Google Drive

- **Marketing Platforms**: Various attribution integrations

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

### Key APIs
- **HTTP V2 API**: `https://api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi` for sending events
- **Identify API**: `https://api2.amplitude.com/identify` for updating user properties
- **Group Identify API**: For creating and updating group properties

### SDK Implementation Examples
- JavaScript: `amplitude.getInstance().logEvent("event_name", {property: "value"})`
- iOS: `Amplitude.instance().logEvent("event_name", withEventProperties: ["property": "value"])`
- Android: `Amplitude.getInstance().logEvent("event_name", JSONObject properties)`

### Domain Proxy Configuration
Users can configure a domain proxy to relay events through their own domain:
```
location /amplitude/ {
    proxy_pass https://api2.amplitude.com/;
    proxy_set_header Host api2.amplitude.com;
}
```

## Feature-Specific Capabilities

### Behavioral Cohorts
- Create cohorts based on user actions within specific time periods
- Apply cohorts as segments in charts
- Track cohort population changes over time
- Compare metrics between different cohorts

### Account-Level Reporting
- Analyze metrics at the group level rather than individual users
- Create and update group properties
- Define multiple group types for different organizational structures
- Perform group-level analyses for B2B use cases

### Anomaly Detection and Forecasting
- Identify statistically significant deviations in metrics
- Project future trends based on historical patterns
- Configure sensitivity levels (95%, 98%, or 99% confidence intervals)
- Set up automated alerts for anomalies

### Session Replay
- View recorded user sessions with synchronized event streams
- Filter replays by user properties or behaviors
- Troubleshoot issues and understand user experience
- Integrate with quantitative analytics for context
