Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that enables organizations to track, analyze, and understand user behavior through event-based data collection and sophisticated analytical tools. The platform provides both individual user-level and account-level reporting capabilities, with advanced features for cohort analysis, anomaly detection, and collaborative analytics workflows.

## Core Product Architecture and Features

### Analytics Foundation
The platform centers around **Event Segmentation** as its primary analytical engine, supported by specialized chart types including **Funnel Analysis**, **Retention Analysis**, **User Sessions**, **Pathfinder**, and **Journeys**. These charts work together to provide comprehensive user behavior insights through time-series analysis, conversion tracking, and user journey mapping.

### Account-Level Reporting System
Amplitude's **Accounts add-on** enables group-level analytics through a sophisticated instrumentation system supporting up to 5 group types per project. This system distinguishes between **event-level groups** (associated with specific events) and **user-level groups** (associated with user profiles), implemented through the **Group Identify API**, **HTTP V2 API**, and **Batch API**. The system supports dynamic group properties (up to 1000 per group type) and integrates with external platforms like Salesforce and Segment.

### Behavioral Cohorts and Segmentation
The platform's **behavioral cohorts** feature enables sophisticated user segmentation based on event frequency, temporal parameters (**during**, **since**, **within**), and complex logical operators. The system supports **Historical Count** tracking for Nth instance analysis (up to 5th occurrence) with a one-year lookback period, and includes advanced features like **behavior offset** for cross-period analysis and **inline cohorts** for real-time segmentation within chart workflows.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Core Analytics Concepts
- **Event Segmentation**: Primary chart type for analyzing event volumes and user behavior over time
- **Funnel Analysis**: Conversion tracking through sequential event steps
- **Retention Analysis**: User return behavior measurement with calendar alignment options
- **Microscope**: Interactive data exploration tool for drilling into chart data points
- **Pathfinder**: User journey visualization (with **Pathfinder Users** for detailed user flows)

### Data Organization and Collaboration
- **Spaces**: Collaborative workspaces with permission controls (**can edit**, **can add**, **can view**)
- **Dashboards**: Collections of charts with template capabilities and subscription features
- **Notebooks**: Mixed-content analytical reports combining charts, text, and metrics
- **Breadcrumbs**: Analysis tracking system for workflow documentation

### Advanced Analytics Features
- **Anomaly + Forecast**: Prophet-based machine learning for statistical anomaly detection
- **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**: Automated investigation of anomalous data points
- **Ask Amplitude**: Conversational AI interface using OpenAI's LLM for natural language analytics
- **Session Replay**: Qualitative user session recordings synchronized with event streams

## API Endpoints and Technical Integration

### Core APIs
- **HTTP V2 API**: Primary event ingestion endpoint (api2.amplitude.com)
- **Batch API**: Bulk event processing
- **Identify API**: User property management with `groups` key for account-level reporting
- **Group Identify API**: Group property operations (`$set`, `$setOnce`, `$add`, `$append`, `$unset`)
- **Dashboard REST API**: Programmatic dashboard and chart access

### SDK Integration
The platform supports multiple SDKs (Android, iOS, JavaScript, Browser SDK) with configurable endpoints through `serverUrl`, `apiEndpoint`, and `setServerUrl` functions. The **Chrome Instrumentation Explorer** extension provides debugging capabilities for Browser SDK implementations.

### Domain Proxy Configuration
Organizations can implement domain proxy services using NGINX `proxy_pass` configuration to relay events through custom domains instead of direct api2.amplitude.com communication.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

### External Platform Integrations
- **Slack Integration**: Link unfurling, comment notifications, team space connections, and Amplitude Data project notifications
- **Google Workspace**: Sync to Drive and Sheets extension for chart data export and image sharing
- **Atlassian Smart Links**: Chart preview embedding in Confluence and Jira
- **Notion Integration**: Chart embedding through URL pasting with authentication flow
- **Miro Integration**: Chart embedding via Amplitude plug-in from Miro Marketplace

### Marketing Analytics Ecosystem
The **Out-of-the-box Marketing Analytics** feature provides centralized tracking through **Daily Ad Metrics** events and UTM parameter analysis (`utm_campaign`, `utm_content`, `utm_medium`, `utm_source`, `utm_term`). This includes **channel classifiers** for sequential rule-based marketing channel assignment and **attribution models** (first-touch and last-touch) for conversion analysis.

### Data Governance and Quality
The platform includes **Ingestion Debugger** for real-time event monitoring, **User Lookup** for individual user analysis, and **Taxonomy & Data QA** validation. The **Insights** feature provides automated anomaly detection with configurable confidence intervals and training periods.

## Plan-Based Feature Distribution

Features are distributed across **Starter**, **Plus**, **Growth**, and **Enterprise** plans, with advanced capabilities like account-level reporting, anomaly detection, and external sharing restricted to higher tiers. The **Scholarship** plan provides academic access to core functionality, while specialized add-ons like **Accounts** and **Insights** extend platform capabilities for enterprise use cases.
