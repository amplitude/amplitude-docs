Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that enables organizations to track, analyze, and understand user behavior across digital products. The platform provides sophisticated event-based analytics with advanced segmentation, cohort analysis, and collaborative features designed for data-driven product teams.

## Core Product Architecture

Amplitude Analytics operates on an event-driven architecture where user interactions are captured as events with associated properties. The platform supports both individual user-level analysis and account-level reporting through the Accounts add-on, which enables group-level analytics for aggregated units like companies, teams, or other organizational structures. The system can handle up to five group types per project with a limit of 1,000 group properties.

The platform integrates with various data sources through multiple APIs including HTTP V2 API, Batch API, Identify API, and Group Identify API. It also supports integrations with Segment (both Actions and Classic), Salesforce, and provides SDK support for web and mobile applications. For web applications specifically, Amplitude offers autocapture functionality and Session Replay capabilities with 90-day retention.

## Key Features and Capabilities

**Chart Types and Analytics**: Amplitude provides multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Pathfinder, Journeys, and specialized charts like Conversion over Time and Stickiness over Time. Each chart type serves specific analytical purposes, from tracking user engagement to understanding conversion flows and retention patterns.

**Behavioral Cohorts**: The platform enables sophisticated user segmentation through behavioral cohorts, which group users based on shared traits and actions within specific time periods. Users can create cohorts using various methods including event counting (count, relative count, total sum of property, distinct values, historical count), temporal parameters (during, since, within), and logical operators. The system supports both static cohorts (imported via CSV) and dynamic behavioral cohorts that update automatically.

**Advanced Analytics Features**: Amplitude includes several advanced analytical capabilities:
- **Anomaly + Forecast**: Uses Prophet-based algorithms to detect statistical anomalies in time-series data with configurable confidence intervals
- **Historical Count**: Tracks the Nth instance (up to 5th) of user actions with a one-year lookback period
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Automatically investigates anomalous data points by analyzing event properties
- **Microscope**: Enables detailed inspection of chart data points with options for user stream analysis and cohort creation

## Collaboration and Content Management

**Spaces and Sharing**: Amplitude organizes content through spaces that enable team collaboration with granular permission controls (can edit/add/view). Users can share content across spaces using shortcuts, integrate with Slack for notifications, and manage content visibility through discoverable/unlisted settings.

**Dashboards and Templates**: The platform supports comprehensive dashboard creation with the ability to aggregate charts from multiple projects, add behavioral cohorts and Session Replays, and implement commenting systems. Dashboards can be converted into reusable templates with Find & Replace functionality for standardizing analyses across teams.

**External Integration**: Amplitude provides extensive external sharing capabilities including public links, embed codes, and integrations with tools like Notion, Confluence, Jira, Miro, and Google Workspace. The platform supports Atlassian Smart Links for embedding chart previews and offers a Google Drive sync extension for exporting data.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events and Properties**: Events represent user actions, while properties provide additional context. The platform distinguishes between event properties (specific to individual events) and user properties (persistent attributes associated with users).

**Groups and Accounts**: Group-level analytics through the Accounts add-on enables analysis of aggregated entities. Event-level groups associate events with group identifiers, while user-level groups associate users with groups through the Identify API.

**Sessions**: Amplitude defines sessions as periods of user activity, with configurable session definitions for web applications. Session-based metrics include entries, exits, and totals for marketing analytics.

**Attribution Models**: The platform supports first-touch and last-touch attribution models for marketing analytics, using channel classifiers that apply sequential rules to determine marketing channels.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Analytics integrates into a broader product ecosystem through several key touchpoints:

**Data Infrastructure**: The platform connects with existing data infrastructure through domain proxy configurations, allowing organizations to relay events through their own domains. It supports various authentication methods and provides debugging tools including the Ingestion Debugger and Chrome Instrumentation Explorer.

**Marketing Analytics**: Out-of-the-box marketing analytics provides pre-configured tracking for UTM parameters, ad performance metrics (CAC, ROAS, CTR, CPC), and page engagement analysis. The system automatically processes Daily Ad Metrics events and supports web experiment creation.

**Product Analytics**: The platform offers out-of-the-box product analytics views including Product Overview, Onboarding, Feature Engagement, and Retention analysis. These views provide pre-configured metrics for active users, retention intervals, and feature adoption tracking.

**AI and Automation**: Ask Amplitude provides a conversational AI interface using OpenAI's LLM API for natural language chart creation and navigation. The platform also includes automated insights through the Insights alerts feature using Prophet machine learning for anomaly detection.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

Key API endpoints include:
- HTTP V2 API for event ingestion
- Batch API for bulk data processing  
- Identify API for user property updates
- Group Identify API for account-level properties
- Dashboard REST API for data export
- Releases API for product change tracking

The platform supports various SDK configurations with options for custom serverUrl endpoints, apiEndpoint configuration, and setServerUrl functions across different programming languages and frameworks.

Amplitude Analytics operates across multiple pricing tiers (Starter, Plus, Growth, Enterprise) with feature availability varying by plan level, particularly for advanced features like account-level reporting, anomaly detection, and enhanced collaboration controls.
