- **Identify API**: For updating user properties
- **Group Identify API**: For creating and updating group properties

### Domain Proxy Configuration
Organizations can set up a domain proxy to relay events to Amplitude through their own domain:
```
location /amplitude/ {
    proxy_pass https://api2.amplitude.com/;
    proxy_set_header Host api2.amplitude.com;
}
```

### SDK Configuration Examples
When using a domain proxy, SDKs must be configured with the custom endpoint:
```javascript
// JavaScript SDK example
amplitude.init('API_KEY', null, {
    serverUrl: 'https://your-domain.com/amplitude/'
});
```

```java
// Android SDK example
Amplitude.getInstance()
    .setServerUrl("https://your-domain.com/amplitude/");
```

```swift
// iOS SDK example
Amplitude.instance().setServerUrl("https://your-domain.com/amplitude/");
```
