Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that enables organizations to track, analyze, and understand user behavior through event-based data collection and sophisticated analytical tools. The platform provides both individual user-level and account-level reporting capabilities, with advanced features for cohort analysis, anomaly detection, and collaborative analytics workflows.

## Core Product Architecture and Features

### Analytics Foundation
The platform centers around event-based analytics with multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, User Sessions, Retention Analysis, and Pathfinder for user journey mapping. The system supports both real-time and historical data analysis with configurable time windows and sophisticated filtering capabilities.

### Account-Level Reporting (Accounts Add-on)
A key enterprise feature that enables group-level analytics instead of individual user reporting. This system supports up to 5 group types per project and integrates with the Group Identify API for dynamic group properties. The feature includes Salesforce integration for automated group property synchronization and supports both event-level and user-level group associations.

### Behavioral Cohorts and Segmentation
The platform provides sophisticated user segmentation through behavioral cohorts that group users based on shared traits and actions within specific time periods. The system supports complex cohort definitions with event counting methods (count, relative count, total sum of property, distinct values, historical count), temporal parameters (during, since, within), and logical operators. Cohorts can be created through multiple methods including Microscope data point analysis, CSV imports, and inline creation within charts.

### Advanced Analytics Features
- **Anomaly + Forecast**: Uses Prophet-based algorithms for statistical anomaly detection across time-series data with configurable confidence intervals and training data durations
- **Historical Count**: Tracks the Nth instance (up to 5th) of user actions with one-year lookback capability
- **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**: Automatically investigates anomalous data points by analyzing event properties and comparing them to baselines
- **Microscope**: Enables drill-down analysis into specific data points for user stream inspection, cohort creation, and session replay access

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Core Analytics Terms
- **Event Segmentation**: Primary chart type for analyzing event frequency and properties over time
- **Funnel Analysis**: Conversion tracking through sequential user actions
- **Behavioral Cohorts**: Dynamic user groups based on shared behaviors and traits
- **Group Types/Values**: Account-level reporting entities for B2B analytics
- **Historical Count**: Tracking specific instances (1st, 2nd, etc.) of user actions
- **Session Replay**: Qualitative recordings of user web sessions synchronized with event streams

### API and Integration Components
- **Group Identify API**: Creates and updates group properties with operations ($set, $setOnce, $add, $append, $unset)
- **HTTP V2 API/Batch API**: Server-side event ingestion endpoints
- **Identify API**: User property management with groups key support
- **Dashboard REST API**: Powers external integrations and data exports

### Collaboration and Sharing Features
- **Spaces**: Team collaboration environments with permission management (can edit/add/view)
- **Notebooks**: Analytical reports combining charts, text, and metrics with markdown support
- **Templates**: Reusable dashboard configurations with Find & Replace functionality
- **Public Links/Embed Codes**: External sharing capabilities for stakeholders outside the organization

## Product Ecosystem Integration

### Data Collection and Instrumentation
The platform integrates with multiple SDKs (Android, iOS, JavaScript, Browser SDK) and supports server-side implementation through various APIs. The Chrome Instrumentation Explorer extension provides debugging capabilities for Browser SDK events. Domain proxy services enable event routing through custom domains instead of direct api2.amplitude.com connections.

### Third-Party Integrations
- **Segment**: Both Actions and Classic destinations with Group Type/Value Trait mapping
- **Salesforce**: Dynamic group properties synchronization for account-level reporting
- **Slack**: Link unfurling, comment notifications, and team space connections
- **Google Workspace**: Sync to Drive and Sheets extension for data export
- **Atlassian**: Smart Links for chart previews in Confluence and Jira
- **Notion**: Chart embedding through URL pasting
- **Miro**: Direct chart embedding via marketplace plug-in

### Marketing Analytics Capabilities
Out-of-the-box marketing analytics provides channel classification through sequential rule execution, attribution models (first-touch and last-touch), and UTM parameter tracking. The system includes Daily Ad Metrics events and supports metrics like CAC, ROAS, CTR, and CPC calculations.

## Key API Endpoints and Commands

### Primary APIs
- **HTTP V2 API**: `api2.amplitude.com` - Primary event ingestion endpoint
- **Group Identify API**: Group property management and updates
- **Identify API**: User property management with groups key support
- **Dashboard REST API**: Chart data export and external integration
- **Releases API**: Product change tracking and version management

### SDK Configuration
- **JavaScript**: `amplitude.init()` with serverUrl configuration
- **Browser SDK**: `setServerUrl()` function for custom endpoints
- **Domain Proxy**: NGINX `proxy_pass` configuration for event relay

### Data Management
- **Ingestion Debugger**: Real-time event monitoring and validation
- **User Lookup**: Individual user event stream analysis
- **Chart Cleanup**: Bulk chart management through organizational settings

The platform operates on a tiered plan structure (Scholarship, Plus, Growth, Enterprise) with feature availability varying by plan level, particularly for advanced features like Accounts add-on, Anomaly + Forecast, and enhanced collaboration controls.
