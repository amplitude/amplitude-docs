Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that enables organizations to track, analyze, and understand user behavior through event-based data collection and sophisticated analytical tools. The platform provides both quantitative analytics through various chart types and qualitative insights through features like Session Replay, with extensive collaboration and sharing capabilities.

## Core Product Architecture and Features

Amplitude Analytics operates on an event-driven architecture where user interactions are tracked as events with associated properties. The platform supports both individual user-level analytics and group-level analytics through the Accounts add-on, which enables account-level reporting for B2B use cases. The system can handle up to five group types per project with a limit of 1,000 account-level properties.

The platform offers multiple analytical chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Pathfinder, and Journeys charts. These charts can be organized into dashboards, which support templating functionality for reusable analytical frameworks. The system includes automated anomaly detection through the Anomaly + Forecast feature, which uses Prophet-based algorithms to identify statistically significant deviations in time-series data.

## Key Analytical Capabilities

**Behavioral Cohorts and Segmentation**: Users can create behavioral cohorts based on shared traits and actions within specific time periods, with support for complex conditions including event counting methods (count, relative count, total sum of property, distinct values, historical count), temporal parameters (during, since, within), and logical operators. The platform supports behavior offset functionality for analyzing user behaviors across two distinct time periods.

**Historical Count Analysis**: The platform provides Historical Count filters for tracking the Nth instance (up to 5th) of user actions with a one-year lookback period, supporting various operators (=, ≠, <, ≤, >, ≥) across Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Pathfinder, and Retention Analysis charts.

**Marketing Analytics**: Amplitude includes comprehensive marketing analytics capabilities with channel classifiers that apply sequential rules to determine marketing channels, attribution models (first-touch and last-touch), and out-of-the-box marketing analytics providing centralized tracking of page engagement and session-based metrics through UTM parameter configuration.

## Data Investigation and Quality Tools

**Microscope Feature**: Enables detailed inspection of chart data points through hover/click interactions, providing access to user streams, user paths, cohort creation, session replay integration, and conversion driver analysis for funnel charts.

**Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**: Available on Growth and Enterprise plans, this feature investigates anomalous data points by analyzing event properties in batches of thirty and generating time-series graphs comparing anomalous events to baseline data.

**Debugging Tools**: The platform includes the Ingestion Debugger for monitoring requests/events/throttled users, User Lookup for analyzing event streams in user profiles, and the Chrome Instrumentation Explorer extension for debugging Browser SDK events.

## Collaboration and Content Management

**Spaces and Permissions**: Amplitude uses a spaces-based collaboration model with member permissions (can edit/add/view) and Slack channel integration for notifications. Project-level permissions override space-level permissions in the hierarchy.

**Content Organization**: The platform supports dashboards, notebooks for analytical reports with mixed content, and templates for reusable analytical frameworks. Content can be shared externally through public links and embed codes, with password protection and expiration settings.

**Search and Discovery**: A comprehensive search feature enables finding charts, dashboards, cohorts, and notebooks with real-time results and filtering options including archived content, official content, templates, space, type, editor, project, and last edited date.

## Integration Ecosystem

**Third-Party Integrations**: Amplitude integrates with numerous external platforms including Slack for notifications and chart unfurling, Atlassian Smart Links for embedding chart previews in Confluence and Jira, Notion for chart embedding, Miro for collaborative analysis, and Google Drive/Sheets for data export.

**API and SDK Support**: The platform supports multiple instrumentation methods including various SDKs, Identify API, HTTP API, Group Identify API, and Segment integration. Domain proxy services can relay events through custom domains instead of directly to api2.amplitude.com.

**AI and Automation**: Ask Amplitude provides a conversational AI interface using Amazon Bedrock LLM API for natural language chart creation and navigation. The Amplitude Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server enables conversational AI analysis through integrations with Claude, Cursor, and Gemini CLI.

## Key API Endpoints and Technical Components

- **HTTP V2 API and Batch API**: For event ingestion and group-level analytics
- **Group Identify API**: For managing group properties and associations
- **Releases API**: For tracking product changes and version adoption
- **Dashboard REST API**: Used by Google Workspace extension for data export
- **MCP Server endpoint**: `https://mcp.amplitude.com/v1/mcp` for conversational AI integration

## Plan-Based Feature Availability

The platform operates on a tiered plan structure (Starter, Plus, Growth, Enterprise) with feature restrictions:
- **Starter**: 50 dashboard limit
- **Plus**: 5 cohort limit, manual release creation
- **Growth/Enterprise**: Enhanced controls, automated release detection, advanced features like RCA and Insights
- **Enterprise**: Official dashboard designation, advanced permissions

## Data Retention and Limitations

Session Replay has a 90-day default retention period and is limited to web applications, excluding canvas/WebGL elements. The platform supports various file formats for imports with specific limitations (50MB for CSV cohort imports, BMP image format limitations in Notebooks). Historical Count analysis is limited to a one-year lookback period, and certain chart types (Personas, Pathfinder Users) have restrictions in specific contexts like Notebooks or external sharing.
