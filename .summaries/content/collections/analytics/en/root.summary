Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that enables organizations to track, analyze, and understand user behavior across digital products. The platform provides sophisticated event-based analytics with advanced segmentation, cohort analysis, and collaborative features designed for data-driven product teams.

## Core Product Architecture

Amplitude Analytics operates on an event-driven architecture where user interactions are tracked as discrete events with associated properties. The platform supports multiple data ingestion methods including client-side SDKs (Android, iOS, JavaScript), server-side APIs (HTTP V2 API, Batch API, Identify API), and third-party integrations like Segment. Events flow through api2.amplitude.com by default, though organizations can implement domain proxy configurations using NGINX to route data through their own infrastructure.

The platform's data model centers around users, events, and groups, with sophisticated instrumentation capabilities for both individual user tracking and account-level reporting through the Accounts add-on. Group-level analytics support up to 5 group types per project with 1000 property limits, enabling B2B companies to analyze behavior at the account, organization, or custom entity level.

## Chart Types and Analytics Capabilities

Amplitude provides a comprehensive suite of visualization and analysis tools:

**Core Chart Types:**
- Event Segmentation charts for measuring event frequency and user engagement
- Funnel Analysis for conversion tracking and drop-off analysis
- Retention Analysis for measuring user return behavior over time
- User Sessions analytics for session-based metrics
- Pathfinder for user journey mapping
- Stickiness analysis for measuring user engagement frequency

**Advanced Features:**
- Microscope functionality for drilling into individual data points and user streams
- Historical Count tracking for analyzing the Nth instance (up to 5th) of user actions with one-year lookback
- Anomaly + Forecast using Prophet-based algorithms for detecting statistical deviations
- Root Cause Analysis (RCA) for investigating anomalous data points
- Session Replay integration for qualitative analysis of user sessions

## Cohort System and User Segmentation

Amplitude's cohort system enables sophisticated user segmentation through multiple creation methods:

**Cohort Types:**
- Behavioral cohorts based on user actions and properties within specific time periods
- Static cohorts imported via CSV files containing user IDs or Amplitude IDs
- Inline cohorts created directly within chart analysis workflows
- Group-level cohorts for account-based analysis

**Cohort Definition Parameters:**
- Event-based conditions (count, relative count, total sum of property, distinct values, historical count, count in interval)
- Temporal parameters (during, since, within)
- User property conditions (most recently, any time)
- Logical operators (and/or clauses)
- Behavior offset for comparing actions across distinct time periods

## Collaboration and Content Management

The platform emphasizes team collaboration through several organizational features:

**Spaces System:** Project-level collaboration with member permission management (can edit/add/view), content shortcuts for multi-space sharing, and Slack integration for team notifications.

**Dashboard Ecosystem:** Comprehensive dashboard creation with chart aggregation, behavioral cohort integration, Session Replay embedding, commenting functionality, and template creation capabilities. Dashboard subscriptions enable automated HTML email reports with CSV attachments or Slack notifications.

**Content Sharing:** External sharing through public links and embed codes, with password protection and expiration settings. Integration with collaboration tools including Atlassian Smart Links for Confluence/Jira, Notion embedding, and Miro board integration.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events and Properties:**
- Events: Discrete user actions tracked with timestamps and metadata
- Event Properties: Attributes describing specific event instances
- User Properties: Persistent attributes associated with user profiles
- Group Properties: Attributes associated with account-level entities

**Attribution and Marketing Analytics:**
- Channel Classifiers: Sequential rules determining marketing channels for events
- First-touch/Last-touch Attribution: Models crediting marketing channels for conversions
- UTM Parameters: Campaign tracking parameters (utm_campaign, utm_content, utm_medium, utm_source, utm_term)
- Daily Ad Metrics: Automated event tracking for advertising performance

**Time-based Analysis:**
- Rolling Windows: Dynamic time periods for cohort analysis
- Conversion Windows: Time limits for funnel step completion
- Retention Intervals: Periods for measuring user return behavior
- Behavior Offset: Time period comparisons for user action analysis

## API Endpoints and Integration Methods

**Core APIs:**
- HTTP V2 API: Primary event ingestion endpoint
- Batch API: Bulk event processing
- Identify API: User property updates with `groups` key for account-level reporting
- Group Identify API: Account/group property management with operations ($set, $setOnce, $add, $append, $unset)
- Dashboard REST API: Programmatic dashboard and chart access

**SDK Configuration:**
- `serverUrl` configuration for domain proxy setups
- `apiEndpoint` options for custom routing
- `setServerUrl` function for runtime endpoint modification

## Advanced Features and Add-ons

**Accounts Add-on:** Enables group-level analytics with account-level reporting, group-level behavioral cohorts, funnel analysis, and Microscope integration. Supports dynamic group properties and Salesforce integration.

**Insights Add-on:** Provides automated anomaly detection using Prophet machine learning, with configurable confidence intervals and alert notifications through Slack integration.

**Out-of-the-box Analytics:** Pre-built views for Marketing Analytics (Traffic by Channel, Ad Performance, Page Engagement) and Product Analytics (Product Overview, Onboarding, Feature Engagement, Retention) with configurable metrics and Feature Flags integration.

## Plan-based Feature Distribution

Features are distributed across Scholarship, Plus, Growth, and Enterprise plans, with advanced capabilities like account-level reporting, anomaly detection, external sharing, and enhanced collaboration controls typically requiring Growth or Enterprise subscriptions. The platform maintains specific limitations such as 5 cohorts for Plus users, 50MB file limits for CSV imports, and 90-day retention for Session Replay data.

The platform integrates extensively with external tools including Google Workspace (Drive and Sheets sync), Slack, Segment, Salesforce, and various embedding platforms, making it a central hub for product analytics within broader organizational toolchains.
