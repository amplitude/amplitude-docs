Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that enables organizations to track, analyze, and understand user behavior through event-based data collection and sophisticated reporting capabilities. The platform provides both individual user-level and account-level analytics, with advanced features for cohort analysis, anomaly detection, and collaborative data exploration.

## Core Product Architecture and Features

**Analytics Foundation**: The platform centers around event-based tracking with support for both user-level and account-level reporting through the Accounts add-on. Users can instrument data collection via multiple methods including Amplitude SDKs, HTTP V2 API, Batch API, Identify API, and third-party integrations like Segment and Salesforce.

**Chart Types and Visualization**: Amplitude offers multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Pathfinder, Journeys, and Stickiness over Time charts. These charts support various analysis modes and can be enhanced with features like Microscope for detailed data point inspection, Historical Count for tracking Nth instances of user actions, and Anomaly + Forecast for detecting statistical deviations using Prophet-based algorithms.

**Cohort Analysis**: The platform provides sophisticated user segmentation through behavioral cohorts that group users based on shared traits and actions within specific time periods. Users can create cohorts through multiple methods including Microscope, CSV import, and inline creation within charts. Advanced features include behavior offset for cross-period analysis and cohort comparison capabilities.

**Account-Level Reporting**: The Accounts add-on enables group-level analytics instead of individual user reporting, supporting up to five group types per project with 1000 account-level properties. This feature integrates with Group Identify API and supports both event-level and user-level group definitions.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Group Types and Values**: In account-level reporting, group types represent categories of accounts (e.g., "company") while group values are specific instances (e.g., "Amplitude Inc"). Groups can be defined at the event level or user level with different persistence behaviors.

**Historical Count**: A feature that tracks the Nth instance (up to 5th) of user actions with a one-year lookback period, supporting specific operators (=, ≠, <, ≤, >, ≥) across various chart types.

**Behavioral Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments based on actions and traits within specific time periods, with support for complex conditions including event counting methods (count, relative count, total sum of property, distinct values), temporal parameters (during, since, within), and logical operators.

**Session Replay**: Qualitative user session recordings for web applications that sync with event streams, providing 90-day retention and integration with various chart types through the Microscope feature.

**Spaces**: Collaborative workspaces for organizing and sharing analytics content with permission controls (can edit/add/view) and integration with Slack for notifications.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

**AI and Conversational Analytics**: The platform integrates advanced AI capabilities through Ask Amplitude (using Amazon Bedrock LLM API) for natural language chart creation and the Amplitude Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server for conversational AI analysis with 17 specialized tools.

**Third-Party Integrations**: Extensive integration ecosystem includes Slack for notifications and chart unfurling, Google Workspace for data export to Sheets and Slides, Atlassian Smart Links for Confluence and Jira embedding, Miro for chart embedding, and Notion for document integration.

**Marketing Analytics**: Out-of-the-box marketing analytics provides pre-configured tracking for Traffic by Channel, Traffic by Campaign, Ad Performance, Page Engagement, and Conversion metrics with UTM parameter configuration and attribution models (first-touch and last-touch).

**Data Management**: Comprehensive data governance through features like Chart Cleanup for bulk management, domain proxy services for data routing, debugging tools including Ingestion Debugger and User Lookup, and external sharing capabilities with password protection and expiration controls.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Core APIs**: HTTP V2 API and Batch API for event ingestion, Group Identify API for account-level reporting, Identify API for user properties, and Dashboard REST API for data export.

**SDK Configuration**: Multiple SDK options with configurable endpoints including `serverUrl`, `apiEndpoint`, and `setServerUrl` functions for custom domain proxy setups routing through `api2.amplitude.com`.

**Instrumentation Tools**: Chrome Instrumentation Explorer extension for Browser SDK debugging, real-time event monitoring through Sources tab, and validation tools for tracking plan implementation.

The platform serves organizations from Starter to Enterprise levels with tiered feature availability, supporting complex analytical workflows from basic event tracking to sophisticated behavioral analysis and automated anomaly detection.
