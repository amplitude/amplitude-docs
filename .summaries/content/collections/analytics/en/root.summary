Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that enables organizations to track, analyze, and understand user behavior through event-based data collection and sophisticated reporting capabilities. The platform provides both individual user-level and account-level analytics, with advanced features for cohort analysis, anomaly detection, and collaborative data exploration.

## Core Product Architecture and Features

### Analytics Foundation
The platform centers around event-based analytics with multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, and Pathfinder for user journey mapping. The system supports both real-time and historical data analysis with configurable time ranges and intervals.

### Account-Level Reporting System
Amplitude's Accounts add-on enables group-level analytics through a sophisticated instrumentation system supporting up to 5 group types per project. This includes event-level groups (associating events with groups at ingestion) and user-level groups (linking users to groups via Identify API). The system integrates with external platforms like Salesforce for dynamic group properties and supports up to 1,000 account-level properties.

### Behavioral Cohorts and Segmentation
The platform provides advanced user segmentation through behavioral cohorts that group users based on shared traits and actions within specific time periods. This includes support for complex temporal parameters (during/since/within clauses), logical operators (and/or conditions), and specialized features like behavior offset for analyzing user behaviors across distinct time periods with rolling windows.

### AI and Machine Learning Capabilities
Amplitude incorporates several AI-powered features:
- **Ask Amplitude**: A conversational AI interface using OpenAI's LLM API for natural language chart creation and navigation
- **Anomaly + Forecast**: Prophet-based algorithms for detecting statistical anomalies in time-series data with configurable confidence intervals
- **Insights**: Machine learning-powered alerts for automatic anomaly detection in product metrics
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Automated investigation of anomalous data points through event property analysis

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Core Analytics Terms
- **Event Segmentation**: Primary chart type for analyzing event frequency and properties over time
- **Funnel Analysis**: Conversion tracking through sequential user actions
- **Behavioral Cohorts**: Dynamic user groups based on shared behaviors and traits
- **Historical Count**: Feature tracking the Nth instance (up to 5th) of user actions with one-year lookback
- **Microscope**: Data point inspection tool for detailed user-level analysis

### Account-Level Terminology
- **Group Types**: Categories for organizing accounts (maximum 5 per project)
- **Group Values**: Specific identifiers within group types
- **Event-Level Groups**: Groups associated with events at ingestion time
- **User-Level Groups**: Groups linked to users through identification APIs
- **Group Identify API**: Endpoint for creating and updating group properties

### Data Management Terms
- **Session Replay**: Qualitative user session recordings synchronized with event streams
- **Autocapture Events**: Automatically tracked user interactions (Page Viewed, Element Clicked)
- **UTM Parameters**: Marketing attribution parameters (utm_campaign, utm_content, utm_medium, utm_source, utm_term)
- **Daily Ad Metrics**: Automated event for marketing performance tracking

## Integration and API Ecosystem

### Data Ingestion APIs
- **HTTP V2 API**: Primary endpoint for event ingestion with group support
- **Batch API**: Bulk event processing with group-level capabilities
- **Identify API**: User property management with groups key support
- **Group Identify API**: Dedicated endpoint for group property operations ($set, $setOnce, $add, $append, $unset)

### SDK Integration
The platform supports multiple SDKs (Android, iOS, JavaScript, Browser SDK) with configurable endpoints for domain proxy setups. The Chrome Instrumentation Explorer extension provides debugging capabilities for Browser SDK implementations.

### Third-Party Integrations
- **Segment**: Both Actions and Classic destinations with group type/value trait mapping
- **Salesforce**: Dynamic group properties synchronization
- **Slack**: Link unfurling, comment notifications, and team space connections
- **Google Workspace**: Drive and Sheets sync for data export
- **Atlassian**: Smart Links for Confluence and Jira chart embedding
- **Notion**: Chart embedding through URL pasting
- **Miro**: Direct chart integration via marketplace plugin

## Collaboration and Content Management

### Spaces and Permissions
Amplitude uses a spaces-based collaboration model with granular permissions (can edit/add/view) and project-level overrides. Users can create shortcuts for multi-space content sharing and integrate with Slack for team notifications.

### Content Types and Organization
- **Charts**: Primary analytical visualizations with various types
- **Dashboards**: Collections of charts with filtering, commenting, and subscription capabilities
- **Notebooks**: Mixed-content analytical reports with text, charts, and metrics
- **Templates**: Reusable dashboard configurations with Find & Replace functionality
- **Cohorts**: User segments available across multiple chart types

### Sharing and Distribution
The platform supports multiple sharing mechanisms including direct sharing with permission controls, public links for external stakeholders, embed codes for external websites, and automated subscriptions with HTML email reports and CSV attachments.

## Advanced Analytics Features

### Marketing Analytics
Out-of-the-box marketing analytics provides centralized tracking through four insight categories: Traffic by Channel, Traffic by Campaign, Ad Performance, Page Engagement, and Conversion tracking. The system includes automated channel classifiers and attribution models (first-touch and last-touch) for marketing performance analysis.

### Product Analytics
Pre-built product analytics views include Product Overview, Onboarding, Feature Engagement, and Retention tracking with configurable active events, retention intervals, and Feature Flags integration.

### Release Tracking
The Releases feature provides automated release detection using semantic versioning and Version user properties, with manual release creation capabilities and Release Timeline views for analyzing user adoption and impact metrics.

The platform serves organizations from Starter through Enterprise tiers, with feature availability varying by plan level and add-on subscriptions like the Accounts add-on and Insights package.
