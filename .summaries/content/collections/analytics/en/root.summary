Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that enables organizations to track, analyze, and understand user behavior through event-based data collection and sophisticated analytical tools. The platform provides both individual user-level and account-level reporting capabilities, with advanced features for cohort analysis, anomaly detection, and collaborative analytics workflows.

## Core Product Architecture and Features

### Analytics Foundation
The platform centers around event-based analytics with multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, and Pathfinder for user journey mapping. The system supports both real-time and historical data analysis with configurable time ranges and intervals. Charts can be organized into dashboards, shared externally via public links or embed codes, and integrated into collaborative workflows through Notebooks for analytical reporting.

### Account-Level Reporting System
Amplitude's Accounts add-on enables group-level analytics beyond individual user tracking. This system supports up to 5 group types per project with event-level and user-level group associations. Implementation occurs through multiple APIs including the Group Identify API for group property management, HTTP V2 API with event-level groups, and integration with Segment for group calls. The system includes dynamic group properties with Salesforce integration and supports up to 1,000 account-level properties per project.

### Behavioral Cohorts and Segmentation
The platform provides sophisticated user segmentation through behavioral cohorts that group users based on shared traits and actions within specific time periods. Cohorts can be created through multiple methods: Microscope for static/behavioral cohorts from data points, CSV import for static cohorts, and inline creation within the Segmentation module. Advanced features include behavior offset for analyzing behaviors across distinct time periods, rolling windows, and cohort population tracking over time through dynamic behavioral cohorts.

### Machine Learning and Anomaly Detection
Amplitude incorporates Prophet-based algorithms for anomaly detection and forecasting across time-series data. The Anomaly + Forecast feature operates in agile, robust, and custom modes with configurable confidence intervals and training data durations. The Insights alerts system provides automatic anomaly detection for instrumented events with smart alerts for Event Segmentation and Funnel Analysis charts. Root Cause Analysis (RCA) automatically investigates anomalous data points by analyzing event properties and comparing them to baselines.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Group Types and Values
- **Group Types**: Categories for organizing accounts (maximum 5 per project)
- **Group Values**: Specific identifiers within group types for individual accounts
- **Event-level Groups**: Group associations applied to individual events
- **User-level Groups**: Group associations applied to user profiles

### Cohort Classifications
- **Behavioral Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments based on actions and traits within time periods
- **Static Cohorts**: Fixed user lists imported via CSV or created from specific data points
- **Inline Cohorts**: Cohorts created directly within chart analysis workflows

### Historical Count System
- **Historical Count**: Tracks the Nth instance (up to 5th) of user actions with one-year lookback
- **Event Historical Count**: Applied first in filter operations before other constraints
- **Conversion Windows**: Time periods for measuring funnel progression in Historical Count analyses

### Attribution Models
- **First-touch Attribution**: Credits the first marketing channel in the conversion path
- **Last-touch Attribution**: Credits the final marketing channel before conversion
- **Channel Classifiers**: Sequential rules determining marketing channels for individual events

## Integration Ecosystem and APIs

### Data Ingestion and APIs
The platform supports multiple data ingestion methods including Browser SDK, server-side APIs (HTTP V2, Batch API, Identify API), and third-party integrations. The Group Identify API manages group properties with operations including $set, $setOnce, $add, $append, and $unset. Domain proxy configuration allows routing events through custom domains instead of api2.amplitude.com.

### Third-Party Integrations
Amplitude integrates extensively with collaboration tools including Slack for notifications and chart previews, Atlassian Smart Links for Confluence and Jira embedding, Notion for chart embedding, Miro for visual collaboration, and Google Workspace through the Sync to Drive and Sheets extension. The platform also supports Segment integration for both Actions and Classic implementations.

### Session Replay and Debugging
Session Replay provides qualitative user session recordings synchronized with event streams, accessible through charts, User Lookup, and homepage widgets with 90-day retention. Debugging tools include the Ingestion Debugger for monitoring requests and throttled users, User Lookup for event stream analysis, and Chrome Instrumentation Explorer extension for Browser SDK validation.

## Collaboration and Sharing Features

### Spaces and Permissions
The platform organizes content through spaces with granular permission controls (can edit/add/view). Users can move content between spaces, create shortcuts for multi-space sharing, and integrate with Slack for team notifications. Personal workspaces provide individual content organization separate from shared spaces.

### External Sharing and Templates
Charts and dashboards can be shared externally through public links with password protection and expiration settings. The template system enables reusable dashboard creation with Find & Replace functionality for standardizing analyses across A/B testing, releases, and engagement tracking scenarios.

## Specific API Endpoints and Commands

### Key API Integrations
- **Group Identify API**: `/groupidentify` endpoint for group property management
- **HTTP V2 API**: Event ingestion with group-level data
- **Batch API**: Bulk event processing with group associations
- **Dashboard REST API**: Powers Google Sheets integration and external data export
- **Releases API**: Automated release detection and tracking

### SDK Configuration
- **JavaScript SDK**: `amplitude.setServerUrl()` for domain proxy configuration
- **Browser SDK**: Integration with Session Replay and Autocapture events
- **Mobile SDKs**: Support for app_version user property and release tracking

The platform operates across Scholarship, Plus, Growth, and Enterprise plan tiers with feature restrictions based on subscription level, particularly for advanced features like account-level reporting, anomaly detection, and enhanced collaboration controls.
