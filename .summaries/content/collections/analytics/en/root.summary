Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that enables organizations to track, analyze, and understand user behavior across their digital products. The platform provides sophisticated event-based analytics with advanced segmentation, cohort analysis, and behavioral insights to drive data-driven product decisions.

## Core Product Architecture

Amplitude Analytics operates on an event-driven architecture where user interactions are captured as events with associated properties. The platform supports multiple analysis levels including individual user analytics and account-level reporting through the Accounts add-on, which enables group-level analytics for B2B use cases. The system can track up to five group types per project and supports both event-level and user-level group associations.

The platform integrates with various data sources through multiple APIs including HTTP V2 API, Batch API, Identify API, and Group Identify API. It also supports integrations with Segment (both Actions and Classic destinations), Salesforce with daily sync capabilities, and various other third-party platforms.

## Key Features and Capabilities

### Chart Types and Analysis Tools
Amplitude provides multiple chart types for different analytical needs:
