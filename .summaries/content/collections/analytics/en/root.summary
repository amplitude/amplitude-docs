Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that enables organizations to track, analyze, and understand user behavior through event-based data collection and sophisticated reporting capabilities. The platform provides both individual user-level and account-level analytics, with advanced features for cohort analysis, anomaly detection, forecasting, and collaborative data exploration.

## Core Product Architecture and Features

### Analytics Foundation
The platform centers around event-based analytics with multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, User Sessions, Retention Analysis, Pathfinder, and Journeys. These charts support various visualization modes (charts/KPIs/tables) and can be organized into dashboards for comprehensive reporting. The system processes events through APIs (HTTP V2, Batch, Identify) and SDKs (Android, iOS, JavaScript, Browser SDK) with real-time ingestion capabilities.

### Account-Level Reporting System
Amplitude's Accounts add-on enables group-level analytics through a sophisticated group types system (limited to 5 per project). Organizations can implement event-level groups (attached to individual events) or user-level groups (associated with user profiles) using the Group Identify API for property operations ($set, $setOnce, $add, $append, $unset). This system integrates with Salesforce for dynamic group properties and supports Segment integration through Group Type/Value Traits.

### Behavioral Cohorts and Segmentation
The platform provides advanced user segmentation through behavioral cohorts that group users based on shared traits and actions within specific time periods. Cohorts can be created through multiple methods: Microscope data point selection, CSV import (supporting User IDs/Amplitude IDs with 50MB file limits), or inline creation within the Segmentation module. The system supports complex cohort definitions with event counting methods (count, relative count, total sum of property, distinct values, historical count, count in interval) and temporal parameters (during, since, within clauses).

### AI and Machine Learning Capabilities
Amplitude incorporates several AI-powered features including Ask Amplitude (conversational interface using OpenAI's LLM API), Anomaly + Forecast (Prophet-based algorithm for time-series anomaly detection), and Insights alerts for automated anomaly detection. The Root Cause Analysis feature automatically investigates anomalous data points by analyzing event properties and comparing them to baselines.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Group Types and Group Values**: Core components of account-level reporting where group types represent categories (e.g., "Company") and group values represent specific instances (e.g., "Amplitude Inc.")

**Behavioral Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments based on actions and properties, distinguished from static cohorts which contain fixed user lists

**Historical Count**: Feature tracking the Nth instance (up to 5th) of user actions with one-year lookback period, supporting specific operators (=, ≠, <, ≤, >, ≥)

**Microscope**: Data exploration tool allowing drill-down into specific chart data points for user streams, cohort creation, and session replay access

**Spaces**: Collaboration framework organizing content with permission levels (can edit/add/view) and supporting shortcuts for multi-space content sharing

**Session Replay**: Qualitative analysis feature providing web application session recordings synchronized with event streams (90-day retention, web-only)

## API Endpoints and Technical Integration

The platform exposes several key APIs:
- **HTTP V2 API**: Primary event ingestion endpoint (api2.amplitude.com)
- **Batch API**: Bulk event processing
- **Identify API**: User property management with groups key support
- **Group Identify API**: Account-level property operations
- **Dashboard REST API**: Chart data export functionality
- **Releases API**: Product change tracking

Domain proxy configuration is supported through NGINX with proxy_pass setup, allowing organizations to relay events through their own domains instead of direct api2.amplitude.com communication.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

### Third-Party Integrations
Amplitude integrates extensively with external platforms including Slack (link unfurling, notifications, team spaces), Google Workspace (Drive/Sheets sync, OAuth authentication), Atlassian (Smart Links for Confluence/Jira), Notion (chart embedding), Miro (plug-in for board integration), and Segment (Actions/Classic destinations).

### Marketing Analytics Capabilities
The platform provides Out-of-the-box Marketing Analytics with channel classifiers applying sequential rules for marketing channel determination, attribution models (first-touch/last-touch), and UTM parameter tracking. Daily Ad Metrics events support CAC, ROAS, CTR, and CPC calculations with configurable campaign tracking.

### Content Management and Collaboration
Amplitude supports comprehensive content lifecycle management through Chart Cleanup (bulk chart management), Templates (reusable dashboard patterns with Find & Replace functionality), Notebooks (analytical reports with mixed content), and external sharing capabilities (public links, embed codes, password protection).

### Plan-Based Feature Distribution
Features are distributed across Scholarship, Plus, Growth, and Enterprise plans with specific limitations: Plus users have five-cohort limits, Growth/Enterprise plans include advanced features like automated release detection, Session Replay, enhanced Insights, and expanded collaboration controls.

The platform maintains data governance through role-based permissions (admin, manager, member), organization-level settings for content access, and BAA compatibility considerations for healthcare organizations using AI features.
