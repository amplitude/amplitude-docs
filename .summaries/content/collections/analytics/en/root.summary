- **Static Cohorts**: Fixed lists of users, often imported from external sources
- **Sessions**: Groups of user events that occur within a defined time period
- **Channel Classifiers**: Rules that categorize traffic sources at query time
- **Attribution Models**: Methods for crediting marketing channels for conversions
- **Historical Count**: Feature for tracking user behavior for different instances of specific actions
- **Microscope**: Tool for analyzing specific data points in charts
- **Spaces**: Organizational units for content with specific permission levels
- **Templates**: Reusable dashboard configurations with customizable parameters
- **Releases**: Markers on time-series charts that track product changes

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Analytics integrates with other Amplitude products and external tools:

1. **Amplitude Platform Components**:
   - **Amplitude Data**: For tracking plan updates and schema management
   - **Amplitude Experiment**: For A/B testing and feature flagging

2. **External Integrations**:
   - **Marketing Tools**: UTM parameter tracking, attribution modeling
   - **CRM Systems**: Salesforce integration for account-level reporting
   - **Collaboration Tools**: Slack, Atlassian, Google Drive, Miro, Notion
   - **Data Platforms**: Segment for data collection and distribution

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

### Key APIs
- **HTTP V2 API**: Primary endpoint for sending events (`api2.amplitude.com`)
- **Identify API**: For updating user properties
- **Group Identify API**: For creating and updating group properties

### SDK Implementation
```javascript
// JavaScript SDK example for group-level tracking
amplitude.getInstance().setGroup('account_id', '15'); 
amplitude.getInstance().logEventWithGroups('Button Clicked', 
  {buttonColor: 'blue'}, 
  {account_id: '15'}
);

// Group Identify API example
amplitude.getInstance().groupIdentify('account_id', '15', 
  new amplitude.Identify().set('plan', 'enterprise')
);
```

### Domain Proxy Configuration
Organizations can set up a domain proxy to relay events to Amplitude through their own domain:
```nginx
# NGINX proxy configuration example
location /amplitude/ {
  proxy_pass https://api2.amplitude.com/;
  proxy_set_header Host api2.amplitude.com;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
}
```

## Plan Limitations and Availability

Features are distributed across different plan tiers:
- **Plus Plan**: Limited to five behavioral cohorts
- **Growth Plan**: Includes templates, Root Cause Analysis, Session Replay, external sharing
- **Enterprise Plan**: Includes all features with maximum capabilities

Some specific features like Ask Amplitude have additional privacy considerations, such as limited data sharing with OpenAI's API and BAA limitations.
