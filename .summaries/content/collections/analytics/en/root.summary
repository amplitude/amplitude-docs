Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that enables organizations to track, analyze, and understand user behavior through event-based data collection and sophisticated reporting capabilities. The platform provides both individual user-level and account-level analytics, with advanced features for cohort analysis, anomaly detection, forecasting, and collaborative data exploration.

## Core Product Architecture and Features

### Analytics Foundation
Amplitude Analytics centers around event-based tracking where user interactions are captured as events with associated properties. The platform supports both individual user analytics and account-level reporting through the Accounts add-on, which enables group-level analytics for B2B use cases. The system processes events through various APIs including the HTTP V2 API, Batch API, Identify API, and Group Identify API for comprehensive data ingestion.

### Chart Types and Visualization
The platform offers multiple chart types for different analytical needs:
- **Event Segmentation** charts for measuring event frequency and user engagement
- **Funnel Analysis** for conversion tracking and drop-off analysis
- **User Sessions** charts for session-based metrics
- **Retention Analysis** for measuring user return behavior
- **Stickiness** charts for engagement frequency analysis
- **Journeys/Pathfinder** for user path exploration

### Advanced Analytics Capabilities
Amplitude provides sophisticated analytical features including **Anomaly + Forecast** using Prophet-based algorithms for detecting statistical deviations in time-series data, **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)** for investigating anomalous data points, and **Historical Count** functionality for tracking the Nth instance of user actions with up to one-year lookback periods.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### User and Group Management
- **User ID/Device ID**: Primary identifiers for tracking individual users
- **Group Types**: Categories for account-level reporting (limited to 5 per project)
- **Group Values**: Specific instances within group types
- **Event-level vs User-level Groups**: Distinction between groups associated with specific events versus user profiles

### Cohorts and Segmentation
- **Behavioral Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments based on shared actions within time periods
- **Static Cohorts**: Fixed user lists imported via CSV or created from specific data points
- **Inline Cohorts**: Cohorts created directly within chart analysis workflows
- **Behavioral Offset**: Feature for analyzing user behavior across two distinct time periods

### Data Analysis Components
- **Microscope**: Drill-down functionality for exploring specific data points in charts
- **Session Replay**: Qualitative recordings of user sessions synchronized with event streams
- **UTM Parameters**: Marketing attribution tracking (utm_campaign, utm_content, utm_medium, utm_source, utm_term)
- **Channel Classifiers**: Sequential rules for determining marketing channel attribution

## Collaboration and Content Management

### Spaces and Sharing
Amplitude organizes content through **Spaces** - collaborative environments where teams can share charts, dashboards, and analyses. The platform supports various permission levels (Can edit/Can add/Can view) and integrates with external platforms through **Public Links**, **Embed Codes**, and integrations with Slack, Notion, Miro, and Google Workspace.

### Content Types
- **Charts**: Individual analytical visualizations
- **Dashboards**: Collections of charts with filtering and subscription capabilities
- **Notebooks**: Mixed-content analytical reports combining charts, text, and metrics
- **Templates**: Reusable dashboard configurations with Find & Replace functionality
- **Cohorts**: User segments for targeted analysis

### Organizational Features
The platform includes **Chart Cleanup** for bulk chart management, **Spaces** for team collaboration, **Personal Workspace** for individual content organization, and comprehensive **Search** functionality with filtering options across all content types.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

### Data Ingestion and APIs
Amplitude integrates with various data sources through multiple APIs and SDKs (Android, iOS, JavaScript, server-side). The platform supports **Domain Proxy** configurations for routing events through custom domains and provides debugging tools including the **Ingestion Debugger** and **Chrome Instrumentation Explorer**.

### Third-Party Integrations
The platform extensively integrates with external tools:
- **Segment** integration for data pipeline management with Actions and Classic destinations
- **Salesforce** integration for dynamic group properties
- **Slack** for notifications, link unfurling, and team collaboration
- **Google Workspace** through Sync to Drive and Sheets extension
- **Atlassian Smart Links** for Confluence and Jira integration
- **Notion** and **Miro** for chart embedding

### Marketing and Product Analytics
Amplitude provides specialized analytics modules including **Out-of-the-box Marketing Analytics** with Traffic by Channel, Ad Performance, and Conversion tracking, and **Product Analytics** with pre-built views for Product Overview, Onboarding, Feature Engagement, and Retention analysis.

## Plan-Based Feature Distribution

Features are distributed across different plan tiers:
- **Scholarship/Plus Plans**: Basic analytics with some limitations
- **Growth Plans**: Enhanced features including behavioral cohorts, advanced integrations
- **Enterprise Plans**: Full feature access including advanced security, custom implementations

The platform includes specialized add-ons like the **Accounts add-on** for group-level reporting and the **Insights add-on** for advanced anomaly detection and forecasting capabilities.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

Key API endpoints include:
- **HTTP V2 API** and **Batch API** for event ingestion
- **Identify API** for user property updates with `groups` key support
- **Group Identify API** for account-level property management with operations ($set, $setOnce, $add, $append, $unset)
- **Dashboard REST API** for programmatic dashboard access
- **Releases API** for product change tracking

The platform supports various SDK configurations including `serverUrl`, `apiEndpoint`, and `setServerUrl` functions for custom endpoint routing, particularly useful for domain proxy implementations.
