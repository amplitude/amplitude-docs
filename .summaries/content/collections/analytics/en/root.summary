Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that enables organizations to track, analyze, and understand user behavior across web and mobile applications. The platform provides both individual user-level and account-level analytics capabilities, with advanced features for cohort analysis, anomaly detection, and collaborative data exploration.

## Core Product Architecture

Amplitude Analytics operates on a multi-layered architecture centered around events, users, and groups. The platform supports both traditional user-centric analytics and account-level reporting through the Accounts add-on, which enables group-level analysis for B2B use cases. The system processes events through various APIs (HTTP V2, Batch, Identify, Group Identify) and SDKs (Android, iOS, JavaScript, Browser SDK), with instrumentation validation tools like the Ingestion Debugger and Chrome Instrumentation Explorer extension.

The platform's data model revolves around events with properties, user properties, and group properties, supporting up to 5 group types per project and 1000 account-level properties. Events can be analyzed through multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, and specialized views like Journeys (Pathfinder) and Microscope for detailed user stream analysis.

## Key Features and Capabilities

**Analytics Charts and Visualization**: The platform offers comprehensive chart types for different analytical needs - Event Segmentation for trend analysis, Funnel Analysis for conversion tracking, Retention Analysis for user lifecycle understanding, and User Sessions for engagement metrics. Charts support advanced features like Historical Count (tracking up to the 5th instance of user actions), Anomaly + Forecast using Prophet algorithms, and behavioral cohort integration.

**Cohorts and Segmentation**: Amplitude provides sophisticated user segmentation through behavioral cohorts that group users based on shared traits and actions within specific time periods. Cohorts can be created through multiple methods: Microscope data point drilling, CSV import (static cohorts), inline creation within charts, and behavioral definitions with complex event-based conditions including count, relative count, total sum of property, and distinct values.

**Account-Level Reporting**: The Accounts add-on enables group-level analytics instead of individual user reporting, supporting both event-level and user-level groups. This includes integration with Salesforce for dynamic group properties, Group Identify API for property operations ($set, $setOnce, $add, $append, $unset), and specialized group behavioral cohorts.

**Collaboration and Sharing**: The platform emphasizes collaborative analytics through Spaces for team organization, Notebooks for analytical reporting with mixed content (text, charts, metrics), and comprehensive sharing capabilities including public links, embed codes, and integrations with Slack, Notion, Miro, Google Drive/Sheets, and Atlassian tools.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events and Properties**: Events represent user actions with associated properties. The platform distinguishes between event properties (specific to individual events) and user properties (persistent attributes). Special events include `[Amplitude] Page Viewed` for web analytics and Daily Ad Metrics for marketing attribution.

**Groups and Group Types**: Groups represent accounts or organizations, with group types defining the category (e.g., "company", "team") and group values being specific instances. Event-level groups associate events with accounts, while user-level groups associate users with accounts.

**Cohorts**: Behavioral cohorts are dynamic user segments based on actions and properties, while static cohorts are fixed user lists. Cohorts support temporal parameters (during, since, within) and logical operators (and/or clauses).

**Sessions**: Amplitude defines sessions as periods of user activity, with configurable session definitions and metrics including session entries, exits, totals, and duration calculations.

**Attribution Models**: The platform supports first-touch and last-touch attribution for marketing analytics, using channel classifiers that apply sequential rules to determine marketing channels from UTM parameters and referrer values.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Analytics integrates extensively with the broader product ecosystem through multiple channels:

**Data Integration**: The platform connects with Segment (both Actions and Classic destinations), Salesforce for dynamic group properties, and various ad networks for marketing attribution. Domain proxy services enable event routing through custom domains instead of direct api2.amplitude.com connections.

**Collaboration Tools**: Deep integrations with Slack (link unfurling, notifications, team spaces), Google Workspace (Drive sync, Sheets export), Notion (chart embedding), Miro (chart integration), and Atlassian products (Smart Links for Confluence and Jira).

**Development and Debugging**: Chrome Instrumentation Explorer extension for Browser SDK debugging, User Lookup for event stream analysis, and comprehensive API documentation for custom implementations.

**Advanced Analytics**: Integration with Amplitude Data for tracking plan management, Amplitude Experiment for A/B testing analysis, Feature Flags for feature adoption tracking, and Session Replay for qualitative user behavior analysis.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Core APIs**: HTTP V2 API for event ingestion, Batch API for bulk data processing, Identify API for user property updates, Group Identify API for account-level property management, and Dashboard REST API for programmatic chart access.

**SDK Configuration**: Multiple SDKs support custom endpoint configuration through parameters like `serverUrl`, `apiEndpoint`, and `setServerUrl()` functions for domain proxy implementations.

**Authentication and Access**: OAuth integration for Google services, Atlassian authentication for Smart Links, and comprehensive permission systems supporting organizational, project, and content-level access controls.

The platform operates on tiered plans (Starter, Plus, Growth, Enterprise) with feature restrictions and limits varying by subscription level, including cohort limits, advanced analytics features, and collaboration capabilities.
