Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that enables organizations to track, analyze, and understand user behavior across web and mobile applications. The platform provides both individual user-level and account-level analytics capabilities, with advanced features for cohort analysis, anomaly detection, and collaborative data exploration.

## Core Product Architecture and Features

**Analytics Foundation**: The platform centers around event-based analytics, tracking user interactions through instrumented events that can be analyzed across multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, and Pathfinder. The system supports both real-time and historical analysis with configurable time windows and sophisticated filtering capabilities.

**Account-Level Reporting**: The Accounts add-on extends analytics beyond individual users to group-level analysis, supporting up to 5 group types per project. This enables B2B analytics by tracking account-level behaviors, with integration capabilities for Salesforce and support for dynamic group properties through the Group Identify API.

**Behavioral Cohorts**: Users can be segmented into cohorts based on shared traits and behaviors within specific time periods. The platform supports both static cohorts (imported via CSV) and dynamic behavioral cohorts that automatically update based on defined criteria, with advanced features like behavior offset for comparing actions across different time periods.

## Key Product Relationships and Ecosystem

**Chart and Dashboard Ecosystem**: Charts serve as the fundamental analytical building blocks that can be organized into dashboards for comprehensive reporting. Dashboards support bulk filtering, subscription-based delivery, and template creation for standardized analyses. The platform includes specialized chart types for different analytical needs, from basic event tracking to complex funnel and retention analyses.

**Collaboration and Sharing Infrastructure**: Amplitude provides multiple collaboration layers including Spaces for team organization, Notebooks for analytical storytelling, and comprehensive sharing capabilities with external stakeholders through public links and embed codes. Integration with tools like Slack, Miro, Notion, and Atlassian products enables seamless workflow integration.

**AI and Automation Features**: Ask Amplitude provides conversational AI interface using OpenAI's LLM for natural language chart creation and navigation. The Anomaly + Forecast feature uses Prophet algorithms for automated anomaly detection and forecasting across time-series data, while Insights provides intelligent alerting for metric changes.

## Critical Nomenclature and Definitions

**Groups and Group Types**: In account-level reporting, "groups" represent collections of users (like companies or teams), while "group types" define the category of grouping (e.g., "Company", "Team"). Event-level groups associate individual events with groups, while user-level groups associate users with groups persistently.

**Historical Count**: A specialized filter that tracks the Nth instance (up to 5th) of user actions with a one-year lookback period, enabling analysis of user lifecycle milestones and behavioral patterns.

**Behavioral Cohorts vs Static Cohorts**: Behavioral cohorts dynamically update based on user actions and properties, while static cohorts are fixed lists of users imported via CSV files containing user IDs or Amplitude IDs.

**Session Replay**: Qualitative recordings of user web sessions that sync with quantitative event streams, providing visual context for analytical insights with 90-day default retention.

## API Endpoints and Integration Points

**Core APIs**: 
- HTTP V2 API and Batch API for event ingestion with group-level support
- Identify API for user property updates with `groups` key for account-level reporting
- Group Identify API for creating and updating group properties with operations ($set, $setOnce, $add, $append, $unset)
- Dashboard REST API for programmatic dashboard and chart access

**SDK Integration**: Support for multiple SDKs (Android, iOS, JavaScript, Browser SDK) with configurable endpoints for domain proxy setups, allowing organizations to relay events through their own domains instead of directly to api2.amplitude.com.

**Third-Party Integrations**: 
- Segment integration supporting both Actions and Classic implementations with Group Type/Value Traits
- Salesforce integration for dynamic group properties synchronization
- Google Workspace integration through "Amplitude Sync to Drive and Sheets" extension
- Marketing analytics with UTM parameter tracking and Daily Ad Metrics events

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

**Data Governance and Quality**: Integration with Amplitude Data for tracking plan management, with notifications for schema changes and validation tools including the Ingestion Debugger and Chrome Instrumentation Explorer for debugging analytics implementation.

**Advanced Analytics Features**: Out-of-the-box analytics for both marketing and product analytics, providing pre-configured views for common use cases like Traffic by Channel, Product Overview, Onboarding analysis, and Feature Engagement tracking.

**Enterprise and Collaboration Features**: Tiered functionality across Scholarship, Plus, Growth, and Enterprise plans, with advanced features like custom templates, enhanced sharing controls, and administrative tools like Chart Cleanup for bulk chart management across organizations.

The platform serves as a comprehensive analytics ecosystem that scales from individual user analysis to enterprise-wide account-level reporting, with extensive customization, automation, and integration capabilities for modern product and marketing teams.
