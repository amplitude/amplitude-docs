Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that enables organizations to track, analyze, and understand user behavior through event-based data collection and sophisticated analytical tools. The platform provides both individual user-level and account-level reporting capabilities, with extensive visualization options, collaboration features, and AI-powered insights.

## Core Product Architecture and Features

Amplitude Analytics operates on an event-driven architecture where user interactions are captured as events with associated properties. The platform supports both individual user analytics and group-level analytics through the Accounts add-on, which enables analysis of account-level behaviors rather than individual user actions. The system processes data through various APIs including the HTTP V2 API, Batch API, Identify API, and Group Identify API, with specialized endpoints like `/2/httpapi` for event ingestion.

The platform's analytical capabilities center around multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Pathfinder, and Journeys charts. These visualizations can be enhanced with advanced features like Anomaly + Forecast (using Prophet algorithms), Historical Count tracking (up to 5th instance), and Root Cause Analysis for investigating data anomalies.

## Key Product Relationships and Ecosystem

Amplitude Analytics integrates deeply with collaboration and productivity tools through native integrations with Slack, Notion, Miro, Google Drive/Sheets, and Atlassian products (Confluence, Jira, Trello). The platform supports external sharing through public links and embed codes, enabling stakeholder communication beyond the organization.

The product ecosystem includes specialized modules like the Segmentation Module for behavioral cohorts, Session Replay for qualitative user session recordings, and Ask Amplitude (an AI conversational interface using Amazon Bedrock LLM). Marketing analytics capabilities are provided through Out-of-the-box Marketing Analytics with UTM parameter tracking and channel attribution models.

## Critical Nomenclature and Definitions

**Groups and Account-Level Reporting**: Group types and group values enable account-level analytics, with support for up to five group types per project. Event-level groups associate events with accounts, while user-level groups associate users with accounts through the Group Identify API.

**Behavioral Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments based on shared behaviors within specific time periods, supporting complex conditions including event counting methods (count, relative count, total sum of property, distinct values, historical count), temporal parameters (during, since, within), and logical operators.

**Historical Count**: Tracks the Nth instance (up to 5th) of user actions with a one-year lookback period, applied last in the filter order of operations except for Event Historical Count which applies first.

**Microscope**: Data inspection tool enabling detailed analysis of chart data points with options for user stream viewing, cohort creation, and session replay integration.

**Spaces**: Collaboration framework with permission levels (can edit/add/view) and content organization capabilities, supporting shortcuts for multi-space content sharing.

## API Endpoints and Technical Integration

The platform exposes several key APIs:
- **HTTP V2 API**: Primary event ingestion endpoint at `api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`
- **Group Identify API**: For account-level group property management
- **Identify API**: For user property updates
- **Batch API**: For bulk event processing
- **Dashboard REST API**: For Google Drive integration and external data export

Domain proxy configuration is supported through NGINX with `proxy_pass` directives, allowing organizations to relay events through their own domains rather than directly to Amplitude's servers.

## Advanced Analytics and AI Features

**Anomaly + Forecast** uses Prophet-based algorithms with configurable confidence intervals (95%, 98%, 99%) and training data durations (120-365 days) across multiple chart types. The system supports agile, robust, and custom detection modes with automated project alerts.

**Ask Amplitude** provides conversational analytics through Amazon Bedrock LLM API, enabling natural language chart creation and editing while maintaining data governance through controlled metadata sharing.

**Insights** delivers automated anomaly detection with machine learning, supporting automatic alerts for events with 100+ daily volume and custom alerts with various confidence intervals.

## Content Management and Collaboration

The platform supports comprehensive content lifecycle management through dashboards, notebooks, templates, and spaces. Dashboard templates enable reusable analytical frameworks with parameterized events, properties, cohorts, and date ranges. Notebooks provide mixed-content analytical reports with rich text formatting, drag-and-drop rearrangement, and metric tracking capabilities.

Chart Cleanup functionality allows organizational-level bulk management of saved charts with filtering by owner, space, and project. The Breadcrumbs feature tracks analysis evolution and enables direct notebook creation from chart views.

## Plan-Based Feature Distribution

Features are distributed across Starter, Plus, Growth, and Enterprise plans with specific limitations:
- **Starter**: 50 dashboard limit
- **Plus**: 5 behavioral cohort limit, manual release creation
- **Growth/Enterprise**: Enhanced permissions, automated release detection, advanced analytics features
- **Enterprise**: Official dashboard designation, enhanced space controls

The platform maintains 90-day default retention for Session Replay data and supports various export formats including CSV, PDF, and PNG for dashboards and charts.
