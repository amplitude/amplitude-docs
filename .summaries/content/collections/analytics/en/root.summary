Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that enables organizations to track, analyze, and understand user behavior across their digital products. The platform provides sophisticated event-based analytics with advanced segmentation, cohort analysis, and behavioral insights to drive data-driven product decisions.

## Core Product Architecture

Amplitude Analytics operates on an event-driven architecture where user interactions are captured as events with associated properties. The platform supports multiple analysis levels including individual user analytics and account-level reporting through the Accounts add-on, which enables group-level analytics for B2B use cases. The system can track up to five group types per project, allowing analysis at both user and organizational levels.

The platform integrates with various data sources through multiple APIs including HTTP V2 API, Batch API, Identify API, and Group Identify API. It also supports integrations with Segment (both Actions and Classic destinations), Salesforce with daily sync capabilities, and various other third-party platforms.

## Key Analytics Features and Chart Types

Amplitude provides a comprehensive suite of chart types for different analytical needs:

**Event Segmentation Charts** serve as the foundation for measuring event volumes, user counts, and property aggregations over time. These charts support advanced features like Historical Count filtering (tracking up to the 5th instance of user actions), anomaly detection through the Anomaly + Forecast feature using Prophet algorithms, and Root Cause Analysis for investigating anomalous data points.

**Funnel Analysis** enables conversion tracking across multi-step user journeys, with support for Historical Count filters, conversion driver analysis through Microscope, and integration with behavioral cohorts for advanced segmentation.

**Retention Analysis** tracks user return behavior over time with configurable intervals and calendar alignment options, supporting both rolling and fixed time windows.

**User Sessions Analytics** provides session-based metrics including session duration, entries, exits, and engagement patterns, particularly valuable for marketing analytics use cases.

**Pathfinder** offers user journey visualization and path analysis, though it has limitations with certain features like account-level reporting and Historical Count filters.

## Advanced Analytics Capabilities

**Behavioral Cohorts** represent one of Amplitude's most powerful features, allowing dynamic user segmentation based on actions and properties within specific time periods. The platform supports various cohort definition methods including event counting (count, relative count, total sum of property, distinct values, historical count, count in interval), temporal parameters (during, since, within), and user property conditions. Cohorts can be created through multiple methods: Microscope for data point-driven creation, CSV import for static cohorts, and inline creation within chart interfaces.

**Anomaly Detection and Forecasting** leverages Prophet-based machine learning algorithms to identify statistically significant deviations in time-series data. The system offers three modes (agile, robust, custom) with configurable confidence intervals and training data durations ranging from 120-365 days.

**Marketing Analytics** provides specialized tracking through channel classifiers that apply sequential rules to determine marketing channels, attribution models (first-touch and last-touch), and out-of-the-box metrics for tracking page engagement, traffic analysis, and conversion performance.

## Data Investigation and Quality Tools

**Microscope** enables detailed inspection of chart data points, providing access to user streams, path analysis, cohort creation, and session replay integration. This tool is essential for drilling down from aggregate metrics to individual user behavior.

**User Lookup** provides comprehensive user profiles with event streams, session replays, cohort memberships, experiment participation, and feature flag exposure. The system handles complex timestamp calculations including client_event_time, server_received_time, and event_time computations.

**Debugging Tools** include the Ingestion Debugger for monitoring real-time data flow, throttled users tracking, and the Chrome Instrumentation Explorer extension for Browser SDK debugging.

## Collaboration and Sharing Infrastructure

**Spaces** provide team-based collaboration with hierarchical permission management (can edit/add/view), content organization, and Slack integration for notifications. The system supports content shortcuts for multi-space sharing and maintains a clear permission hierarchy where project-level permissions override space-level permissions.

**Dashboards** serve as centralized analytics hubs supporting mixed content including charts, cohorts, and Session Replays. They feature commenting functionality, official designation for Enterprise plans, template creation capabilities, and various export formats (CSV, PDF, PNG). Dashboard subscriptions enable automated HTML email reports and Slack notifications.

**Notebooks** provide analytical reporting capabilities with mixed content support including text blocks, charts, videos, and metrics. They feature drag-and-drop editing, markdown formatting, and chart callouts for comprehensive analysis documentation.

## Integration Ecosystem

Amplitude integrates extensively with external platforms:

**Slack Integration** provides chart link unfurling, comment notifications, tracking plan updates, and team space notifications.

**Google Workspace** integration through the Sync to Drive and Sheets extension enables chart data export to Google Sheets and chart images to Google Slides.

**Atlassian Smart Links** support embedding chart previews in Confluence documents and Jira tickets.

**Miro Integration** allows direct chart embedding onto Miro boards through the Amplitude plug-in.

**Notion Integration** enables chart embedding through URL pasting with authentication flow.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Group Types and Group Values**: Core concepts for account-level reporting where group types represent categories (e.g., "company") and group values represent specific instances (e.g., "Amplitude Inc.").

**Event-Level vs User-Level Groups**: Event-level groups associate specific events with groups, while user-level groups associate users with groups across all their events.

**Historical Count**: A specialized filter for tracking the Nth instance (up to 5th) of user actions with a one-year lookback period.

**Behavioral vs Static Cohorts**: Behavioral cohorts dynamically update based on user actions, while static cohorts contain fixed user lists typically imported via CSV.

**Channel Classifiers**: Sequential rules that determine marketing channels for individual events based on UTM parameters and referrer values.

**Attribution Models**: Methods for crediting acquisition touchpoints, including first-touch and last-touch attribution with configurable lookback windows.

## API Endpoints and Technical Integration

The platform provides several key API endpoints:

- **HTTP V2 API**: Primary endpoint for event ingestion at `api2.amplitude.com`
- **Batch API**: For bulk event processing
- **Identify API**: For user property updates
- **Group Identify API**: For group property management
- **Dashboard REST API**: For programmatic dashboard access
- **Releases API**: For automated release tracking

**Domain Proxy Configuration** allows organizations to relay events through their own domains using NGINX proxy configurations, enhancing data governance and control.

**Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server** at `https://mcp.amplitude.com/v1/mcp` enables conversational AI analysis through 17 specialized tools including query_chart, query_metric, and various get operations.

## Plan-Based Feature Availability

Features are distributed across different plan tiers:

**Starter Plans** include basic analytics with limitations like 50 dashboard maximum.

**Plus Plans** add behavioral cohorts (5 cohort limit), advanced sharing, and manual release creation.

**Growth Plans** provide enhanced collaboration controls, automated release detection, anomaly detection, and Root Cause Analysis with Insights add-on.

**Enterprise Plans** include all features plus official dashboard designation, advanced permissions, and enhanced security controls.

The platform maintains specific limitations such as 90-day Session Replay retention, web-only Session Replay support, and exclusion of canvas/WebGL elements from recordings. Account-level reporting supports up to 1000 account-level properties with a 5 group types limit per project.
