# Amplitude Analytics Product Overview

Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that enables businesses to understand user behavior, track product performance, and make data-driven decisions. The platform combines quantitative and qualitative analytics capabilities to provide insights into how users interact with digital products.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Analytics Capabilities
- **Charts and Dashboards**: Core visualization tools for analyzing user behavior data through various chart types, with customizable dashboards for organizing and sharing insights.
- **Behavioral Cohorts**: Groups of users defined by specific actions taken within set time periods, allowing for targeted analysis of user segments.
- **Account-Level Reporting**: Enables analysis at the group level (accounts, teams, organizations) rather than just individual users, particularly valuable for B2B products.
- **Anomaly Detection and Forecasting**: Identifies statistically significant deviations in metrics and projects future values using the Prophet algorithm with configurable confidence intervals.
- **Session Replay**: Qualitative analytics feature that records and plays back user sessions to provide visual context to quantitative data (available on Growth and Enterprise plans).
- **Ask Amplitude**: Conversational interface that allows users to create charts, search content, and navigate Amplitude using natural language, powered by OpenAI's LLM.

### Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing
- **Spaces**: Collaborative areas where teams can organize and share analytics content with configurable permissions.
- **Notebooks**: Interactive documents that combine text, media, charts, and metrics to provide context and explanations beyond raw data.
- **Templates**: Reusable dashboard configurations that allow teams to efficiently recreate common analyses with customizable parameters.
- **Breadcrumbs**: Feature that tracks and organizes analysis steps, allowing users to document their analytical journey.

### Integrations
- **Slack**: Receive notifications, preview chart links, and connect Team Spaces to Slack channels.
- **Atlassian Smart Links**: Embed Amplitude chart previews in Confluence, Jira, and Trello.
- **Google Drive Sync**: Export chart data to Google Sheets and chart images to Google Slides.
- **Miro**: Add Amplitude charts directly to Miro boards for collaborative visualization.
- **Notion**: Embed Amplitude charts in Notion documents with various display options.

### Out-of-the-Box Analytics
- **Marketing Analytics**: Pre-built dashboards for tracking channel performance, campaign effectiveness, and conversion metrics.
- **Product Analytics**: Centralized dashboards for monitoring key product metrics including active users, retention, and feature engagement.
- **Out-of-the-Box Metrics**: Predefined, consistent metrics that provide standardized definitions across projects.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

### Data Collection and Processing
1. **Event Tracking**: The foundation of Amplitude's analytics, capturing user interactions through SDKs or APIs.
2. **User and Group Identification**: Associates events with individual users and/or groups (accounts, organizations).
3. **Property Tracking**: Captures additional context about events, users, and groups.

### Analytics Hierarchy
1. **Events**: Individual user actions tracked in the system.
2. **Users**: Individuals identified by unique IDs who perform events.
3. **Groups**: Collections of users (accounts, organizations) for B2B analysis.
4. **Cohorts**: Segments of users defined by specific behaviors or properties.
5. **Charts**: Visualizations of event data based on specific metrics and segments.
6. **Dashboards**: Collections of charts organized around specific themes or objectives.
7. **Notebooks**: Interactive documents combining charts, text, and media for storytelling.
8. **Spaces**: Organizational units for sharing and collaborating on analytics content.

### Plan Tiers
Amplitude offers different feature sets across multiple plan tiers:
- **Plus**: Basic features with some limitations (e.g., limited to five behavioral cohorts).
- **Growth**: Expanded features including Session Replay, Root Cause Analysis, and Templates.
- **Enterprise**: Full feature set with advanced capabilities and customizations.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Analytics Concepts
- **Event**: A specific user action tracked in Amplitude (e.g., page view, button click).
- **User Property**: Attributes associated with users (e.g., demographics, preferences).
- **Group Property**: Attributes associated with groups like accounts or organizations.
- **Cohort**: A segment of users defined by specific behaviors or properties.
- **Behavioral Cohort**: A cohort defined by actions users have taken.
- **Static Cohort**: A fixed list of user IDs imported into the system.
- **Historical Count**: Feature that tracks user behavior for different instances of specific actions.

### Chart and Analysis Types
- **Event Segmentation**: Analysis of event trends over time with various segmentations.
- **Funnel Analysis**: Visualization of user progression through a sequence of events.
- **Retention Analysis**: Measurement of how users continue to engage over time.
- **Pathfinder**: Visualization of the paths users take through a product.
- **Microscope**: Tool for analyzing specific data points in charts by hovering over them.

### Collaboration Features
- **Spaces**: Organizational units for sharing analytics content with specific teams.
- **Personal Space/Workspace**: Private area for individual users to access their analyses.
- **Official Dashboard**: Designated source of truth for specific metrics.
- **Templates**: Reusable dashboard configurations for common analyses.

## API Endpoints and Integration Methods

### Data Collection
- **HTTP V2 API**: Primary endpoint for sending events to Amplitude (`api2.amplitude.com`).
- **Identify API**: Used for updating user properties without sending events.
- **Group Identify API**: Used for updating group properties.

### SDK Integration
Amplitude provides SDKs for various platforms:
- **Browser/JavaScript SDK**: For web applications
- **Android SDK**: For Android applications
- **iOS SDK**: For iOS applications
- **Server-side SDKs**: For backend implementations

### Third-Party Integrations
