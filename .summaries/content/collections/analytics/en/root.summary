Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that enables organizations to track, analyze, and understand user behavior across digital products. The platform provides sophisticated event-based analytics with advanced segmentation, cohort analysis, and collaborative features designed for data-driven product teams.

## Core Product Architecture

Amplitude Analytics operates on an event-driven architecture where user interactions are captured as events with associated properties. The platform supports multiple data ingestion methods including SDKs (Android, iOS, JavaScript), server-side APIs (HTTP V2, Batch API, Identify API), and third-party integrations like Segment. Events can be analyzed at both individual user and group levels through the Accounts add-on, which enables account-level reporting for B2B use cases.

The platform's analytical capabilities are built around several core chart types: Event Segmentation for measuring event volumes and user engagement, Funnel Analysis for conversion tracking, Retention Analysis for user stickiness measurement, User Sessions for session-based metrics, and specialized charts like Pathfinder for user journey analysis. These charts integrate with advanced features like Microscope for data point inspection, behavioral cohorts for user segmentation, and Session Replay for qualitative analysis.

## Key Features and Relationships

**Analytics Charts and Visualization**: The platform offers multiple chart types that work together to provide comprehensive product insights. Event Segmentation charts serve as the foundation for measuring user actions, while Funnel Analysis tracks conversion flows between events. These charts integrate with Microscope functionality, allowing users to drill down into specific data points to view user streams, create cohorts, or access session replays.

**Behavioral Cohorts and Segmentation**: Amplitude's cohort system enables dynamic user segmentation based on behavioral patterns across time periods. Cohorts can be created through multiple methods: directly from chart data points via Microscope, through CSV imports, or as inline cohorts within the Segmentation module. The platform supports both user-level and group-level cohorts (with the Accounts add-on), with sophisticated temporal parameters including "during," "since," and "within" clauses.

**Collaboration and Content Management**: The platform emphasizes team collaboration through Spaces for organizing content, Dashboards for executive reporting, and Notebooks for analytical storytelling. Content can be shared externally through public links and embed codes, while internal collaboration is facilitated through commenting systems, Slack integrations, and permission management (Can edit/Can view/Can add).

**Advanced Analytics Features**: Amplitude includes AI-powered capabilities like Ask Amplitude for natural language querying, Anomaly + Forecast using Prophet algorithms for detecting statistical deviations, and Root Cause Analysis for investigating anomalous data points. The Insights feature provides automated alerting for metric changes with configurable confidence intervals.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events and Properties**: Events represent user actions (e.g., "Button Clicked," "Page Viewed"), while properties are attributes that provide context (event properties like "Button Color" or user properties like "Subscription Plan"). The platform distinguishes between event-level properties and user-level properties for different analytical purposes.

**Groups and Accounts**: The Accounts add-on introduces group-level analytics where events can be associated with organizational units like companies or accounts. Group types (limited to 5 per project) define categories like "Company" or "Team," while group values represent specific instances. The Group Identify API manages group properties and relationships.

**Cohorts**: Behavioral cohorts are dynamic user segments based on actions and properties within specific time periods, while static cohorts are fixed user lists typically imported via CSV. Cohorts support complex definitions with event counting methods (count, relative count, total sum of property, distinct values, historical count) and temporal parameters.

**Sessions and Attribution**: Sessions group related user activities within time windows, supporting marketing analytics through channel classifiers and attribution models (first-touch, last-touch). The platform automatically applies sequential rules to determine marketing channels based on UTM parameters and referrer values.

**Historical Count**: A specialized filter for tracking the Nth instance (up to 5th) of user actions with a one-year lookback period, supporting operators like =, ≠, <, ≤, >, ≥ for advanced behavioral analysis.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Analytics integrates extensively with external tools and platforms. Marketing teams benefit from out-of-the-box marketing analytics with UTM parameter tracking, Daily Ad Metrics events, and integration with ad networks for CAC and ROAS calculations. The platform connects with collaboration tools like Slack for notifications and chart sharing, Miro for embedding analytics in design workflows, and Atlassian products (Confluence, Jira) through Smart Links.

Development teams can implement domain proxy services to route analytics through their own infrastructure, while the Chrome Instrumentation Explorer extension assists with debugging Browser SDK implementations. The platform supports Google Workspace through the Sync to Drive and Sheets extension for exporting chart data and images.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

Key API endpoints include:
- **HTTP V2 API**: Primary endpoint at api2.amplitude.com for event ingestion
- **Identify API**: For user property updates and group associations using the `groups` key
- **Group Identify API**: For creating and updating group properties with operations like $set, $setOnce, $add, $append, $unset
- **Batch API**: For bulk event processing
- **Dashboard REST API**: For programmatic dashboard and chart management
- **Releases API**: For tracking product releases and version changes

The platform supports various SDK configurations through parameters like `serverUrl`, `apiEndpoint`, and `setServerUrl()` functions for custom routing. Session Replay requires specific autocapture event implementation, while the Accounts add-on requires proper group type instrumentation with event-level or user-level group associations.

Amplitude Analytics serves as a comprehensive product intelligence platform that scales from individual user tracking to enterprise-wide account analytics, with sophisticated collaboration features and extensive integration capabilities for modern product development workflows.
