Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that enables organizations to track, analyze, and understand user behavior across digital products. The platform provides sophisticated event-based analytics with advanced segmentation, cohort analysis, and collaborative features designed for data-driven product teams.

## Core Product Architecture

Amplitude Analytics operates on an event-driven architecture where user interactions are tracked as discrete events with associated properties. The platform supports both individual user-level analysis and group-level analysis through the Accounts add-on, enabling organizations to analyze behavior at multiple aggregation levels including accounts, companies, or other business units.

The platform integrates multiple analytical modules including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Pathfinder, and specialized features like Session Replay for qualitative insights. These modules work together to provide comprehensive user journey analysis from acquisition through retention and conversion.

## Key Features and Capabilities

**Advanced Analytics Charts**: The platform offers multiple chart types including Event Segmentation for tracking user actions over time, Funnel Analysis for conversion optimization, Retention Analysis for measuring user stickiness, and User Sessions for understanding engagement patterns. Each chart type supports sophisticated filtering, grouping, and comparison capabilities.

**Behavioral Cohorts**: Users can create dynamic behavioral cohorts that automatically update based on user actions and properties, or static cohorts imported from external systems. The platform supports up to five group types per project and enables cohort comparison, tracking population changes over time, and using cohorts across different analytical views.

**Account-Level Reporting**: Through the Accounts add-on, organizations can perform group-level analytics aggregating individual user behavior into account or company-level insights. This includes group-level funnel analysis, behavioral cohorts, and dynamic group properties with support for up to 1,000 group properties per account.

**Anomaly Detection and Forecasting**: The Anomaly + Forecast feature uses Prophet-based algorithms to automatically detect statistical anomalies in time-series data across multiple chart types, offering configurable confidence intervals and training data durations with agile, robust, and custom detection modes.

**Session Replay**: For web applications, Session Replay provides qualitative user session recordings synchronized with event streams, accessible through various chart types and User Lookup with 90-day default retention.

## Collaboration and Sharing Infrastructure

**Spaces and Permissions**: Amplitude organizes content within spaces that enable team collaboration with granular permission controls (can edit/add/view). Content can be moved between spaces, and shortcuts enable multi-space content sharing while maintaining centralized management.

**Dashboards and Templates**: Users can create comprehensive dashboards combining charts, cohorts, and Session Replays with commenting functionality, official designation capabilities, and template creation for standardized analyses. Dashboard templates support Find & Replace functionality for events, properties, cohorts, dates, and projects.

**External Sharing**: The platform supports public link creation and embed code generation for sharing content with external stakeholders, including password protection and expiration settings managed through Organization Settings.

**Notebooks**: Amplitude Notebooks enable creation of analytical reports combining charts, text blocks, videos, and metrics with markdown formatting and drag-and-drop editing capabilities for comprehensive data storytelling.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events and Properties**: Events represent user actions (e.g., "Button Clicked", "Page Viewed") while properties provide additional context about events or users. Event properties describe specific event instances, while user properties describe user characteristics.

**Group Types and Group Values**: In account-level reporting, group types define the category of aggregation (e.g., "company", "account") while group values represent specific instances within that type (e.g., "Amplitude", "Google").

**Historical Count**: A specialized filter that tracks the Nth instance (up to 5th) of user actions with a one-year lookback period, supporting specific operators and applying different logic depending on the analysis context.

**Behavioral vs Static Cohorts**: Behavioral cohorts dynamically update based on user actions and properties, while static cohorts contain fixed user lists typically imported from external systems.

**Session Definitions**: Sessions group related user events within time boundaries, with Amplitude providing default session logic while supporting custom session definitions for advanced use cases.

## Integration Ecosystem

**Data Ingestion**: The platform supports multiple ingestion methods including various SDKs (JavaScript, iOS, Android, etc.), HTTP V2 API, Batch API, and third-party integrations like Segment. Domain proxy configurations enable routing events through custom domains for enhanced control.

**Third-Party Integrations**: Amplitude integrates with collaboration tools including Slack for notifications and chart unfurling, Atlassian products (Confluence, Jira) via Smart Links, Notion for chart embedding, Miro for visual collaboration, and Google Workspace through the Sync to Drive and Sheets extension.

**Marketing Analytics**: Out-of-the-box marketing analytics provides channel classification, attribution modeling (first-touch and last-touch), and UTM parameter tracking with automated Daily Ad Metrics events for comprehensive marketing performance analysis.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Core APIs**: The platform exposes REST APIs including the Dashboard REST API for programmatic access to dashboard data, Releases API for tracking product changes, Group Identify API for account-level instrumentation, and HTTP V2/Batch APIs for event ingestion.

**SDK Configuration**: Various SDKs support configuration options like `serverUrl`, `apiEndpoint`, and `setServerUrl()` functions for custom routing and domain proxy implementations.

**Instrumentation Debugging**: The platform provides debugging tools including the Ingestion Debugger for monitoring requests and throttled users, User Lookup for analyzing event streams, and the Chrome Instrumentation Explorer extension for Browser SDK debugging.

The platform operates on tiered pricing plans (Starter, Plus, Growth, Enterprise) with feature availability varying by plan level, particularly for advanced features like account-level reporting, anomaly detection, and enhanced collaboration controls.
