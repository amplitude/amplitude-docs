Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that enables organizations to track, analyze, and understand user behavior through event-based data collection and sophisticated reporting capabilities. The platform provides both individual user-level and account-level analytics, with advanced features for cohort analysis, anomaly detection, forecasting, and collaborative data exploration.

## Core Product Architecture and Features

**Analytics Foundation**: The platform centers around event-based tracking with multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, and Pathfinder for user journey mapping. The system supports both web and mobile analytics through various SDKs, with specialized features like Session Replay for qualitative analysis of user interactions.

**Account-Level Reporting**: The Accounts add-on enables group-level analytics beyond individual users, supporting up to five group types per project with both event-level and user-level group associations. This functionality integrates with Salesforce and other enterprise systems through the Group Identify API, HTTP V2 API, and Batch API.

**Behavioral Cohorts and Segmentation**: Users can create dynamic behavioral cohorts based on user actions within specific time periods, with advanced features like behavior offset for comparing behaviors across different time windows. The platform supports both static cohorts (imported via CSV) and dynamic cohorts that automatically update based on defined criteria.

**AI and Machine Learning**: Ask Amplitude provides a conversational AI interface using Amazon Bedrock LLM API for natural language chart creation and data exploration. The Anomaly + Forecast feature uses Prophet-based algorithms to detect statistical anomalies and predict trends across time-series data with configurable confidence intervals.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Group Types and Values**: In account-level reporting, group types represent categories of accounts (e.g., "company") while group values are specific instances (e.g., "Amplitude Inc"). Groups can be associated at the event level or user level.

**Historical Count**: A specialized filter that tracks the Nth instance (up to 5th) of user actions with a one-year lookback period, applicable across Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Pathfinder, and Retention Analysis.

**Microscope**: An interactive feature for drilling down into chart data points to view user streams, create cohorts, access session replays, and analyze conversion drivers.

**Behavioral Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments based on shared traits and actions within specific time periods, with support for complex temporal parameters (during, since, within) and logical operators.

**Channel Classifiers**: Marketing analytics components that apply sequential rules to determine marketing channels for individual events using UTM parameters and referrer values.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

**Collaboration and Sharing**: The platform integrates extensively with workplace tools including Slack (for notifications and chart unfurling), Atlassian products (Smart Links for Confluence and Jira), Notion (chart embedding), Miro (analytics plug-in), and Google Workspace (Sync to Drive and Sheets extension).

**Data Management**: Amplitude provides comprehensive debugging tools including the Ingestion Debugger for monitoring requests and events, User Lookup for analyzing individual user profiles, and the Chrome Instrumentation Explorer extension for Browser SDK debugging.

**Content Organization**: Spaces enable team collaboration with permission hierarchies (can edit/add/view), while dashboards support templates, filtering, subscriptions, and various export formats (CSV, PDF, PNG). The platform includes Chart Cleanup for bulk management and organizational-level metrics.

**External Integration**: Domain proxy services allow routing events through custom domains, while public links and embed codes enable external sharing with password protection and expiration controls.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Core APIs**: 
- Group Identify API for account-level reporting
- HTTP V2 API and Batch API for event ingestion
- Identify API for user property management
- Dashboard REST API for Google Workspace integration
- Releases API for automated release tracking

**SDK Configuration**: Multiple SDKs support serverUrl configuration for domain proxy setups, with specific endpoints like api2.amplitude.com for event collection and httpapi endpoints for various integrations.

**Marketing Analytics**: Out-of-the-box marketing analytics provides pre-configured tracking for Traffic by Channel, Traffic by Campaign, Ad Performance, Page Engagement, and Conversion metrics, with automated Daily Ad Metrics events and UTM parameter configuration.

## Advanced Analytics Capabilities

**Insights and Alerting**: The Insights feature uses Prophet machine learning for anomaly detection with automatic alerts for instrumented events, custom alerts with confidence intervals, and smart alerts for Event Segmentation and Funnel Analysis charts supporting daily/hourly frequencies.

**Root Cause Analysis**: Available on Growth and Enterprise plans, RCA investigates anomalous data points by scanning event properties in batches of thirty and generating time-series comparisons against baseline data.

**Templates and Standardization**: The platform supports dashboard templates organized by use case (funnel analysis, feature adoption) and industry (B2B SaaS, FinTech, E-commerce), with Find & Replace functionality for parameter updates across template instances.

The platform operates on a tiered plan structure (Starter, Plus, Growth, Enterprise) with feature availability varying by plan level, particularly for advanced features like account-level reporting, behavioral cohorts, and AI-powered analytics capabilities.
