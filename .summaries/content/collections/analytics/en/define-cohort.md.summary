**Summary:** This documentation explains how to define behavioral cohorts in Amplitude Analytics, covering event-based conditions (count, relative count, total sum of property, distinct values, historical count, count in interval), temporal parameters (during, since, within), logical operators (and/or clauses), user property conditions (most recently, any time), and group-level cohort creation.
