**Summary:** This documentation covers Amplitude's Root Cause Analysis (RCA) feature for investigating anomalous data points in Event Segmentation charts by analyzing event properties and external context like holidays and product releases. The feature is available on Growth and Enterprise plans, requires the Insights add-on for Growth users, and works by scanning event properties in batches of thirty to generate time-series graphs comparing anomalous events to baseline data.
