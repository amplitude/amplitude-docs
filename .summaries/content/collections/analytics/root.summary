Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that enables organizations to track, analyze, and understand user behavior across their digital products. The platform provides sophisticated event tracking, user segmentation, and behavioral analysis capabilities designed to help product teams make data-driven decisions.

## Core Product Architecture

Amplitude Analytics operates on a multi-layered architecture centered around events, users, and groups. The platform captures user interactions as events, which can be analyzed at individual user levels or aggregated into group-level analyses through the Accounts add-on. The system supports both real-time and historical data analysis, with configurable retention periods and data processing pipelines.

The platform's data model revolves around three primary entities: events (user actions), user properties (attributes describing users), and group properties (attributes describing organizations or accounts). Events are timestamped with multiple time references including client_event_time, server_received_time, and calculated event_time to ensure accurate temporal analysis.

## Key Features and Capabilities

### Analytics Charts and Visualization
Amplitude provides multiple chart types for different analytical needs:
- **Event Segmentation charts** for measuring event volumes and user engagement
- **Funnel Analysis** for conversion tracking and drop-off analysis
- **Retention Analysis** for measuring user return behavior
- **User Sessions** for session-based metrics
- **Pathfinder** for user journey mapping
- **Journeys charts** for path analysis

### Account-Level Reporting
The Accounts add-on enables group-level analytics instead of individual user reporting. Organizations can define up to five group types per project, with groups instrumented through various methods including SDKs, Identify API, HTTP API, Segment integration, and Group Identify API. This supports both event-level groups (dynamic assignment) and user-level groups (persistent association).

### Behavioral Cohorts and Segmentation
The platform offers sophisticated user segmentation through behavioral cohorts, which group users based on shared traits and actions within specific time periods. The Segmentation Module supports complex cohort definitions with temporal parameters (during, since, within), logical operators (and/or clauses), and various counting methods including relative count, total sum of property, distinct values, and historical count.

### Anomaly Detection and Forecasting
Amplitude's Anomaly + Forecast feature uses Prophet-based algorithms to detect statistically significant deviations in time-series data. The system offers three modes (agile, robust, custom) with configurable confidence intervals and training data durations ranging from 120-365 days.

### Marketing Analytics
The platform includes comprehensive marketing analytics capabilities with channel classifiers that apply sequential rules to determine marketing channels, attribution models (first-touch and last-touch), and out-of-the-box marketing metrics including Traffic by Channel, Ad Performance, Page Engagement, and Conversion tracking.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events**: Timestamped user actions tracked within the application, forming the foundation of all analytics
**User Properties**: Attributes describing individual users (e.g., subscription tier, location)
**Group Properties**: Attributes describing organizations or accounts in account-level reporting
**Behavioral Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments based on actions and behaviors within specified timeframes
**Static Cohorts**: Fixed user lists imported via CSV or created from specific data points
**Historical Count**: Feature tracking the Nth instance (up to 5th) of user actions with one-year lookback
**Microscope**: Data inspection tool for drilling into chart data points and accessing user streams
**Session Replay**: Qualitative recordings of user sessions synchronized with event streams
**Spaces**: Collaboration feature for organizing and sharing content with team-based permissions
**Dashboards**: Collections of charts, cohorts, and metrics for comprehensive reporting
**Notebooks**: Analytical reports combining charts, text, and metrics for storytelling

## Integration Ecosystem

Amplitude integrates extensively with external platforms and tools:

### Development and Instrumentation
- Multiple SDKs for various platforms and languages
- HTTP V2 API and Batch API for server-side integration
- Domain proxy support for routing events through custom domains
- Chrome Instrumentation Explorer extension for debugging Browser SDK events

### Collaboration Platforms

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

The platform exposes several key APIs:
- **HTTP V2 API** (`api2.amplitude.com`) for event ingestion
- **Identify API** for user property updates and group associations
- **Group Identify API** for group property management
- **Batch API** for bulk data operations
- **Dashboard REST API** for programmatic dashboard access
- **Releases API** for automated release tracking

Command-line and SDK configurations include:
- `serverUrl` configuration for custom domain routing
- `apiEndpoint` options for various SDK implementations
- OAuth authentication flows for external integrations
- Embed code generation for external sharing

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Analytics serves as the central analytics hub within a broader product ecosystem. The platform connects with experimentation tools through experiment results charts, integrates with feature flag systems for user targeting, and supports session replay analysis for qualitative insights. The Insights add-on provides automated anomaly detection and alerting, while the Growth and Enterprise plans offer enhanced collaboration features, advanced permissions, and extended data retention.

The platform's template system enables reusable analytical frameworks across use cases (funnel analysis, feature adoption, session engagement) and industries (B2B SaaS, FinTech, E-commerce), promoting analytical consistency and best practices across organizations.
