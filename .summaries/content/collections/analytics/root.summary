Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform designed to help organizations track, analyze, and understand user behavior across digital products. The platform combines individual user-level analytics with sophisticated account-level reporting capabilities, offering a complete solution for both B2C and B2B analytics use cases.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform operates on a multi-layered architecture built around three fundamental concepts: events, users, and groups. Events represent user actions, users represent individual actors, and groups enable account-level analysis for B2B scenarios. Data flows through multiple ingestion pathways including the HTTP V2 API, Batch API, and Identify API, supported by SDKs for Android, iOS, JavaScript, and web browsers. The system processes this data through real-time ingestion pipelines with built-in validation and debugging capabilities.

The analytical foundation centers on a comprehensive chart ecosystem, with Event Segmentation serving as the primary analysis tool. This is complemented by specialized visualization types including Funnel Analysis for conversion tracking, Retention Analysis for lifecycle understanding, User Sessions for engagement metrics, and Pathfinder (Journeys) for user path exploration. These charts integrate seamlessly with behavioral cohorts, which segment users based on shared traits and actions within defined time periods.

## Product Features and Relationships

**Analytics and Visualization Layer**: Event Segmentation charts provide trend analysis and user behavior insights, while Funnel Analysis tracks conversion rates through multi-step processes. Retention Analysis reveals user lifecycle patterns, and User Sessions deliver engagement metrics with configurable timeout periods. The Pathfinder feature maps user journeys through product experiences. All charts support advanced filtering, segmentation, and can be enhanced with machine learning-powered Anomaly + Forecast detection using Prophet algorithms.

**Account-Level Reporting**: The Accounts add-on extends the platform's capabilities to group-level analytics, supporting up to 5 group types per project. This enables B2B organizations to analyze behavior at the company, team, or organizational level. Group associations can occur at both event and user levels, with dynamic group properties supported through Salesforce integration. The Group Identify API enables real-time updates to group properties using operations like $set, $setOnce, $add, $append, and $unset.

**Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing**: Spaces organize teams and projects, while Dashboards aggregate key metrics for stakeholder consumption. Notebooks provide analytical storytelling capabilities, combining charts, text, and insights into shareable reports. The platform supports external sharing through public links and embed codes, with native integrations to Slack, Confluence, Jira, Notion, Miro, and Google Workspace.

**Data Quality and Debugging**: The Ingestion Debugger monitors event flow and identifies data quality issues. User Lookup enables detailed individual user analysis. The Chrome Instrumentation Explorer extension validates Browser SDK implementation. These tools work together to ensure proper instrumentation and data integrity.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events and Properties**: Events capture user actions with associated event properties providing contextual information. User properties describe individual user characteristics, while group properties (in account-level reporting) describe organizational or account attributes.

**Cohorts**: Behavioral cohorts dynamically group users based on shared actions within specified time periods, supporting complex temporal parameters (during, since, within) and logical operators. Static cohorts contain predefined user lists imported from external sources.

**Groups and Group Types**: Group types define categories of accounts (e.g., "company", "team"), while group values represent specific instances within those categories. Groups enable account-level analysis and can be associated at both event and user levels.

**Sessions**: Defined as periods of user activity with configurable timeout periods. Session metrics include entries, exits, totals, and duration calculations, particularly valuable for marketing analytics.

**Historical Count**: A specialized filter tracking the Nth instance (up to 5th) of user actions with a one-year lookback period, enabling analysis of user behavior patterns over time.

**Attribution Models**: Marketing analytics supports first-touch and last-touch attribution models for crediting marketing channels with conversion events, using configurable lookback windows.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Analytics integrates extensively with marketing technology stacks through UTM parameter tracking and channel classifiers, providing out-of-the-box marketing analytics including CAC, ROAS, CTR, and CPC metrics. The platform supports development workflows through Releases tracking with semantic versioning, feature flag integration, and A/B testing capabilities.

Data governance is maintained through Amplitude Data integration for tracking plan management, providing schema change notifications and validation workflows. Enterprise requirements are addressed through domain proxy configurations, BAA compliance options, and comprehensive administrative controls.

Session Replay functionality adds qualitative analysis through synchronized video recordings of user sessions, with 90-day retention and integration across chart types. This feature supports web applications and mobile native apps, though with limitations on canvas elements.

Ask Amplitude provides conversational AI interfaces using OpenAI's LLM API for natural language chart creation and data exploration, while maintaining specific data sharing policies for enterprise compliance.

## API Endpoints and Technical Integration

**Primary APIs**:
- **HTTP V2 API** (api2.amplitude.com): Primary event ingestion endpoint
- **Batch API**: Bulk event processing for high-volume scenarios
- **Identify API**: User property updates with groups key support
- **Group Identify API**: Account-level property management
- **Dashboard REST API**: External access to dashboard and chart data
- **Releases API**: Programmatic release tracking

**Technical Configuration**: The platform supports domain proxy configurations for routing events through custom domains, with NGINX configuration examples and SDK endpoint customization options. All SDKs support endpoint customization for enterprise deployment scenarios.

**Advanced Features**: Machine learning capabilities include anomaly detection and forecasting using Prophet algorithms. The platform provides comprehensive debugging tools including real-time event validation, user journey tracking, and instrumentation verification through browser extensions and API debugging interfaces.
