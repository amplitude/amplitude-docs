- **Templates**: Reusable dashboard configurations with parameters
- **Releases**: Timeline markers tracking product changes

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Analytics integrates with:

1. **Other Amplitude Products**:
   - **Amplitude Data**: For tracking plan and schema management
   - **Amplitude Experiment**: For A/B testing and feature flagging

2. **External Systems**:
   - Marketing tools via UTM parameter tracking
   - CRM systems like Salesforce for account reporting
   - Collaboration tools (Slack, Atlassian, etc.)

## Technical Implementation

### API Endpoints
- **HTTP V2 API**: Primary endpoint for sending events (`api2.amplitude.com`)
- **Identify API**: For updating user properties
- **Group Identify API**: For managing group properties

### SDK Implementation Examples
```javascript
// JavaScript SDK for group-level tracking
amplitude.getInstance().setGroup('account_id', '15'); 
amplitude.getInstance().logEventWithGroups('Button Clicked', 
  {buttonColor: 'blue'}, 
  {account_id: '15'}
);

// Group Identify API usage
amplitude.getInstance().groupIdentify('account_id', '15', 
  new amplitude.Identify().set('plan', 'enterprise')
);
```

### Domain Proxy Configuration
```nginx
# NGINX proxy configuration
location /amplitude/ {
  proxy_pass https://api2.amplitude.com/;
  proxy_set_header Host api2.amplitude.com;
  proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
}
```

## Plan Limitations

Features are distributed across different plan tiers:
- **Plus Plan**: Limited to five behavioral cohorts
- **Growth Plan**: Adds templates, Root Cause Analysis, Session Replay, external sharing
- **Enterprise Plan**: Includes all features with maximum capabilities

Some features like Ask Amplitude have additional privacy considerations, including limited data sharing with OpenAI's API and BAA limitations.
