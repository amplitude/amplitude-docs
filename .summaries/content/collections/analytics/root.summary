Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform built on an event-driven architecture that enables organizations to track, analyze, and understand user behavior through sophisticated analytical tools and AI-powered insights.

## High-Level Product Overview

The platform operates on event-based data collection where user interactions are captured as events with associated properties. Core capabilities include individual user-level and account-level reporting, multiple visualization types, collaborative analysis features, and machine learning-powered anomaly detection. The system supports both real-time and historical analysis with up to one-year lookback periods for behavioral tracking.

Key use cases span product optimization, user journey analysis, marketing attribution, account-based analytics, and cross-functional collaboration through integrated reporting and sharing capabilities.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The platform's analytical foundation centers on multiple interconnected chart types:
- **Event Segmentation**: Core event tracking and property analysis
- **Funnel Analysis**: Conversion pathway optimization
- **Retention Analysis**: User engagement and churn measurement  
- **User Sessions**: Session-based behavioral analysis
- **Pathfinder and Journeys**: User flow visualization and path discovery

These charts integrate with advanced analytical modules including the **Segmentation Module** for behavioral cohorts, **Session Replay** for qualitative session recordings, and **Anomaly + Forecast** using Prophet algorithms for predictive analytics.

The **Accounts add-on** extends individual user analytics to group-level analysis, enabling B2B account-based reporting through group types and group values. This creates a dual-layer analytics approach supporting both user-centric and account-centric perspectives.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Groups and Account-Level Reporting**: Group types (up to five per project) and group values enable account-level analytics. Event-level groups associate events with accounts, while user-level groups associate users with accounts through the Group Identify API.

**Behavioral Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments based on shared behaviors within specific time periods, supporting complex conditions including event counting methods (count, relative count, total sum of property, distinct values, historical count), temporal parameters (during, since, within), and logical operators.

**Historical Count**: Tracks the Nth instance (up to 5th) of user actions with one-year lookback, applied last in filter order except for Event Historical Count which applies first.

**Microscope**: Data inspection tool enabling detailed chart data point analysis with user stream viewing, cohort creation, and session replay integration.

**Spaces**: Collaboration framework with permission levels (can edit/add/view) and content organization, supporting shortcuts for multi-space content sharing.

**Ask Amplitude**: AI conversational interface using Amazon Bedrock LLM for natural language chart creation and editing.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Analytics integrates extensively with collaboration and productivity ecosystems through native connections to Slack, Notion, Miro, Google Drive/Sheets, and Atlassian products (Confluence, Jira, Trello). The **Dashboard REST API** enables Google Drive integration and external data export.

Marketing analytics capabilities connect through **Out-of-the-box Marketing Analytics** with UTM parameter tracking and channel attribution models. The platform supports external stakeholder engagement through public links, embed codes, and various export formats (CSV, PDF, PNG).

Content management operates through interconnected components: dashboards for metric visualization, notebooks for mixed-content analytical reports, templates for reusable frameworks, and spaces for organizational collaboration.

## API Endpoints and Technical Integration

**Primary APIs:**
- **HTTP V2 API**: Event ingestion at `api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`
- **Group Identify API**: Account-level group property management
- **Identify API**: User property updates  
- **Batch API**: Bulk event processing
- **Dashboard REST API**: External data export and Google Drive integration

**Domain Proxy Configuration**: NGINX `proxy_pass` directives enable organizations to relay events through custom domains rather than directly to Amplitude servers.

**Amazon Bedrock LLM API**: Powers Ask Amplitude conversational analytics with controlled metadata sharing for data governance.

## Advanced Analytics and AI Capabilities

**Anomaly + Forecast** employs Prophet-based algorithms with configurable confidence intervals (95%, 98%, 99%) and training data durations (120-365 days). Supports agile, robust, and custom detection modes with automated project alerts across multiple chart types.

**Insights** provides automated anomaly detection with machine learning, supporting automatic alerts for events with 100+ daily volume and custom alerts with various confidence intervals.

**Root Cause Analysis** investigates data anomalies through systematic analysis of contributing factors and dimensional breakdowns.

## Plan-Based Feature Distribution

Features distribute across tiered plans with specific limitations:
- **Starter**: 50 dashboard limit
- **Plus**: 5 behavioral cohort limit, manual release creation  
- **Growth/Enterprise**: Enhanced permissions, automated release detection, advanced analytics
- **Enterprise**: Official dashboard designation, enhanced space controls

The platform maintains 90-day default retention for Session Replay data and supports comprehensive content lifecycle management through **Chart Cleanup** functionality for organizational-level bulk chart management with filtering by owner, space, and project.
