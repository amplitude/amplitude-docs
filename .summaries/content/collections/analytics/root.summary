# Amplitude Analytics Product Ontology

Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that enables organizations to track, analyze, and understand user behavior through event-based data collection and sophisticated analytical tools. The platform provides both individual user-level and account-level reporting capabilities, with advanced features for cohort analysis, anomaly detection, and collaborative analytics workflows.

## Core Product Architecture and Features

### Analytics Foundation
The platform centers around event-based analytics with multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, and Pathfinder for user journey mapping. The system supports both real-time and historical data analysis with configurable time ranges and intervals. Charts can be organized into dashboards, shared externally via public links or embed codes, and integrated into collaborative workflows through Notebooks for analytical reporting.

### Account-Level Reporting System
Amplitude's Accounts add-on enables group-level analytics beyond individual user tracking. This system supports up to 5 group types per project with event-level and user-level group associations. Implementation occurs through multiple APIs including the Group Identify API for group property management, HTTP V2 API with event-level groups, and integration with Segment for group calls. The system includes dynamic group properties with Salesforce integration and supports up to 1,000 account-level properties per project.

### Behavioral Cohorts and Segmentation
The platform provides sophisticated user segmentation through behavioral cohorts that group users based on shared traits and actions within specific time periods. Cohorts can be created through multiple methods: Microscope for static/behavioral cohorts from data points, CSV import for static cohorts, and inline creation within the Segmentation module. Advanced features include behavior offset for analyzing behaviors across distinct time periods, rolling windows, and cohort population tracking over time through dynamic behavioral cohorts.

### Machine Learning and Anomaly Detection
Amplitude incorporates Prophet-based algorithms for anomaly detection and forecasting across time-series data. The Anomaly + Forecast feature operates in agile, robust, and custom modes with configurable confidence intervals and training data durations. The Insights alerts system provides automatic anomaly detection for instrumented events with smart alerts for Event Segmentation and Funnel Analysis charts. Root Cause Analysis (RCA) automatically investigates anomalous data points by analyzing event properties and comparing them to baselines.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

The analytics platform operates as an interconnected ecosystem where core chart types serve as building blocks for more complex analytical workflows. Event Segmentation charts form the foundation for cohort creation through Microscope, while Funnel Analysis integrates with Historical Count tracking to measure conversion patterns. The Pathfinder feature connects user journey analysis with Session Replay recordings, providing both quantitative flow analysis and qualitative session insights.

Account-level reporting extends individual user analytics by aggregating data across group hierarchies, enabling B2B organizations to analyze customer accounts alongside individual user behaviors. This dual-layer approach allows for comprehensive analysis from individual touchpoints to enterprise-wide engagement patterns.

Collaborative features bridge analytical insights with organizational workflows through Spaces for content organization, Notebooks for analytical storytelling, and extensive third-party integrations. The template system standardizes analytical approaches across teams while maintaining flexibility for custom analysis requirements.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Group Types and Values
- **Group Types**: Categories for organizing accounts (maximum 5 per project)
- **Group Values**: Specific identifiers within group types for individual accounts
- **Event-level Groups**: Group associations applied to individual events
- **User-level Groups**: Group associations applied to user profiles

### Cohort Classifications
- **Behavioral Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments based on actions and traits within time periods
- **Static Cohorts**: Fixed user lists imported via CSV or created from specific data points
- **Inline Cohorts**: Cohorts created directly within chart analysis workflows

### Historical Count System
- **Historical Count**: Tracks the Nth instance (up to 5th) of user actions with one-year lookback
- **Event Historical Count**: Applied first in filter operations before other constraints
- **Conversion Windows**: Time periods for measuring funnel progression in Historical Count analyses

### Attribution Models
- **First-touch Attribution**: Credits the first marketing channel in the conversion path
- **Last-touch Attribution**: Credits the final marketing channel before conversion
- **Channel Classifiers**: Sequential rules determining marketing channels for individual events

### Chart Types and Analysis Methods
- **Event Segmentation**: Core chart type for measuring event frequency and user engagement
- **Funnel Analysis**: Conversion tracking through sequential user actions
- **Retention Analysis**: User return behavior measurement over time periods
- **Pathfinder**: User journey mapping and flow visualization
- **User Sessions**: Session-based behavioral analysis

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Analytics operates as the central hub in a comprehensive product intelligence ecosystem. The platform integrates deeply with data infrastructure through multiple ingestion APIs, supporting both real-time event streaming and batch processing workflows. Browser and mobile SDKs provide client-side data collection while server-side APIs enable backend event tracking.

The collaboration ecosystem extends analytics insights into organizational workflows through integrations with Slack, Atlassian products (Confluence, Jira), Notion, Miro, and Google Workspace. These integrations transform analytical insights into actionable business intelligence across product development, marketing, and customer success teams.

Session Replay functionality bridges quantitative analytics with qualitative user experience insights, providing synchronized event streams with actual user session recordings. This integration enables comprehensive user behavior analysis from high-level metrics to granular interaction patterns.

The platform's machine learning capabilities, including Prophet-based forecasting and automated anomaly detection, position it as an intelligent analytics system that proactively identifies significant changes in user behavior and business metrics.

## API Endpoints and Technical Integration
