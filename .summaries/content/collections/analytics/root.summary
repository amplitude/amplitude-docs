Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that enables organizations to track, analyze, and understand user behavior across digital products through sophisticated event-based analytics, advanced segmentation, cohort analysis, and collaborative features designed for data-driven product teams.

## Core Product Architecture

Amplitude Analytics operates on an event-driven architecture where user interactions are captured as events with associated properties. The platform supports both individual user analysis and account-level reporting through the Accounts add-on, which enables group-level analytics for analyzing aggregated units like companies, accounts, or other organizational structures rather than individual users.

The platform integrates multiple analysis modules including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Pathfinder, and specialized features like Session Replay for qualitative user behavior analysis. These modules work together to provide comprehensive user journey insights from acquisition through retention.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

**Advanced Analytics Charts**: The platform offers multiple interconnected chart types including Event Segmentation for tracking user actions over time, Funnel Analysis for conversion tracking, Retention Analysis for user stickiness measurement, and User Sessions for engagement analysis. Each chart type supports sophisticated filtering, grouping, and comparison capabilities that can be cross-referenced and combined for deeper insights.

**Behavioral Cohorts**: Users can create dynamic behavioral cohorts that group users based on shared traits and actions within specific time periods. The platform supports up to five group types per project and includes features like behavior offset for analyzing user behaviors across distinct time periods, and cohort population tracking over time. These cohorts integrate seamlessly with all chart types for segmented analysis.

**Account-Level Reporting**: Through the Accounts add-on, organizations can perform group-level analytics using the Group Identify API, enabling analysis of business accounts, order IDs, or other aggregate units. This includes group-level funnel analysis, behavioral cohorts, and dynamic group properties with a limit of 1000 properties per group type.

**Anomaly Detection and Forecasting**: The Anomaly + Forecast feature uses Prophet-based algorithms to detect statistically significant deviations in time-series data across multiple chart types, offering configurable confidence intervals and training data durations with agile, robust, and custom modes.

**Collaboration and Sharing**: Amplitude provides extensive collaboration features through Spaces for team organization, Notebooks for analytical reporting with mixed content, and comprehensive sharing capabilities including public links, embed codes, and dashboard subscriptions with automated email/Slack notifications.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events and Properties**: Events represent user actions (e.g., "Button Clicked", "Page Viewed") while properties are attributes that provide context (e.g., button_name, page_url). The platform distinguishes between event properties (specific to individual events) and user properties (persistent attributes of users).

**Groups and Group Types**: In account-level reporting, group types define categories of aggregation (e.g., "Company", "Team") while group values are specific instances within those types (e.g., "Amplitude Inc", "Marketing Team"). Organizations can define up to five group types per project.

**Cohorts**: Static cohorts contain fixed user lists, while behavioral cohorts dynamically include users based on defined criteria. Cohorts can be created through Microscope data point inspection, CSV import, or inline within chart analysis.

**Historical Count**: A specialized filter that tracks the Nth instance (up to 5th) of user actions with a one-year lookback period, enabling analysis of user behavior patterns over time.

**Sessions**: Amplitude defines sessions as periods of user activity, with session-based metrics including entries, exits, and totals used particularly in marketing analytics for channel attribution analysis.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates extensively with external platforms and tools, positioning itself as a central hub in the modern data stack. The platform supports domain proxy configurations for routing events through custom domains, and provides comprehensive SDK support for various platforms.

**Third-Party Platforms**: Native integrations with Slack for notifications and chart sharing, Google Workspace through the Sync to Drive and sheets extension, Atlassian Smart Links for Confluence and Jira, Notion for chart embedding, and Miro for collaborative analysis.

**Data Integration**: Support for Segment integration (both Actions and Classic), Salesforce sync for account-level data, and various API endpoints for comprehensive data ingestion and management.

**Development Tools**: Chrome Instrumentation Explorer extension for debugging Browser SDK events, Ingestion Debugger for monitoring requests and validation, and comprehensive API documentation for custom integrations.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

The platform provides multiple API endpoints for data ingestion and management:

- **HTTP V2 API**: Primary endpoint for event ingestion (`api2.amplitude.com`)
- **Batch API**: For bulk event processing
- **Identify API**: For user property updates
- **Group Identify API**: For account-level property management
- **Dashboard REST API**: For programmatic dashboard and chart access
- **Releases API**: For tracking product releases and version changes

Command-line and programmatic access is supported through various SDK configurations including `setServerUrl()` functions, `apiEndpoint` options, and proxy configuration parameters for custom domain routing.

## Advanced Analytics Features

**Marketing Analytics**: Out-of-the-box marketing analytics provides centralized tracking with UTM parameter support, channel classifiers for attribution, and both first-touch and last-touch attribution models. The platform includes Daily Ad Metrics events and comprehensive campaign performance tracking.

**Product Analytics**: Pre-configured views track user engagement metrics including active users, retention intervals, onboarding funnels, and feature engagement matrices with customizable settings for active events and breakdown properties.

**Root Cause Analysis**: Available with the Insights add-on, this feature automatically analyzes anomalous data points by examining event properties and comparing them to baselines, supporting batch scanning of up to 30 properties.

**Session Replay**: Provides qualitative user session recordings for web applications that sync with event streams, accessible through various chart types and User Lookup with 90-day default retention.

The platform supports multiple pricing tiers (Starter, Plus, Growth, Enterprise) with feature availability varying by plan level, particularly for advanced features like account-level reporting, anomaly detection, and enhanced collaboration controls.
