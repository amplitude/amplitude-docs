Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform designed to track, analyze, and understand user behavior across web and mobile applications. The platform serves both individual user-level and account-level analytics needs, providing advanced capabilities for cohort analysis, anomaly detection, and collaborative data exploration across organizations.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform operates on a multi-layered architecture built around three fundamental components: events, users, and groups. Amplitude supports both traditional user-centric analytics and account-level reporting through the Accounts add-on, enabling sophisticated B2B group-level analysis. The system processes data through multiple ingestion methods including HTTP V2 API, Batch API, Identify API, and Group Identify API, alongside comprehensive SDKs for Android, iOS, JavaScript, and Browser implementations. Instrumentation validation is supported through tools like the Ingestion Debugger and Chrome Instrumentation Explorer extension.

The data model centers on events with associated properties, user properties, and group properties. The platform supports up to 5 group types per project and accommodates 1000 account-level properties. Analysis capabilities span multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, and specialized views like Journeys (Pathfinder) and Microscope for granular user stream examination.

## Key Features and Product Relationships

**Analytics Charts and Visualization**: Amplitude provides comprehensive chart types tailored for specific analytical needs. Event Segmentation enables trend analysis, Funnel Analysis tracks conversion processes, Retention Analysis examines user lifecycle patterns, and User Sessions measure engagement metrics. Advanced features include Historical Count (tracking up to the 5th instance of user actions), Anomaly + Forecast capabilities using Prophet algorithms, and seamless behavioral cohort integration across all chart types.

**Cohorts and Segmentation**: The platform delivers sophisticated user segmentation through behavioral cohorts that group users based on shared traits and actions within defined time periods. Cohorts can be created through multiple pathways: Microscope data point drilling, CSV import for static cohorts, inline creation within charts, and behavioral definitions with complex event-based conditions including count, relative count, total sum of property, and distinct values.

**Account-Level Reporting**: The Accounts add-on transforms analytics from individual user reporting to group-level insights, supporting both event-level and user-level group associations. This includes Salesforce integration for dynamic group properties, Group Identify API for property operations ($set, $setOnce, $add, $append, $unset), and specialized group behavioral cohorts.

**Collaboration and Sharing**: Amplitude emphasizes collaborative analytics through Spaces for team organization, Notebooks for analytical reporting combining text, charts, and metrics, and extensive sharing capabilities including public links, embed codes, and integrations with Slack, Notion, Miro, Google Drive/Sheets, and Atlassian tools.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events and Properties**: Events represent discrete user actions with associated properties. The platform distinguishes between event properties (specific to individual events) and user properties (persistent user attributes). Special events include `[Amplitude] Page Viewed` for web analytics and Daily Ad Metrics for marketing attribution analysis.

**Groups and Group Types**: Groups represent accounts or organizations within the system. Group types define categories (e.g., "company", "team") while group values represent specific instances. Event-level groups associate individual events with accounts, whereas user-level groups associate entire users with accounts.

**Cohorts**: Behavioral cohorts are dynamic user segments based on actions and properties, contrasting with static cohorts which represent fixed user lists. Cohorts support temporal parameters (during, since, within) and logical operators (and/or clauses) for complex segmentation logic.

**Sessions**: Amplitude defines sessions as periods of continuous user activity, with configurable session definitions and comprehensive metrics including session entries, exits, totals, and duration calculations.

**Attribution Models**: The platform supports first-touch and last-touch attribution models for marketing analytics, utilizing channel classifiers that apply sequential rules to determine marketing channels from UTM parameters and referrer values.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Analytics integrates comprehensively across the broader product ecosystem through multiple integration channels:

**Data Integration**: The platform connects with Segment (both Actions and Classic destinations), Salesforce for dynamic group properties, and various advertising networks for marketing attribution. Domain proxy services enable event routing through custom domains instead of direct api2.amplitude.com connections.

**Collaboration Tools**: Deep integrations include Slack (link unfurling, notifications, team spaces), Google Workspace (Drive sync, Sheets export), Notion (chart embedding), Miro (chart integration), and Atlassian products (Smart Links for Confluence and Jira).

**Development and Debugging**: Chrome Instrumentation Explorer extension supports Browser SDK debugging, User Lookup enables event stream analysis, and comprehensive API documentation facilitates custom implementations.

**Advanced Analytics**: Integration with Amplitude Data for tracking plan management, Amplitude Experiment for A/B testing analysis, Feature Flags for feature adoption tracking, and Session Replay for qualitative user behavior analysis.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Core APIs**: HTTP V2 API handles event ingestion, Batch API processes bulk data, Identify API manages user property updates, Group Identify API handles account-level property management, and Dashboard REST API enables programmatic chart access.

**SDK Configuration**: Multiple SDKs support custom endpoint configuration through parameters including `serverUrl`, `apiEndpoint`, and `setServerUrl()` functions for domain proxy implementations.

**Authentication and Access**: OAuth integration supports Google services, Atlassian authentication enables Smart Links functionality, and comprehensive permission systems provide organizational, project, and content-level access controls.

The platform operates across tiered subscription plans (Starter, Plus, Growth, Enterprise) with varying feature restrictions and limits, including cohort limitations, advanced analytics feature availability, and collaboration capability access levels.
