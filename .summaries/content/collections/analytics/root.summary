Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that enables organizations to track, analyze, and understand user behavior through event-based data collection and sophisticated reporting capabilities. The platform provides both individual user-level and account-level analytics, with advanced features for cohort analysis, anomaly detection, forecasting, and collaborative data exploration.

## Core Product Architecture and Features

Amplitude Analytics operates on an event-driven architecture where user interactions are captured as events with associated properties. The platform supports both individual user analytics and account-level reporting through the Accounts add-on, which enables group-level analyses for B2B use cases. The system processes data through multiple APIs including the HTTP V2 API, Batch API, Identify API, and Group Identify API, with specialized endpoints like `/2/httpapi` for event ingestion.

The platform's visualization layer consists of multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Pathfinder, and Journeys charts. These charts can be organized into dashboards, which support templating, filtering, subscription-based reporting, and external sharing capabilities. The system also provides specialized views like Out-of-the-box Marketing Analytics and Product Analytics that offer pre-configured metrics for common use cases.

Advanced analytical capabilities include the Anomaly + Forecast feature using Prophet-based algorithms for statistical anomaly detection, Root Cause Analysis (RCA) for investigating data irregularities, and Historical Count functionality for tracking the Nth instance of user actions. The platform integrates machine learning through features like Ask Amplitude (conversational AI interface using Amazon Bedrock LLM API) and automated Insights alerts for proactive monitoring.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Groups and Account-Level Reporting**: Group types and group values enable account-level analytics, with support for up to five group types per project. Event-level groups associate events with accounts at ingestion time, while user-level groups persist associations across user sessions.

**Cohorts**: Behavioral cohorts segment users based on shared traits and actions within specific time periods, supporting complex temporal parameters (during, since, within) and logical operators. Static cohorts contain fixed user lists, while dynamic cohorts automatically update based on defined criteria.

**Sessions**: Amplitude defines sessions as periods of user activity, with session-based metrics including session entries, exits, totals, bounce rate, and session duration. Custom session definitions are supported for most features except Session Replay.

**Attribution Models**: The platform supports first-touch and last-touch attribution models for marketing analytics, with channel classifiers applying rules to individual events at query time using UTM parameters and referrer values.

**Spaces**: Collaborative workspaces that organize content with hierarchical permissions (can edit/add/view), where project-level permissions override space-level permissions.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Analytics integrates extensively with external platforms and tools. Marketing integrations include Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and comprehensive UTM parameter tracking for CAC and ROAS calculations. The platform connects with collaboration tools through Slack integration (chart unfurling, notifications, dashboard subscriptions), Atlassian Smart Links (Confluence, Jira, Trello), Notion embedding, and Miro board integration.

Data governance features include the Ingestion Debugger for real-time event monitoring, User Lookup for individual user analysis, and the Chrome Instrumentation Explorer extension for Browser SDK debugging. The platform supports domain proxy configurations for routing events through custom domains instead of directly to api2.amplitude.com.

Enterprise features include official dashboard designation, enhanced space controls for Growth and Enterprise plans, and specialized data export capabilities through Google Drive Sync and various API endpoints. The system maintains different feature availability across Starter, Plus, Growth, and Enterprise tiers, with some advanced features requiring specific add-ons like the Insights package.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

Key API endpoints include the HTTP V2 API for event ingestion, Group Identify API for account-level data association, and the Dashboard REST API for external integrations. The platform supports various SDK configurations with customizable serverUrl and apiEndpoint options for different deployment scenarios.

Session Replay functionality captures web application recordings with 90-day default retention, synchronizing with event streams and supporting integration through Microscope views. The feature has limitations including web-only support and exclusion of canvas/WebGL elements.

The platform's data processing includes sophisticated timestamp handling with client_event_time, server_received_time, and calculated event_time fields, applying 60-second cutoff rules for timestamp adjustments. Advanced features like Historical Count apply specific filter order operations, with Historical Count filters applied last while Event Historical Count filters are applied first in the processing pipeline.
