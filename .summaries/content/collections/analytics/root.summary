## Product Relationships and Architecture

### Data Collection and Processing Flow
1. **Event Tracking**: Foundation of analytics, capturing user interactions via SDKs or APIs
2. **User and Group Identification**: Associates events with individual users and/or groups
3. **Property Tracking**: Captures additional context about events, users, and groups

### Analytics Hierarchy
1. **Events**: Individual user actions tracked in the system
2. **Users**: Individuals identified by unique IDs who perform events
3. **Groups**: Collections of users (accounts, organizations) for B2B analysis
4. **Cohorts**: Segments of users defined by specific behaviors or properties
5. **Charts**: Visualizations of event data based on specific metrics and segments
6. **Dashboards**: Collections of charts organized around specific themes
7. **Notebooks**: Interactive documents combining charts, text, and media
8. **Spaces**: Organizational units for sharing and collaborating on analytics content

### Plan Tiers
- **Plus**: Basic features with limitations (e.g., five behavioral cohorts maximum)
- **Growth**: Expanded features including Session Replay, Root Cause Analysis, and Templates
- **Enterprise**: Full feature set with advanced capabilities and customizations

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Analytics Concepts
- **Event**: Specific user action tracked in Amplitude (page view, button click, etc.)
- **User Property**: Attributes associated with users (demographics, preferences)
- **Group Property**: Attributes associated with groups like accounts or organizations
- **Cohort**: Segment of users defined by specific behaviors or properties
- **Behavioral Cohort**: Cohort defined by actions users have taken
- **Static Cohort**: Fixed list of user IDs imported into the system
- **Historical Count**: Tracks user behavior for different instances of specific actions

### Analysis Types
- **Event Segmentation**: Analysis of event trends over time with various segmentations
- **Funnel Analysis**: Visualization of user progression through a sequence of events
- **Retention Analysis**: Measurement of how users continue to engage over time
- **Pathfinder**: Visualization of the paths users take through a product
- **Microscope**: Tool for analyzing specific data points in charts by hovering over them

### Collaboration Features
- **Spaces**: Organizational units for sharing analytics content with specific teams
- **Personal Space/Workspace**: Private area for individual users to access their analyses
- **Official Dashboard**: Designated source of truth for specific metrics
- **Templates**: Reusable dashboard configurations for common analyses

## API Endpoints and Integration Methods

### Data Collection APIs
- **HTTP V2 API**: Primary endpoint for sending events (`api2.amplitude.com`)
- **Identify API**: Updates user properties without sending events
- **Group Identify API**: Updates group properties

### SDK Integration Options
- **Browser/JavaScript SDK**: For web applications
- **Android SDK**: For Android applications
- **iOS SDK**: For iOS applications
- **Server-side SDKs**: For backend implementations

### Third-Party Integrations
