Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that enables organizations to track, analyze, and understand user behavior across their digital products through sophisticated event-based analytics, advanced segmentation, cohort analysis, and behavioral insights.

## Core Product Architecture

Amplitude operates on an event-driven architecture where user interactions are captured as events with associated properties. The platform supports multi-level analysis including individual user analytics and account-level reporting through the Accounts add-on for B2B use cases, tracking up to five group types per project for both user and organizational-level analysis.

The system integrates through multiple APIs: HTTP V2 API (`api2.amplitude.com`), Batch API, Identify API, Group Identify API, Dashboard REST API, and Releases API. Integration support extends to Segment (Actions and Classic destinations), Salesforce with daily sync, and various third-party platforms. Domain Proxy Configuration enables organizations to relay events through their own domains using NGINX proxy configurations.

## Analytics Features and Chart Types

**Event Segmentation Charts** form the analytical foundation, measuring event volumes, user counts, and property aggregations over time. These support Historical Count filtering (tracking up to the 5th instance of user actions), anomaly detection via Prophet algorithms, and Root Cause Analysis for investigating data anomalies.

**Funnel Analysis** tracks conversion across multi-step user journeys with Historical Count filters, conversion driver analysis through Microscope, and behavioral cohort integration.

**Retention Analysis** monitors user return behavior with configurable intervals and calendar alignment options supporting rolling and fixed time windows.

**User Sessions Analytics** provides session-based metrics including duration, entries, exits, and engagement patterns for marketing analytics.

**Pathfinder** offers user journey visualization and path analysis, though with limitations on account-level reporting and Historical Count filters.

## Advanced Analytics Capabilities

**Behavioral Cohorts** enable dynamic user segmentation based on actions and properties within specific time periods. The platform supports event counting methods (count, relative count, total sum of property, distinct values, historical count, count in interval), temporal parameters (during, since, within), and user property conditions. Cohorts can be created through Microscope, CSV import, or inline chart interfaces.

**Anomaly Detection and Forecasting** uses Prophet-based machine learning with three modes (agile, robust, custom), configurable confidence intervals, and training data durations of 120-365 days.

**Marketing Analytics** features channel classifiers applying sequential rules for marketing channel determination, attribution models (first-touch and last-touch), and out-of-the-box metrics for page engagement, traffic analysis, and conversion performance.

## Data Investigation and Quality Tools

**Microscope** enables detailed chart data point inspection with access to user streams, path analysis, cohort creation, and session replay integration for drilling down from aggregate metrics to individual behavior.

**User Lookup** provides comprehensive user profiles including event streams, session replays, cohort memberships, experiment participation, and feature flag exposure. The system handles complex timestamp calculations including client_event_time, server_received_time, and event_time computations.

**Debugging Tools** include the Ingestion Debugger for real-time data flow monitoring, throttled users tracking, and Chrome Instrumentation Explorer extension for Browser SDK debugging.

## Collaboration and Sharing Infrastructure

**Spaces** provide team-based collaboration with hierarchical permission management (can edit/add/view), content organization, and Slack integration. The system supports content shortcuts for multi-space sharing with project-level permissions overriding space-level permissions.

**Dashboards** serve as centralized analytics hubs supporting mixed content (charts, cohorts, Session Replays) with commenting functionality, official designation for Enterprise plans, template creation, and export formats (CSV, PDF, PNG). Dashboard subscriptions enable automated HTML email reports and Slack notifications.

**Notebooks** provide analytical reporting with mixed content support (text blocks, charts, videos, metrics), drag-and-drop editing, markdown formatting, and chart callouts for comprehensive analysis documentation.

## Integration Ecosystem

**Slack Integration** provides chart link unfurling, comment notifications, tracking plan updates, and team space notifications.

**Google Workspace** integration through Sync to Drive and Sheets extension enables chart data export to Google Sheets and chart images to Google Slides.

**Atlassian Smart Links** support chart preview embedding in Confluence documents and Jira tickets.

**Miro Integration** allows direct chart embedding through the Amplitude plug-in.

**Notion Integration** enables chart embedding through URL pasting with authentication flow.

**Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server** at `https://mcp.amplitude.com/v1/mcp` enables conversational AI analysis through 17 specialized tools including query_chart, query_metric, and various get operations.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Group Types and Group Values**: Core concepts for account-level reporting where group types represent categories (e.g., "company") and group values represent specific instances (e.g., "Amplitude Inc.").

**Event-Level vs User-Level Groups**: Event-level groups associate specific events with groups, while user-level groups associate users with groups across all events.

**Historical Count**: Specialized filter tracking the Nth instance (up to 5th) of user actions with one-year lookback period.

**Behavioral vs Static Cohorts**: Behavioral cohorts dynamically update based on user actions; static cohorts contain fixed user lists typically imported via CSV.

**Channel Classifiers**: Sequential rules determining marketing channels for events based on UTM parameters and referrer values.

**Attribution Models**: Methods for crediting acquisition touchpoints including first-touch and last-touch attribution with configurable lookback windows.

## Plan-Based Feature Distribution

**Starter Plans** include basic analytics with limitations like 50 dashboard maximum.

**Plus Plans** add behavioral cohorts (5 cohort limit), advanced sharing, and manual release creation.

**Growth Plans** provide enhanced collaboration controls, automated release detection, anomaly detection, and Root Cause Analysis with Insights add-on.

**Enterprise Plans** include all features plus official dashboard designation, advanced permissions, and enhanced security controls.

The platform maintains specific limitations including 90-day Session Replay retention, web-only Session Replay support, exclusion of canvas/WebGL elements from recordings, and account-level reporting supporting up to 1000 account-level properties with 5 group types limit per project.
