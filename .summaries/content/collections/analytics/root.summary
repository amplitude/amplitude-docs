# Amplitude Analytics Product Overview

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that helps businesses understand user behavior, track product performance, and make data-driven decisions. It combines quantitative and qualitative analytics capabilities to provide deep insights into how users interact with digital products.

The platform offers a wide range of analytics capabilities including event segmentation, funnel analysis, retention analysis, user path visualization, behavioral cohort creation, anomaly detection, and forecasting. It also provides robust collaboration features through dashboards, notebooks, spaces, and templates.

Advanced features include account-level reporting for B2B companies, session replay for watching actual user interactions, a conversational AI interface (Ask Amplitude), root cause analysis for anomalies, marketing analytics, and pre-built dashboards for common use cases.

## Product Relationships and Features

Amplitude Analytics consists of several interconnected components:

1. **Data Collection Layer**:
   - SDKs for various platforms (Android, iOS, JavaScript)
   - Server-side APIs (Identify API, HTTP API)
   - Third-party integrations (e.g., Segment)
   - Domain proxy option for custom routing

2. **Data Processing and Storage Layer**:
   - Event processing pipeline
   - User and group property management
   - Behavioral cohort computation

3. **Analysis and Visualization Layer**:
   - Interactive chart creation
   - Dashboard building
   - Notebook authoring
   - Template management

4. **Collaboration and Distribution Layer**:
   - Spaces for team organization
   - Permission management
   - Integrations with tools like Slack, Miro, Notion, Google Drive

The platform offers different plan tiers (Plus, Growth, Enterprise) with varying feature availability. For example, the Plus plan limits users to five behavioral cohorts, while the Growth plan adds features like Releases, Root Cause Analysis, and Session Replay. The Enterprise tier provides the full feature set with advanced capabilities.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Core Analytics Concepts
- **Event**: A discrete user action tracked in Amplitude
- **User Property**: Attributes associated with individual users
- **Group Property**: Attributes associated with groups of users (accounts, organizations)
- **Cohort**: A collection of users who share common characteristics or behaviors
- **Session**: A period of continuous user activity, defined by configurable timeout settings
- **Microscope**: Feature for analyzing specific data points in charts

### Group Analytics Terminology
- **Event-Level Groups**: Temporary associations between users and groups for specific events
- **User-Level Groups**: Permanent associations between users and groups
- **Group Types**: Categories of groups (e.g., accounts, organizations, teams)

### Analysis Types
- **Event Segmentation**: Analysis of specific events and their properties
- **Funnel Analysis**: Tracking user progression through a sequence of events
- **Retention Analysis**: Measuring continued user engagement over time
- **Pathfinder**: Visualizing user navigation paths through a product
- **Historical Count**: Tracking specific instances (1st, 2nd, etc.) of user actions

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Analytics integrates with other Amplitude products and third-party tools:

### Amplitude Product Suite
- **Amplitude Experiment**: A/B testing and feature flagging platform
- **Amplitude CDP**: Customer data platform for unified user profiles
- **Amplitude Data**: Tracking plan and data governance tools

### Third-Party Integrations
- **Collaboration Tools**: Slack, Miro, Notion, Atlassian products, Google Drive
- **Data Sources**: Segment, Salesforce, and other data platforms
- **Marketing Platforms**: Various attribution and campaign management tools

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

### Key API Endpoints
- **HTTP V2 API**: `https://api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi` for sending events
- **Identify API**: `https://api2.amplitude.com/identify` for updating user properties
- **Group Identify API**: For creating and updating group properties

### SDK Implementation Examples
```javascript
// JavaScript
amplitude.getInstance().logEvent("event_name", {property: "value"});

// iOS
Amplitude.instance().logEvent("event_name", withEventProperties: ["property": "value"]);

// Android
Amplitude.getInstance().logEvent("event_name", JSONObject properties);
```

### Domain Proxy Configuration
```
location /amplitude/ {
    proxy_pass https://api2.amplitude.com/;
    proxy_set_header Host api2.amplitude.com;
}
```

The platform's advanced features include behavioral cohorts for segmenting users based on actions, account-level reporting for B2B analytics, anomaly detection with configurable sensitivity levels, and session replay for viewing recorded user interactions with synchronized event streams.
