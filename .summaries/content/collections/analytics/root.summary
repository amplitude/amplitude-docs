Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that enables organizations to track, analyze, and understand user behavior through event-based data collection and sophisticated analytical tools. The platform provides both individual user-level and account-level reporting capabilities, with advanced features for cohort analysis, anomaly detection, and collaborative analytics workflows.

## Core Product Architecture and Features

### Analytics Foundation
The platform centers around event-based analytics with multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, User Sessions, Retention Analysis, Pathfinder, and Journeys. These charts support various visualization modes (charts, KPIs, tables) and can be organized into dashboards for comprehensive reporting. The system uses semantic versioning for release tracking and provides automated instrumentation through SDKs for Android, iOS, JavaScript, and server-side APIs.

### Account-Level Reporting System
Amplitude's Accounts add-on enables group-level analytics through a sophisticated group types system (limited to 5 per project). Organizations can implement either event-level or user-level groups using the Group Identify API, HTTP V2 API, Batch API, or Segment integration. This system supports dynamic group properties with Salesforce integration and allows for account-level behavioral cohorts and funnel analysis.

### Behavioral Cohorts and Segmentation
The platform provides extensive user segmentation through behavioral cohorts that group users based on shared traits and actions within specific time periods. Cohorts can be created through multiple methods: Microscope data point analysis, CSV imports (supporting user IDs or Amplitude IDs up to 50MB), or inline creation within the Segmentation module. The system supports complex cohort definitions with event counting methods (count, relative count, total sum of property, distinct values, historical count), temporal parameters (during, since, within), and logical operators.

### Advanced Analytics Capabilities
Amplitude incorporates machine learning through its Anomaly + Forecast feature using Prophet-based algorithms for detecting statistical anomalies across time-series data. The platform offers Historical Count tracking for analyzing the Nth instance (up to 5th) of user actions with a one-year lookback period. Root Cause Analysis (RCA) automatically investigates anomalous data points by analyzing event properties and comparing them to baselines.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Core Analytics Terms
- **Event Segmentation**: Primary chart type for analyzing event frequency and user behavior patterns
- **Funnel Analysis**: Conversion tracking through sequential user actions with conversion windows
- **Behavioral Cohorts**: Dynamic user groups based on shared behaviors and traits within time periods
- **Historical Count**: Feature tracking the Nth instance of user actions across various chart types
- **Microscope**: Data inspection tool for drilling into chart data points and creating cohorts
- **Session Replay**: Qualitative user session recordings synchronized with event streams (90-day retention)

### Group and Account Analytics
- **Group Types**: Categories for organizing account-level data (5 per project limit)
- **Group Values**: Specific identifiers within group types for account classification
- **Event-level Groups**: Groups associated with individual events for granular analysis
- **User-level Groups**: Groups associated with user profiles for broader account tracking
- **Dynamic Group Properties**: Real-time updating account attributes through Salesforce integration

### Collaboration and Sharing
- **Spaces**: Collaborative workspaces for organizing and sharing analytics content
- **Notebooks**: Mixed-content analytical reports combining charts, text, and metrics
- **Templates**: Reusable dashboard configurations with Find & Replace functionality
- **Breadcrumbs**: Analysis evolution tracking for creating Notebooks from chart views

## Product Ecosystem Integration

### Data Infrastructure
Amplitude integrates with multiple data sources through its HTTP V2 API, Batch API, and Identify API endpoints. The platform supports domain proxy configurations for routing events through custom domains instead of api2.amplitude.com. Data validation occurs through the Ingestion Debugger, User Lookup, and Chrome Instrumentation Explorer extension for Browser SDK debugging.

### Third-Party Integrations
The platform provides extensive integration capabilities including:
- **Segment Integration**: Both Actions and Classic destinations with group calls and trait mapping
- **Salesforce Integration**: Dynamic group properties synchronization for account-level reporting
- **Slack Integration**: Link unfurling, comment notifications, and team space connections
- **Google Workspace**: Sync to Drive and Sheets extension using Dashboard REST API
- **Atlassian**: Smart Links for embedding chart previews in Confluence and Jira
- **Notion**: Chart embedding through URL pasting with authentication flow
- **Miro**: Direct chart embedding through marketplace plug-in

### Marketing Analytics Suite
The Out-of-the-box Marketing Analytics provides centralized tracking through four insight categories: Traffic by Channel, Traffic by Campaign, Ad Performance, Page Engagement, and Conversion. The system uses UTM parameters (utm_campaign, utm_content, utm_medium, utm_source, utm_term) and Daily Ad Metrics events for comprehensive marketing attribution using first-touch and last-touch models.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

### Core APIs
- **HTTP V2 API**: Primary event ingestion endpoint for real-time data collection
- **Batch API**: Bulk event processing for high-volume data ingestion
- **Identify API**: User property updates with groups key for account-level reporting
- **Group Identify API**: Account-level property management with operations ($set, $setOnce, $add, $append, $unset)
- **Dashboard REST API**: Chart data export and external integration support
- **Releases API**: Automated release tracking and version management

### SDK Configuration
Multiple SDKs support serverUrl configuration for domain proxy setups, with specific methods like setServerUrl() for JavaScript implementations and apiEndpoint options for various platform SDKs. The Browser SDK integrates with Autocapture events for Page Viewed and Element Clicked tracking.

## Plan-Based Feature Distribution

The platform operates on a tiered plan structure (Scholarship, Plus, Growth, Enterprise) with feature restrictions:
- **Plus Plans**: Limited to 5 behavioral cohorts, manual release creation
- **Growth/Enterprise**: Full feature access including automated release detection, enhanced space controls
- **Insights Add-on**: Required for Anomaly + Forecast and Root Cause Analysis features
- **Accounts Add-on**: Enables group-level reporting and account analytics capabilities

The system provides comprehensive administrative controls through Organization Settings for chart cleanup, subscription management, and content access permissions, with specific BAA compatibility restrictions for certain AI-powered features like Ask Amplitude.
