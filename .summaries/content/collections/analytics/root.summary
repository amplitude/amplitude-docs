## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Events**: User actions tracked in Amplitude (e.g., page views, button clicks)

2. **Properties**: Attributes associated with events or users

3. **Cohorts**: Groups of users sharing common behaviors or characteristics
   - Behavioral Cohorts: Dynamic groups based on user actions
   - Static Cohorts: Fixed groups based on imported user IDs

4. **Charts**: Visualizations of analytics data
   - Event Segmentation: Analysis of event frequency and properties
   - Funnel Analysis: Tracking user progression through sequential steps
   - Retention Analysis: Measuring user return rates over time

5. **Microscope**: Feature for detailed exploration of data points in charts

6. **Groups/Accounts**: 
   - Event-level groups: Temporary associations between users and groups
   - User-level groups: Permanent associations between users and groups

7. **Sessions**: Series of user events grouped by time and activity
   - Session Replay: Recorded visual playback of user sessions

8. **Historical Count**: Filter for tracking specific instances of user actions

9. **Spaces**: Organizational units for content management with permission controls

10. **Templates**: Reusable analysis frameworks with customizable parameters
