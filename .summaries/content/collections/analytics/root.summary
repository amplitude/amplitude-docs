Amplitude Analytics is a comprehensive product analytics platform that enables organizations to track, analyze, and understand user behavior through event-based data collection and sophisticated reporting capabilities. The platform provides both individual user-level and account-level analytics, with advanced features for cohort analysis, anomaly detection, forecasting, and collaborative data exploration.

## Core Product Architecture and Features

### Analytics Foundation
The platform centers around event-based analytics with multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Pathfinder, and Journeys. These charts support various visualization modes (charts, KPIs, tables) and can be organized into dashboards for comprehensive reporting. The system processes events through APIs (HTTP V2, Batch, Identify) and SDKs (Android, iOS, JavaScript, Browser SDK) with real-time ingestion capabilities.

### Account-Level Reporting System
Amplitude's Accounts add-on enables group-level analytics beyond individual users, supporting up to 5 group types per project with 1000 account-level properties. This system distinguishes between event-level groups (associated with specific events) and user-level groups (persistent user associations), implemented through the Group Identify API, HTTP API with event-level groups, and Segment integration with Group Type/Value Traits.

### Behavioral Cohorts and Segmentation
The platform provides sophisticated user segmentation through behavioral cohorts that group users based on shared traits and actions within specific time periods. Cohorts can be created through multiple methods: Microscope data point analysis, CSV imports with user/Amplitude IDs, and inline creation within the Segmentation module. The system supports complex cohort definitions with event counting methods (count, relative count, total sum of property, distinct values, historical count, count in interval) and temporal parameters (during, since, within clauses).

### Advanced Analytics Capabilities
Amplitude incorporates machine learning through its Anomaly + Forecast feature using Prophet-based algorithms to detect statistically significant deviations in time-series data. The platform offers Historical Count tracking for analyzing the Nth instance (up to 5th) of user actions with a one-year lookback period. Root Cause Analysis (RCA) automatically investigates anomalous data points by analyzing event properties and comparing them to baselines.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Group Types and Values**: Core components of account-level reporting where group types represent categories (e.g., "company") and group values represent specific instances (e.g., "Amplitude Inc.")

**Behavioral Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments based on actions and properties, distinguished from static cohorts which contain fixed user lists

**Historical Count**: Feature tracking the Nth occurrence of user actions, applied last in the filter order of operations (unlike Event Historical Count which applies first)

**Session Replay**: Qualitative recordings of web user sessions synchronized with event streams, limited to web applications with 90-day default retention

**Microscope**: Interactive data exploration tool allowing drill-down into specific chart data points for user stream analysis, cohort creation, and session replay access

**Spaces**: Collaboration framework for organizing and sharing content with permission levels (can edit/add/view) and integration with Slack for team notifications

**Out-of-the-Box (OOTB) Analytics**: Pre-configured analytics views including Marketing Analytics (UTM tracking, channel attribution) and Product Analytics (engagement, retention, onboarding funnels)

## Product Ecosystem Integration

### Data Infrastructure
The platform integrates with multiple data sources through domain proxy configurations, allowing organizations to relay events through their own domains instead of directly to api2.amplitude.com. The system supports various attribution models (first-touch, last-touch) with channel classifiers applying sequential rules for marketing channel determination.

### Third-Party Integrations
Amplitude provides extensive integration capabilities including:
- **Slack**: Link unfurling, comment notifications, dashboard subscriptions, and team space connections
- **Google Workspace**: Sync to Drive and Sheets extension using Dashboard REST API with OAuth authentication
- **Atlassian**: Smart Links for embedding chart previews in Confluence and Jira
- **Notion**: Chart embedding through URL pasting with authentication flow
- **Miro**: Direct chart embedding via marketplace plug-in
- **Segment**: Both Actions and Classic destination mapping for group calls and event tracking
- **Salesforce**: Dynamic group properties synchronization for account-level reporting

### Collaboration and Sharing
The platform emphasizes collaborative analytics through multiple sharing mechanisms: public links with password protection and expiration settings, embed codes for external stakeholders, dashboard subscriptions with HTML email reports and Slack PDF attachments, and Notebooks for creating analytical reports with mixed content including text blocks, charts, and metrics.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

### Core APIs
- **HTTP V2 API**: Primary event ingestion endpoint with batch processing capabilities
- **Identify API**: User property updates with `groups` key for account-level associations
- **Group Identify API**: Group property management with operations ($set, $setOnce, $add, $append, $unset)
- **Dashboard REST API**: Powers Google Sheets integration and external data access
- **Releases API**: Automated release tracking with semantic versioning support

### SDK Configuration
Multiple SDKs support endpoint configuration through parameters like `serverUrl`, `apiEndpoint`, and `setServerUrl()` functions, enabling domain proxy implementations and custom data routing.

### Advanced Features by Plan Tier
The platform operates on tiered pricing (Scholarship, Plus, Growth, Enterprise) with feature restrictions: Plus plans limit behavioral cohorts to five, Growth and Enterprise plans include advanced features like Anomaly + Forecast, Root Cause Analysis, and enhanced collaboration controls. The Accounts add-on and Insights add-on provide additional capabilities for group-level analytics and machine learning-powered anomaly detection respectively.

The platform's architecture supports both real-time analytics through live event updates and historical analysis through configurable retention periods, with specialized tools like the Ingestion Debugger, User Lookup, and Chrome Instrumentation Explorer extension for debugging and validation workflows.
