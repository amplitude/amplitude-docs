# Amplitude Retention Analysis

## Product Overview

Amplitude's Retention Analysis is a powerful analytics tool that helps product teams understand how often users return to their product after performing specific actions. The tool tracks user behavior over time by comparing a starting event to subsequent return events, allowing teams to measure user engagement and loyalty. Key features include multiple retention calculation methods, flexible time interval options, user segmentation capabilities, and usage interval analysis to understand natural product usage patterns.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Retention Analysis Chart

The Retention Analysis chart is the core visualization that displays how many users return to a product after performing a specific action. It allows product teams to:

- Track user retention across daily, weekly, or monthly intervals
- Compare different user segments
- Filter by event properties
- Analyze retention trends over time
- Identify patterns in user behavior

### Retention Calculation Methods

Amplitude offers three distinct methods for calculating retention:

1. **Return On or After** - Counts users who return at any point during or after a specific interval (cumulative)
2. **Return On** - Counts only users who return specifically during a given interval (non-cumulative)
3. **Return On Custom** - Allows custom configuration of return periods

### Time Calculation Options

Two approaches to time calculation affect how retention is measured:

1. **Rolling 24-hour Window** (default) - Starts when a user triggers the starting event
2. **Strict Calendar Dates** - Follows calendar days based on the project timezone

### Usage Interval Analysis

A specialized analysis that measures the time between occurrences of a critical event, helping teams understand natural usage patterns and set appropriate retention expectations based on product type.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Retention Analysis tool is part of Amplitude's broader analytics platform. It integrates with:

- Event tracking system to capture user actions
- Segmentation capabilities to analyze different user groups
- Filtering functionality to focus on specific behaviors
- Visualization components to present retention data

The tool processes event data to calculate retention metrics and presents them through interactive charts and data tables.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Starting Event**: The initial action that places users in a cohort for retention analysis
- **Return Event**: The action(s) that indicate a user has returned to the product
- **Cohort Entry Date**: The date when users first perform the starting event
- **Usage Interval**: The natural frequency at which users engage with a product (daily, weekly, monthly)
- **Retention Brackets**: Visual indicators in the retention chart showing retention percentage ranges
- **Median Frequency**: The middle value in the distribution of time intervals between events
- **Inflection Point**: A significant change in usage pattern that may indicate optimal engagement frequency
- **Day Zero Retention**: Retention measured on the same day as the starting event

## Building a Retention Analysis Chart

To build a Retention Analysis chart in Amplitude:

1. Select the starting event that defines your cohort
2. Choose the return event(s) that indicate user retention
3. Set the usage interval (daily, weekly, monthly)
4. Configure retention type (Return On or After, Return On, Return On Custom)
5. Apply any segmentation or filtering as needed
6. Select visualization options (retention view or change over time)

## Interpreting Retention Analysis

The Retention Analysis chart provides:

- A visual heatmap showing retention percentages over time
- A breakdown table with detailed retention numbers
- Options to view data as absolute retention or change over time
- Ability to compare retention across different user segments
- Insights into natural usage patterns through the Usage Interval view

## Usage Interval Analysis

To build a usage interval analysis:

1. Select a critical event in the Events Module
2. Configure the Measured As module to analyze the time between events
3. Apply segmentation or filtering as needed
4. Interpret the distribution of time intervals to understand natural usage patterns

The Usage Interval view requires events to occur on at least two different days and shows the percentage of active users who trigger selected events at specific frequencies.

## Time Calculation Methods

The choice between "rolling 24-hour window" and "strict calendar dates" affects how retention is calculated:

- **Rolling 24-hour Window**: Calculates intervals based on exact hours since the starting event
- **Strict Calendar Dates**: Uses calendar days based on the project timezone

These methods impact daily, weekly, and monthly retention calculations differently, with implications for how retention metrics are interpreted.
