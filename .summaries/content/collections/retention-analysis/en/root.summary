# Amplitude Retention Analysis

## Product Overview

Amplitude's Retention Analysis is a powerful analytics tool that helps product teams understand user engagement patterns over time. The product tracks how often users return to perform specific actions after an initial event, providing insights into user behavior, product stickiness, and long-term engagement. 

Key features include:
- Multiple retention calculation methods (Return On or After, Return On, Return On Custom)
- Usage interval analysis to understand natural product usage frequency
- Flexible segmentation and filtering options
- Visualization tools including charts and data tables
- Time-based analysis with different calculation methods

Primary use cases include measuring product stickiness, understanding natural usage patterns, identifying drop-off points, and optimizing user engagement strategies.

## Product Relationships and Features

Amplitude's Retention Analysis consists of several interconnected features:

1. **Standard Retention Analysis**: The core feature that tracks how users return to a product after a specific action by comparing:
   - Starting event: The initial action users take
   - Return event: The action that indicates a user has returned

2. **Usage Interval Analysis**: A specialized analysis that measures the time between occurrences of a critical event, focusing only on return events to understand natural usage patterns.

3. **Time Calculation Methods**:
   - Rolling 24-hour window: Starts when a user triggers the starting event
   - Strict calendar dates: Follows calendar days based on project timezone

4. **Visualization Options**:
   - Retention view: Shows percentage of users who return in each interval
   - Change over time view: Shows how retention changes across different cohorts

5. **Segmentation and Filtering**:
   - User segmentation: Analyze retention for specific user groups
   - Property filtering: Filter events based on specific properties

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Cohort Entry Date**: The date when users first perform the starting event, grouping them into cohorts for analysis.

- **Retention Types**:
  - **Return On or After**: Counts users who return at any point during or after a specific interval
  - **Return On**: Counts users who return specifically during a given interval
  - **Return On Custom**: Allows custom definition of return criteria

- **Usage Interval**: The time between occurrences of a critical event, measured as daily, weekly, or monthly.

- **Median Frequency**: The middle value in the distribution of how often users trigger an event.

- **Retention Calculation Components**:
  - **Numerator**: Number of users who performed both the starting and return events
  - **Denominator**: Total number of users who performed the starting event

- **Inflection Point**: The point at which user behavior patterns significantly change in usage interval analysis.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Retention Analysis integrates with other Amplitude features to provide a comprehensive analytics solution:

1. **Events Module**: Used to select the starting and return events for retention analysis.

2. **Measured As Module**: Configures how retention is calculated and displayed.

3. **Segmentation Module**: Allows breaking down retention by user segments.

4. **Microscope**: Provides detailed retention values for specific data points.

5. **Project Settings**: Determines timezone settings that affect strict calendar date calculations.

The retention analysis data can inform other Amplitude features and external product decisions by identifying engagement patterns, optimal feature release timing, and user behavior trends.

## Technical Implementation

To build a Retention Analysis in Amplitude:

1. Navigate to the Retention Analysis chart in Amplitude.

2. Configure the analysis using:
   - Events Module: Select starting and return events
   - Measured As module: Choose retention type (Return On or After, Return On, Return On Custom)
   - Segmentation Module: Add user segments if needed
   - Filter properties: Apply event property filters

3. For Usage Interval Analysis:
   - Select the critical event
   - Choose the appropriate time interval (daily, weekly, monthly)
   - Events must occur on at least two different days to be included

4. Time calculation options:
   - Set to either "rolling 24-hour window" or "strict calendar dates"
   - Configure daily, weekly, or monthly retention intervals

The resulting visualization provides both chart and table views of retention data, with options to export or further analyze specific data points.
