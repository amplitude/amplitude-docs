# Amplitude Retention Analysis

## Product Overview

Amplitude's Retention Analysis is a powerful analytics tool that helps product teams understand how often users return to their product after performing specific actions. The tool tracks user behavior over time by comparing starting events to return events, allowing teams to measure user engagement, identify usage patterns, and optimize product experiences for better retention.

Key features of Amplitude's Retention Analysis include:
- Multiple retention measurement methods (Return On or After, Return On, Return On Custom)
- Usage interval analysis to understand natural product usage patterns
- Flexible time calculations (24-hour windows or strict calendar dates)
- User segmentation and property filtering
- Visualization options including charts and detailed data tables

## Product Relationships and Features

Amplitude's Retention Analysis consists of several interconnected features:

1. **Retention Analysis Chart Building**
   - Configurable starting and return events
   - User segmentation capabilities
   - Property filtering
   - Multiple retention measurement methods

2. **Retention Calculation Methods**
   - Return On or After: Tracks if users return at any point after the specified interval
   - Return On: Tracks if users return specifically during the specified interval
   - Return On Custom: Allows custom return period definition

3. **Usage Interval Analysis**
   - Measures time between occurrences of a critical event
   - Shows percentage of active users at specific frequencies (daily, weekly, monthly)
   - Helps identify natural usage patterns and median frequency

4. **Time Calculation Options**
   - Rolling 24-hour windows (default)
   - Strict calendar dates
   - Different calculations for daily, weekly, and monthly retention

5. **Visualization and Interpretation Tools**
   - Retention charts
   - Breakdown tables
   - Change over time view
   - Retention brackets

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Starting Event**: The initial action that users perform to be included in a retention cohort.
- **Return Event**: The action that users must perform to be considered "retained" in subsequent time periods.
- **Cohort Entry Date**: The date when users first performed the starting event.
- **Usage Interval**: The time between occurrences of a critical event, showing natural product usage patterns.
- **Return On or After Retention**: Measures if users return at any point after the specified interval.
- **Return On Retention**: Measures if users return specifically during the specified interval.
- **Return On Custom Retention**: Allows custom definition of return periods.
- **Retention Brackets**: Visual indicators showing retention performance ranges.
- **Median Frequency**: The middle value in the distribution of time intervals between events.
- **Inflection Point**: The point at which retention patterns significantly change.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Retention Analysis is part of Amplitude's broader analytics platform, working alongside other analytics tools to provide comprehensive user behavior insights. While the documentation doesn't explicitly detail all integrations, it's clear that Retention Analysis:

- Connects with Amplitude's event tracking system to capture user actions
- Integrates with user segmentation capabilities
- Works with property filtering to refine analysis
- Complements other Amplitude analytics tools for a complete view of user behavior

## API and Command Line Usage

The documentation doesn't specifically mention API endpoints or command line invocations for Retention Analysis. The tool appears to be primarily accessed through Amplitude's web interface, where users can:

1. Build retention charts by selecting starting and return events
2. Configure measurement methods and time calculations
3. Apply segments and filters
4. View and interpret results through the provided visualization tools

The interface includes modules for Events, Segmentation, and Measurement configuration, allowing users to customize their retention analysis to meet specific analytical needs.
