# Amplitude Retention Analysis

## Product Overview

Amplitude's Retention Analysis is a powerful analytics tool that helps product teams understand how users engage with their products over time. The core functionality allows tracking how often users return to a product after performing specific actions, with flexible measurement options to accommodate different business models and product usage patterns.

Key features include:
- Multiple retention calculation methods (Return On or After, Return On, Return On Custom)
- Customizable time intervals (daily, weekly, monthly)
- User segmentation and property filtering
- Usage interval analysis for understanding natural product usage patterns
- Visualization options including charts and detailed data tables
- Time calculation options (rolling 24-hour windows vs. strict calendar dates)

## Product Relationships and Features

The Retention Analysis tool consists of several interconnected features:

1. **Retention Analysis Chart Building**: The core interface where users configure their analysis by selecting:
   - Starting events (the initial action users take)
   - Return events (the actions that indicate retention)
   - Segmentation options
   - Time intervals and calculation methods

2. **Retention Calculation Methods**:
   - **Return On or After**: Counts users who return any time during or after a specific interval
   - **Return On**: Counts users who return specifically during a given interval
   - **Return On Custom**: Allows custom interval definitions

3. **Usage Interval Analysis**: A specialized view that:
   - Measures the natural frequency between occurrences of critical events
   - Shows distribution of user behavior across daily/weekly/monthly patterns
   - Helps establish appropriate retention expectations based on product type

4. **Time Calculation Options**:
   - Rolling 24-hour windows (default)
   - Strict calendar dates
   - Different implications for daily, weekly, and monthly retention calculations

5. **Visualization and Interpretation Tools**:
   - Retention percentage view
   - Change over time view
   - Detailed breakdown tables
   - Cohort analysis capabilities

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Starting Event**: The initial action that places users in a cohort for retention analysis
- **Return Event**: The action that indicates a user has been "retained"
- **Cohort Entry Date**: The date when a user first performs the starting event
- **Retention Interval**: The time period for measuring retention (daily, weekly, monthly)
- **Return On or After Retention**: Cumulative retention that counts users who return in or after a specific interval
- **Return On Retention**: Discrete retention that only counts users who return during a specific interval
- **Usage Interval**: The natural time between occurrences of a critical event
- **Median Frequency**: The middle value in the distribution of time intervals between events
- **Inflection Point**: Where user behavior patterns change significantly in usage interval analysis
- **Microscope Denominator**: The specific cohort being analyzed in retention calculations

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Retention Analysis appears to be a core component of Amplitude's analytics platform, working alongside other analytics tools. While the documentation doesn't explicitly detail all integrations, it suggests:

1. Integration with Amplitude's broader event tracking and user segmentation capabilities
2. Ability to analyze events captured through Amplitude's data collection mechanisms
3. Compatibility with Amplitude's user segmentation features
4. Connection to other Amplitude visualization and analysis tools

## API and Implementation Details

The documentation focuses on the UI-based configuration rather than API endpoints, but mentions several key implementation components:

1. **Chart Configuration Modules**:
   - Events Module: For selecting starting and return events
   - Measured As Module: For choosing retention calculation methods
   - Segmentation Module: For filtering and segmenting users

2. **Chart Building Process**:
   1. Select starting event(s)
   2. Select return event(s)
   3. Choose retention type (Return On or After, Return On, Return On Custom)
   4. Select time interval (daily, weekly, monthly)
   5. Apply segmentation and filtering as needed
   6. View and interpret results

3. **Time Calculation Options**:
   - Default: Rolling 24-hour windows
   - Alternative: Strict calendar dates (configurable option)

The Retention Analysis tool provides a comprehensive way to understand user engagement patterns over time, with flexible configuration options to match different business models and product usage expectations.
