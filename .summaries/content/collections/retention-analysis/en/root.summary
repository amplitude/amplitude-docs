## Amplitude Retention Analysis

Amplitude's Retention Analysis is a comprehensive analytics tool designed to measure and analyze user return behavior patterns. The system enables product teams to understand how users engage with their applications over time by tracking when users return after performing initial actions. The analysis supports multiple measurement methodologies, time intervals, and segmentation capabilities to provide deep insights into user engagement and product stickiness.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

The Retention Analysis chart integrates with several core Amplitude modules to provide comprehensive user behavior analysis:

**Core Module Integration:**
- **Events Module**: Configures starting events (triggering events) and up to two return events for analysis
- **Segmentation Module**: Enables user segment filtering and property-based analysis
- **Microscope Feature**: Provides detailed breakdown tables and denominator value analysis for incomplete data scenarios
- **Lifecycle Chart**: Integrates with usage interval analysis for comprehensive user journey mapping

**Analysis Views:**
- **Retention View**: Standard cohort-based retention measurement
- **Change Over Time View**: Temporal analysis of retention pattern evolution
- **Usage Interval View**: Frequency-based analysis of user engagement patterns
- **Breakdown Table**: Tabular representation of retention data with weighted averages

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Retention Concepts:**
- **Starting Event/Triggering Event**: The initial user action that defines cohort entry
- **Return Event**: The subsequent action(s) used to measure user return behavior
- **Cohort Entry Date**: The timestamp when a user first performs the starting event
- **Usage Interval**: Time-based measurement of user engagement frequency

**Retention Measurement Types:**
- **Return On or After (Unbounded)**: Measures users who return on or after specified time intervals
- **Return On (N-Day)**: Measures users who return on exact specified days
- **Return On Custom**: Uses custom-defined time brackets for retention measurement

**Time-Based Definitions:**
- **Day Zero Retained**: Users who perform return events within the first 24-hour window
- **Next-Day Retained**: Users who return in subsequent daily intervals
- **Week Zero/Month Zero Retained**: Weekly and monthly equivalents of initial retention periods
- **24-Hour Window vs Calendar Dates**: Two distinct time calculation methodologies

**Analysis Components:**
- **Critical Event**: Events specifically measured in usage interval analysis
- **Median Frequency**: Statistical measure of user engagement patterns (daily/weekly/monthly)
- **Inflection Point**: Key moments in retention curves indicating behavior changes
- **Active/Inactive Events**: Event state classifications for analysis purposes

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The Retention Analysis system operates as a central component within Amplitude's analytics ecosystem, connecting user behavior measurement with broader product intelligence capabilities. The system integrates with timezone project settings for accurate temporal analysis and supports multiple cohort entry scenarios for complex user journey mapping.

The analysis framework supports both rolling time windows and strict calendar date calculations, enabling teams to choose measurement methodologies that align with their product's usage patterns. The integration with segmentation capabilities allows for sophisticated user group analysis, while property filtering enables granular behavior examination.

**Usage Interval Analysis Integration**: This specialized analysis type focuses exclusively on measuring time between return events (critical events), distinguishing it from standard retention analysis that measures time between starting and return events. This provides complementary insights into user engagement frequency and product usage patterns.

## Technical Implementation Details

**Time Calculation Methodology:**
- Timestamp rounding down to the nearest hour for consistent bucketing
- Support for both rolling 24-hour windows (default) and strict calendar dates
- Cohort bucketing based on project timezone settings
- Hourly vs daily basis calculations depending on analysis requirements

**Data Processing:**
- Incomplete data exclusion from denominator calculations in Microscope view
- Mathematical formulas for cohort entry date versus overall retention calculations
- Retention percentage calculations with automatic adjustment for data completeness
- Support for multiple cohort entries and new user retention filtering

**Analysis Requirements:**
- Events must occur on at least two different days for inclusion in usage interval analysis
- "Any Event" option available for broad behavioral analysis
- Grouped by functionality for organized event selection
- Property filtering through Performed event filters in tabular view results

The system provides weighted averages for retention calculations and supports custom retention brackets for specialized analysis scenarios, making it adaptable to diverse product analytics requirements across different industries and use cases.
