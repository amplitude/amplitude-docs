# Amplitude Retention Analysis

## Product Overview

Amplitude's Retention Analysis is a powerful analytics tool that helps product teams understand how often users return to their product after performing specific actions. The tool tracks user behavior over time by comparing starting events to return events, allowing teams to measure product stickiness, identify usage patterns, and optimize for user retention. 

Key features of Retention Analysis include:
- Multiple retention calculation methods (Return On or After, Return On, Return On Custom)
- Usage interval analysis to understand natural product usage frequency
- Flexible time calculations (24-hour windows or strict calendar dates)
- User segmentation and property filtering
- Visualization through charts and detailed data tables

## Product Relationships and Features

Retention Analysis in Amplitude consists of several interconnected features:

1. **Retention Analysis Chart Building**: The core feature allowing users to select starting events, return events, and configure how retention is measured.

2. **Retention Calculation Methods**:
   - **Return On or After**: Tracks if users return at any point after the specified interval
   - **Return On**: Tracks if users return specifically during the specified interval
   - **Return On Custom**: Allows custom configuration of return periods

3. **Usage Interval Analysis**: A specialized view that measures the time between occurrences of critical events, helping teams understand natural usage patterns.

4. **Time Calculation Options**: 
   - Rolling 24-hour windows (default)
   - Strict calendar dates

5. **Visualization and Interpretation Tools**:
   - Retention charts
   - Breakdown tables
   - Change over time view

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Starting Event**: The initial action that places users in a cohort for retention tracking
- **Return Event**: The action that indicates a user has returned to the product
- **Cohort Entry Date**: The date when a user first performs the starting event
- **Usage Interval**: The natural frequency at which users engage with a product (daily, weekly, monthly)
- **Retention Types**:
  - **Return On or After**: Counts users who return at any point after the specified interval
  - **Return On**: Counts users who return specifically during the specified interval
  - **Return On Custom**: Allows custom configuration of return periods
- **Median Frequency**: The middle value in the distribution of time intervals between events
- **Inflection Point**: The point at which retention patterns significantly change
- **Retention Brackets**: Time periods used to measure retention (e.g., Day 1, Day 7)

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Retention Analysis is part of Amplitude's broader analytics platform, integrating with:

1. **Event Tracking**: Relies on properly configured events to measure user actions
2. **User Segmentation**: Allows filtering retention analysis by user segments
3. **Property Filtering**: Enables filtering by event and user properties
4. **Microscope**: Provides detailed user-level data for retention analysis
5. **Data Visualization**: Presents retention data in charts and tables for interpretation

The tool is designed to work alongside other Amplitude features to provide a comprehensive view of user behavior and product performance.

## Technical Implementation

To build a Retention Analysis chart in Amplitude:

1. Navigate to the Retention Analysis chart in Amplitude
2. Configure the Events Module:
   - Select a starting event
   - Select return events (can be the same or different from starting event)
3. Set the Measured As module:
   - Choose between Return On or After, Return On, or Return On Custom
   - Select the time interval (daily, weekly, monthly)
4. Optional configurations:
   - Apply segmentation in the Segmentation Module
   - Filter by properties
   - Configure the Usage Interval view

For Usage Interval analysis:
1. Select the critical event in the Events Module
2. Configure the Measured As module to view frequency distribution
3. Analyze the median frequency and distribution of usage patterns

The platform calculates retention using specific formulas:
- For Return On or After: Users who return on or after day N ÷ Users who triggered the starting event
- For Return On: Users who return specifically on day N ÷ Users who triggered the starting event

Time calculations can be configured to use either rolling 24-hour windows or strict calendar dates, affecting how daily, weekly, and monthly retention is calculated.
