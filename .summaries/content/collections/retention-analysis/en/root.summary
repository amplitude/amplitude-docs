## Amplitude Retention Analysis

Amplitude's Retention Analysis is a comprehensive analytics tool that measures user return behavior and engagement patterns by tracking how users interact with specific events over time. The system provides multiple measurement methodologies to analyze user retention, usage patterns, and behavioral cohorts across daily, weekly, and monthly intervals.

## Product Relationships and Features

The Retention Analysis system integrates with several core Amplitude modules:

- **Events Module**: Defines starting events (triggering events) and return events for retention measurement
- **Segmentation Module**: Enables user segment filtering and property-based breakdowns
- **Microscope Feature**: Provides detailed denominator values and cohort-specific analysis
- **Lifecycle Charts**: Utilizes retention data for broader user journey analysis
- **Return On Custom Charts**: Leverages median return period calculations from usage interval analysis

The system supports comparison of up to two return events simultaneously and provides both tabular results view and visual chart representations with breakdown tables for detailed analysis.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Retention Concepts:**
- **Starting Event/Triggering Event**: The initial user action that defines cohort entry
- **Return Event**: The subsequent action measured for retention calculation
- **Critical Event**: Specific events used in usage interval analysis (return events only)
- **Cohort Entry Date**: The timestamp when users first trigger the starting event

**Retention Measurement Types:**
- **Return On or After (Unbounded)**: Measures if users return on or after specified intervals
- **Return On (N-Day)**: Measures exact-day return behavior using 24-hour windows or calendar dates
- **Return On Custom**: Uses custom time brackets for flexible retention measurement

**Time Calculation Methods:**
- **Rolling 24-Hour Windows**: Default method using hourly timestamp rounding
- **Strict Calendar Dates**: Alternative method using project timezone calendar boundaries
- **Usage Interval**: Time measurement between return events only (excluding starting events)

**Analysis Views:**
- **Retention View**: Standard cohort-based retention percentage display
- **Change Over Time View**: Temporal analysis of retention pattern evolution
- **Usage Interval View**: Median frequency analysis requiring events on at least two different days

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Retention Analysis system serves as a foundational component in Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem. It feeds data into Lifecycle chart creation through median return period calculations and supports Return On Custom chart configuration via usage interval insights. The system's cohort bucketing behavior handles multiple events per user and integrates with project-wide timezone settings for consistent temporal analysis.

The analysis supports the "Any Event" option for flexible event selection and provides weighted averages for retention calculations. Incomplete data is clearly marked with asterisk indicators, and the system excludes incomplete intervals from denominator calculations to maintain analytical accuracy.

## Technical Implementation

The retention calculation engine uses specific mathematical formulas:
- **Cohort-specific retention**: (Users who returned in interval N) / (Users in cohort who could have returned)
- **Overall retention**: Aggregated calculation across all cohorts with appropriate weighting
- **Usage interval frequency**: Median calculation requiring minimum two-day event occurrence

Time interval processing supports:
- **Daily retention**: 24-hour periods or calendar day boundaries
- **Weekly retention**: 7-day intervals starting from cohort entry
- **Monthly retention**: 30-day periods with appropriate calendar alignment

The system handles timezone conversion through project settings and provides both Day Zero/Week Zero/Month Zero baseline measurements and subsequent interval tracking (Day 1, Day 7, Day 30, etc.) for comprehensive retention analysis.
