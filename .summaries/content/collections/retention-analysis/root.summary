# Amplitude Retention Analysis

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude's Retention Analysis is a specialized analytics tool designed to measure and understand user engagement patterns over time. It tracks how frequently users return to a product after performing specific actions, enabling product teams to assess product stickiness, identify usage patterns, and optimize for improved user retention.

The tool offers multiple retention calculation methods, flexible time window configurations, user segmentation capabilities, and comprehensive visualization options. By comparing starting events to return events across different time intervals, teams can gain insights into natural product usage frequency and make data-driven decisions to improve user retention.

## Product Relationships and Features

Retention Analysis consists of several interconnected components:

1. **Chart Building Framework**: The core interface where users configure retention analysis parameters including starting events, return events, and measurement methods.

2. **Retention Calculation Methods**:
   - **Return On or After**: Tracks users who return at any point after a specified interval (cumulative retention)
   - **Return On**: Measures users who return specifically during a defined interval (discrete retention)
   - **Return On Custom**: Allows custom configuration of return periods for specialized analysis

3. **Usage Interval Analysis**: A specialized view that measures the time between occurrences of critical events, helping teams understand natural product usage patterns and frequency.

4. **Time Calculation Options**:
   - Rolling 24-hour windows (default) for more precise time-based analysis
   - Strict calendar dates for alignment with business reporting periods

5. **Visualization and Analysis Tools**:
   - Retention charts showing percentage of returning users over time
   - Detailed breakdown tables with cohort-specific data
   - Change over time view to track retention trend improvements

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Starting Event**: The initial action that places users in a cohort for retention tracking
- **Return Event**: The action that indicates a user has returned to the product
- **Cohort Entry Date**: The date when a user first performs the starting event
- **Usage Interval**: The natural frequency at which users engage with a product (daily, weekly, monthly)
- **Retention Types**:
  - **Return On or After**: Cumulative retention that counts users who return at any point after the specified interval
  - **Return On**: Discrete retention that counts users who return specifically during the specified interval
  - **Return On Custom**: Custom retention periods for specialized analysis
- **Median Frequency**: The middle value in the distribution of time intervals between events
- **Inflection Point**: The point at which retention patterns significantly change
- **Retention Brackets**: Time periods used to measure retention (e.g., Day 1, Day 7, Day 30)

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Retention Analysis is a core component of Amplitude's analytics platform, with several integration points:

1. **Event Tracking System**: Relies on properly configured events to measure user actions accurately
2. **User Segmentation Engine**: Allows filtering retention analysis by user segments for targeted insights
3. **Property Filtering**: Enables filtering by event and user properties to isolate specific behaviors
4. **Microscope Feature**: Provides detailed user-level data for deeper retention analysis
5. **Data Visualization Framework**: Presents retention data in charts and tables for interpretation

The tool works in conjunction with other Amplitude features to provide a comprehensive view of user behavior and product performance. It serves as a critical component for understanding long-term engagement patterns that complement other analytics views like funnels and pathfinding.

## Technical Implementation

To create a Retention Analysis chart in Amplitude:

1. Navigate to the Retention Analysis chart in the Amplitude interface
2. Configure the Events Module:
   - Select a starting event that defines the initial cohort
   - Select return events (can be the same or different from starting event)
3. Set the Measured As module:
   - Choose between Return On or After, Return On, or Return On Custom
   - Select the time interval (daily, weekly, monthly)
4. Optional configurations:
   - Apply segmentation in the Segmentation Module
   - Filter by properties to focus on specific user groups
   - Configure the Usage Interval view for frequency analysis

The platform calculates retention using specific formulas:
- For Return On or After: Users who return on or after day N ÷ Users who triggered the starting event
- For Return On: Users who return specifically on day N ÷ Users who triggered the starting event

Time calculations can be configured to use either rolling 24-hour windows or strict calendar dates, affecting how daily, weekly, and monthly retention is calculated and interpreted.
