## Amplitude Retention Analysis

Amplitude's Retention Analysis is a comprehensive analytics tool designed to measure and analyze user return behavior patterns over time. The product enables organizations to understand user engagement by tracking when users return after performing initial actions, supporting multiple measurement methodologies, time intervals, and segmentation capabilities to provide insights into user engagement and product stickiness.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

Retention Analysis integrates with several core Amplitude modules to provide comprehensive user behavior analysis:

**Core Module Integration:**
- **Events Module**: Configures starting events (triggering events) and up to two return events for analysis
- **Segmentation Module**: Enables user segment filtering and property-based analysis  
- **Measured As Module**: Specifically used for usage interval analysis configuration

**Chart Integration:**
- **Lifecycle Chart**: Works in conjunction with retention analysis for comprehensive user journey mapping
- **Microscope View**: Provides detailed breakdown tables with denominator values and cohort-specific data
- **Breakdown Tables**: Offer tabular representations of retention data with weighted averages

The product supports two primary analysis types: standard retention analysis (measuring time between starting and return events) and usage interval analysis (measuring time between return events only).

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Retention Concepts:**
- **Starting Event/Triggering Event**: The initial user action that begins the retention measurement period
- **Return Event**: The subsequent user action(s) used to measure retention behavior
- **Critical Event**: Specific events used in usage interval analysis to measure time between occurrences
- **Cohort Entry Date**: The date when users first trigger the starting event, used for grouping users into analysis cohorts

**Retention Measurement Types:**
- **Return On or After (Unbounded)**: Measures users who return on or after a specified time period
- **Return On (N-Day)**: Measures users who return on exactly the specified day/period
- **Return On Custom**: Uses custom-defined time brackets for retention measurement

**Time-Based Terminology:**
- **Day/Week/Month Zero Retained**: Users who perform return events within the initial time period
- **Usage Interval**: The time period between return event occurrences, measured as median frequency
- **24-Hour Window**: Rolling time periods vs. strict calendar date calculations
- **Timestamp Rounding**: Automatic rounding down to the nearest hour for cohort bucketing

**Analysis Views:**
- **Retention View**: Standard percentage-based retention measurement over time
- **Change Over Time View**: Comparative analysis showing retention rate changes
- **Usage Interval Over Time**: Displays median frequency of event triggering patterns

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Retention Analysis functions as a core component within Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem, leveraging the platform's foundational event tracking infrastructure and integrating with segmentation and filtering capabilities. Project timezone settings affect all time-based calculations, ensuring consistency across the analytics platform.

The analysis supports advanced filtering through "Performed event filters" and property-based segmentation for sophisticated user behavior analysis. The "Any Event" option provides flexibility in defining return behaviors, while "grouped by functionality" enables comparative analysis across different user segments or event categories.

## Technical Implementation Details

**Configuration Requirements:**
- Events must occur on at least two different days for inclusion in usage interval analysis
- Support for up to two return events in standard retention analysis
- Configurable time intervals: daily, weekly, and monthly measurements
- Multiple cohort entry support with automatic bucketing

**Calculation Methodologies:**
- Mathematical formulas for cohort-specific vs. overall retention calculations
- Incomplete data exclusion logic for accurate denominator calculations
- Median frequency calculations for usage interval analysis
- Weighted average calculations for aggregated retention metrics

**Time Calculation Options:**
- Default: Rolling 24-hour windows with hourly timestamp rounding
- Alternative: Strict calendar date calculations
- Timezone-aware calculations based on project settings
- Support for both hourly and daily basis calculations

The product includes sophisticated handling of incomplete data periods and provides inflection point analysis capabilities for identifying critical user behavior patterns, integrating seamlessly with Amplitude's broader analytics suite to provide essential insights for product teams focused on user engagement and retention optimization.
