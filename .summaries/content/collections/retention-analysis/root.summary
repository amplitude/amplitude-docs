# Amplitude Retention Analysis

## Product Overview

Amplitude Retention Analysis is an analytics tool designed to help product teams track and understand user engagement over time. It measures how frequently users return to a product after performing specific actions, providing insights into user loyalty and product stickiness. The tool enables teams to identify patterns in user behavior, optimize engagement strategies, and improve long-term user retention.

## Key Features and Concepts

- **Cohort-based analysis**: Track groups of users who performed a specific starting event and analyze their return behavior
- **Multiple retention calculation methods**: Choose between cumulative, non-cumulative, or custom return period measurements
- **Flexible time intervals**: Analyze retention on daily, weekly, or monthly bases
- **User segmentation**: Compare retention across different user groups
- **Usage interval analysis**: Understand natural product usage patterns to set appropriate retention expectations
- **Interactive visualization**: View retention data through heatmaps and detailed breakdown tables

## Product Relationships and Architecture

Retention Analysis is integrated within Amplitude's analytics platform ecosystem. It works by:

1. Capturing user actions through Amplitude's event tracking system
2. Processing this data to calculate retention metrics based on configured parameters
3. Presenting results through interactive visualizations and data tables

The tool connects with other Amplitude features including:
- Event tracking for capturing user actions
- Segmentation for analyzing different user cohorts
- Filtering for focusing on specific behaviors
- Visualization components for presenting retention data

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Starting Event**: The initial action that places users in a cohort for retention analysis
- **Return Event**: The action(s) that indicate a user has returned to the product
- **Cohort Entry Date**: When users first perform the starting event
- **Retention Calculation Methods**:
  - **Return On or After**: Counts users who return at any point during or after a specific interval (cumulative)
  - **Return On**: Counts only users who return specifically during a given interval (non-cumulative)
  - **Return On Custom**: Allows custom configuration of return periods
- **Time Calculation Options**:
  - **Rolling 24-hour Window**: Starts when a user triggers the starting event (default)
  - **Strict Calendar Dates**: Follows calendar days based on project timezone
- **Usage Interval**: Natural frequency at which users engage with a product
- **Retention Brackets**: Visual indicators showing retention percentage ranges
- **Median Frequency**: Middle value in the distribution of time intervals between events
- **Inflection Point**: Significant change in usage pattern indicating optimal engagement frequency
- **Day Zero Retention**: Retention measured on the same day as the starting event

## Building and Using Retention Analysis

To create a Retention Analysis chart:

1. Navigate to the Retention Analysis tool in Amplitude
2. Select the starting event that defines your cohort
3. Choose the return event(s) that indicate user retention
4. Set the usage interval (daily, weekly, monthly)
5. Configure retention type (Return On or After, Return On, Return On Custom)
6. Apply any segmentation or filtering as needed
7. Select visualization options (retention view or change over time)

For Usage Interval Analysis:
1. Select a critical event in the Events Module
2. Configure the Measured As module to analyze time between events
3. Apply segmentation or filtering as needed
4. Interpret the distribution of time intervals

The tool requires events to occur on at least two different days for Usage Interval Analysis and provides percentage breakdowns of users triggering events at specific frequencies.

## Interpretation and Application

The Retention Analysis chart provides:
- A visual heatmap showing retention percentages over time
- A breakdown table with detailed retention numbers
- Options to view data as absolute retention or change over time
- Ability to compare retention across different user segments
- Insights into natural usage patterns through the Usage Interval view

These insights help product teams understand engagement patterns, identify drop-off points, optimize product features, and set appropriate retention benchmarks based on their product's natural usage cycle.
