# Amplitude Retention Analysis

## Overview

Amplitude's Retention Analysis is a specialized analytics tool designed to help product teams understand user engagement patterns over time. It measures how frequently users return to a product after performing specific actions by tracking the relationship between starting events and return events. This analysis enables teams to identify usage patterns, measure engagement, and optimize product experiences to improve user retention.

Key features include:
- Multiple retention calculation methodologies
- Usage interval analysis for natural product usage patterns
- Flexible time calculation options
- User segmentation and property filtering
- Comprehensive visualization tools

## Product Relationships and Features

### Retention Analysis Chart Building
The core functionality allows users to configure:
- Starting events (the initial action users perform)
- Return events (the action users must perform to be considered "retained")
- User segments for targeted analysis
- Property filters to refine cohorts
- Various retention measurement methods

### Retention Calculation Methods
Three primary calculation approaches are available:
1. **Return On or After**: Tracks if users return at any point after a specified interval
2. **Return On**: Tracks if users return specifically during a specified interval
3. **Return On Custom**: Allows custom definition of return periods

### Usage Interval Analysis
This feature:
- Measures time between occurrences of critical events
- Shows percentage of active users at different frequencies (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Helps identify natural product usage patterns
- Calculates median frequency of user engagement

### Time Calculation Options
Users can choose between:
- Rolling 24-hour windows (default)
- Strict calendar dates
- Different calculation methods for daily, weekly, and monthly retention

### Visualization and Interpretation Tools
The platform provides:
- Retention charts for visual trend analysis
- Detailed breakdown tables
- Change-over-time views
- Retention brackets to categorize performance

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Starting Event**: The initial action that places users in a retention cohort
- **Return Event**: The action users must perform to be considered "retained"
- **Cohort Entry Date**: When users first performed the starting event
- **Usage Interval**: Time between occurrences of a critical event
- **Return On or After Retention**: Measures returns at any point after specified interval
- **Return On Retention**: Measures returns specifically during specified interval
- **Return On Custom Retention**: Allows custom return period definition
- **Retention Brackets**: Visual indicators showing retention performance ranges
- **Median Frequency**: Middle value in the distribution of time intervals between events
- **Inflection Point**: Point where retention patterns significantly change

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Retention Analysis is integrated within Amplitude's broader analytics platform. While specific integration details aren't fully documented, the tool:
- Connects with Amplitude's event tracking system
- Leverages the platform's user segmentation capabilities
- Utilizes property filtering functionality
- Complements other Amplitude analytics tools for comprehensive user behavior analysis

## Interface and Access

The tool is primarily accessed through Amplitude's web interface, which includes:
- Event selection modules
- Segmentation configuration
- Measurement method settings
- Visualization tools for interpreting results

Users can build retention charts by selecting events, configuring measurement parameters, applying segments and filters, and analyzing the resulting visualizations to derive insights about user retention patterns.
