## Ampli: Type-Safe Analytics SDK Generator and Validation Platform

Ampli is Amplitude's code generation and validation platform that creates strongly-typed analytics SDKs from tracking plan definitions. It bridges the gap between data governance and developer implementation by generating type-safe wrapper libraries that ensure analytics instrumentation matches predefined tracking plans in Amplitude Data.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Ampli ecosystem consists of three core components that work together to provide end-to-end analytics implementation governance:

**Ampli CLI** serves as the primary interface for developers, providing commands for initialization (`ampli init`), code generation (`ampli pull`), validation (`ampli status`), and source control management (`ampli checkout`). The CLI integrates with Amplitude Data workspaces to synchronize tracking plan definitions with local development environments.

**Ampli Wrapper** is the generated strongly-typed API layer that replaces manual JSON object creation with autocomplete-enabled method calls. Generated via `ampli pull`, these wrappers provide compile-time validation and runtime type safety for event tracking implementations.

**Source Control Integration** enables parallel management of tracking plan branches alongside Git branches, allowing teams to coordinate data schema changes with code changes through branch-based workflows and CI/CD validation.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Tracking Plan**: The centralized schema definition in Amplitude Data that specifies event names, properties, and validation rules for analytics implementation.

**Ampli Wrapper**: The generated, strongly-typed SDK that provides methods like `ampli.songPlayed()` or `ampli.track(new SongPlayed())` instead of manual JSON construction.

**Data Branch**: Tracking plan branches in Amplitude Data that parallel Git branches, enabling coordinated schema and code evolution.

**Implementation Status**: The validation state of analytics instrumentation against tracking plan definitions, verified through `ampli status` commands.

**ampli.json**: The local configuration file that defines workspace connections, source mappings, and generation settings for the Ampli CLI.

## Ecosystem Integration and Migration Strategy

Ampli supports progressive migration from existing Amplitude SDK implementations through a three-phase approach:

1. **SDK-only**: Traditional Amplitude SDK usage with manual event tracking
2. **Hybrid**: Combined implementation using `ampli.load({ client: { instance: amplitude }})` to leverage existing SDK instances while introducing type safety
3. **Ampli-only**: Full migration to generated wrapper methods with complete type safety and validation

The platform integrates with broader development workflows through CI/CD validation, supporting GitHub Actions and Bitbucket Pipelines via Docker containers (`amplitudeinc/ampli`, `amplitudeinc/ampli-all`) for automated tracking plan compliance verification.

## API Endpoints and Command Line Interface

**Core CLI Commands:**
- `ampli pull`: Generates type-safe SDK from tracking plan definitions
- `ampli status`: Validates implementation against tracking plan with linting capabilities
- `ampli status --is-merged/--is-latest`: Checks branch synchronization status
- `ampli checkout`: Switches between tracking plan branches
- `ampli configure`: Sets up workspace and authentication
- `ampli init`: Initializes new Ampli project configuration

**Installation Methods:**
- Homebrew: `brew install ampli`
- npm: `@amplitude/ampli` package
- Docker: `amplitudeinc/ampli` and `amplitudeinc/ampli-all` containers

**Authentication:**
- AMPLI_TOKEN environment variable for CI/CD integration
- API token creation through Amplitude Data workspace settings

The platform supports monorepo architectures and provides branch-based tracking plan management with enforcement capabilities for coordinating data schema changes with code deployments through automated CI pipeline integration.
