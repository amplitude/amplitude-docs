# Ampli: Type-Safe Analytics Instrumentation for Amplitude Data

## Product Overview

Ampli is a suite of tools designed to improve analytics implementation by providing type-safe, validated event tracking for applications. It consists of the Ampli CLI and Ampli Wrapper, which work together to ensure developers correctly instrument tracking code according to predefined tracking plans in Amplitude Data. The solution bridges the gap between tracking plan design and implementation, eliminating common issues like typos, missing properties, and inconsistent event tracking.

Key features include:
- Type-safe analytics SDK generation
- Instrumentation verification against tracking plans
- Source code linting for analytics calls
- CI/CD integration for validation
- Progressive migration path from standard Amplitude SDK
- Support for multiple programming languages and environments
- Branch-based workflow for coordinating tracking plan changes

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Ampli ecosystem consists of several interconnected components:

1. **Amplitude Data** - The central repository where tracking plans are defined, managed, and versioned.

2. **Ampli CLI** - Command-line tool that:
   - Pulls tracking plans from Amplitude Data (`ampli pull`)
   - Generates type-safe SDK wrappers
   - Verifies instrumentation against tracking plans (`ampli status`)
   - Supports branch-based workflows for team coordination

3. **Ampli Wrapper** - The generated type-safe library that:
   - Provides strongly-typed methods matching tracking plan definitions
   - Validates events at compile time and runtime
   - Wraps the underlying Amplitude SDK with improved developer experience

4. **Source Control Integration** - Coordinates tracking plan changes between Amplitude Data branches and code repository branches

5. **CI/CD Integration** - Validates analytics implementation in continuous integration workflows

The typical workflow involves defining a tracking plan in Amplitude Data, using the Ampli CLI to generate a type-safe wrapper, implementing analytics using the wrapper's strongly-typed methods, and validating the implementation through CI/CD.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Tracking Plan**: A specification in Amplitude Data that defines events, their properties, and validation rules
- **ampli.json**: Configuration file that stores Ampli settings and tracking plan metadata
- **ampli pull**: CLI command to fetch the latest tracking plan and generate type-safe code
- **ampli status**: CLI command to verify if implementation matches the tracking plan
- **Ampli Wrapper**: The generated type-safe library that provides strongly-typed methods for tracking events
- **ampli.load()**: Method to initialize the Ampli wrapper with configuration options
- **ampli.track()**: Method to send events through the Ampli wrapper
- **ampli.client**: Access to the underlying Amplitude SDK instance
- **is-merged flag**: Indicates if a tracking plan branch has been merged in Amplitude Data
- **is-latest flag**: Indicates if the local implementation is using the latest tracking plan version

## Integration with Broader Ecosystem

Ampli fits into the broader Amplitude ecosystem as follows:

1. **Amplitude Data**: Serves as the source of truth for tracking plans that Ampli implements
2. **Amplitude Analytics**: The underlying platform where events are ultimately sent and analyzed
3. **Development Workflow**: Integrates with existing development processes through:
   - Source control systems (Git)
   - CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, Bitbucket Pipelines)
   - IDE tooling (through type safety and autocomplete)
4. **Team Collaboration**: Enables coordination between:
   - Product managers defining tracking requirements
   - Data analysts specifying event schemas
   - Developers implementing tracking code

## Key Commands and API Endpoints

### Ampli CLI Commands

- `ampli pull [--path] [--branch]`: Pull tracking plan and generate SDK
