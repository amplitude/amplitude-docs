## Amplitude Analytics Flutter SDK

The Amplitude Analytics Flutter SDK is a comprehensive analytics solution that enables Flutter applications to track user events, behaviors, and revenue data through Amplitude's analytics platform. The SDK provides cross-platform support for iOS, macOS, Android, and web applications, offering seamless integration with Flutter's development ecosystem.

## Product Versions and Evolution

The documentation covers two major versions of the Flutter SDK with distinct architectural approaches:

**Flutter SDK v3 (Maintenance Mode)**: A cross-platform wrapper around native Android, iOS, and JavaScript SDKs that provides Dart-specific configuration options. This version serves as a bridge between Flutter applications and platform-specific Amplitude implementations.

**Flutter SDK v4 (Current)**: A modernized implementation utilizing Amplitude's HTTP V2 API directly, offering improved performance, simplified architecture, and enhanced feature parity across platforms. This version represents a significant architectural shift from wrapper-based to direct API integration.

## Core Features and Capabilities

### Event Tracking System
The SDK provides comprehensive event tracking capabilities through a unified API that captures user interactions, application lifecycle events, and custom business events. The system supports both basic event logging and advanced event properties for detailed behavioral analysis.

### User Identification and Properties Management
Advanced user management features include user identification, property setting, and dynamic user attribute updates. The SDK supports both anonymous and identified user tracking with seamless transitions between states.

### Revenue and Conversion Tracking
Built-in revenue tracking capabilities enable e-commerce and subscription-based applications to monitor financial metrics, including transaction values, product purchases, and revenue attribution.

### Session and Lifecycle Management
Automatic session tracking captures user engagement patterns, application lifecycle events, and session duration metrics without requiring manual implementation.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**BaseEvent**: The fundamental event object structure used in SDK v4 for all tracking operations, replacing the previous logEvent methodology.

**Configuration Object**: An immutable configuration system in v4 that replaces individual setter methods, providing centralized and type-safe configuration management.

**DefaultTrackingOptions**: Automated tracking configuration that enables session tracking, app lifecycle events, and deep link tracking without manual setup.

**ServerZone**: Geographic data residency configuration supporting EU and US data centers for compliance with regional data protection requirements.

**minIdLength**: HTTP V2 API requirement specifying minimum character length for user and device identifiers to ensure data quality and consistency.

**flushQueueSize/flushIntervalMillis**: Batch processing configuration parameters controlling when events are transmitted to Amplitude servers for optimal performance and reliability.

## API Methods and Integration Points

### Core Tracking Methods
- `amplitude.track()`: Primary event tracking method (v4) replacing `logEvent()` from v3
- `amplitude.identify()`: User property management and identification
- `amplitude.revenue()`: Revenue event tracking replacing `logRevenue()` from v3
- `amplitude.flush()`: Manual event transmission replacing `uploadEvents()` from v3
- `amplitude.reset()`: User session and data reset functionality

### Configuration and Setup
- `amplitude_flutter` package installation via pubspec.yaml
- Platform-specific configuration for iOS (CocoaPods), Android (Kotlin/Gradle), and web (Browser SDK 2)
- ServerZone configuration for EU data residency compliance
- DefaultTrackingOptions for automated event collection

### User and Group Management
- `setUserId()`: User identification assignment
- `setDeviceId()`: Device identifier management
- `setGroup()`: User group assignment for cohort analysis
- `groupIdentify()`: Group property management

## Platform Requirements and Dependencies

### Version 4 Requirements
- iOS 13.0+ minimum platform support
- Kotlin 1.9.22+ for Android development
- Gradle 8.2+ build system compatibility
- Browser SDK 2 snippet for web applications
- HTTP V2 API integration for all platforms

### Version 3 Legacy Support
- Cross-platform wrapper architecture
- Native SDK dependencies (amplitude-8.12.0-min.gz.js for web)
- dart:js_interop for Flutter web integration
- Backward compatibility with existing implementations

## Migration and Upgrade Path

The documentation provides comprehensive migration guidance from SDK v3 to v4, addressing breaking changes including API method renaming, configuration object restructuring, dependency updates, and platform requirement changes. Key migration considerations include updating method calls, reconfiguring initialization parameters, and ensuring platform compatibility with updated minimum requirements.

The migration path emphasizes the architectural benefits of moving from wrapper-based to direct HTTP V2 API integration, resulting in improved performance, reduced dependency complexity, and enhanced cross-platform consistency.
