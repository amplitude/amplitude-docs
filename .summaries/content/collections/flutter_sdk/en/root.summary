## Amplitude Analytics Flutter SDK

The Amplitude Analytics Flutter SDK is a comprehensive analytics solution that enables Flutter applications to track user events, behaviors, and revenue data to the Amplitude platform. The SDK has evolved through multiple major versions, with version 4 representing the current generation and version 3 in maintenance mode.

## Product Versions and Evolution

### Flutter SDK 4.0 (Current)
The latest version leverages Amplitude's HTTP V2 API and provides native Flutter integration with enhanced performance and modern architecture. It requires Kotlin 1.9.22 and Gradle 8.2, supporting iOS 13.0+ and modern web browsers through Browser SDK 2 integration.

### Flutter SDK 3.0 (Maintenance Mode)
The legacy version functions as a wrapper around platform-specific SDKs (Android, iOS, JavaScript) and remains available for existing implementations but receives only maintenance updates.

## Core Features and Capabilities

### Event Tracking
- **BaseEvent System**: Comprehensive event tracking using structured event objects
- **Custom Events**: Track user actions with custom properties and metadata
- **Revenue Tracking**: Dedicated revenue event tracking with product details and pricing
- **Default Tracking**: Automatic session tracking, app lifecycle events, and deep link monitoring

### User Management
- **User Identification**: Set and manage user IDs with `setUserId()` and device IDs with `setDeviceId()`
- **User Properties**: Manage user attributes through `identify()` operations
- **Group Analytics**: Support for group-based analytics via `groupIdentify()`
- **User Privacy**: COPPA compliance controls and user data management

### Configuration and Performance
- **Flush Controls**: Configurable batching with `flushQueueSize` and `flushIntervalMillis`
- **Server Zones**: Support for EU data residency through `ServerZone.eu`
- **Minimum ID Length**: Configurable `minIdLength` validation
- **Session Management**: Automatic session tracking with out-of-session support (`sessionId: -1`)

## Key API Methods and Integration

### Primary Tracking Methods
- `amplitude.track()` - Event tracking (replaces `logEvent()` in v4)
- `amplitude.identify()` - User property management
- `amplitude.revenue()` - Revenue event tracking
- `amplitude.flush()` - Manual event upload (replaces `uploadEvents()` in v4)
- `amplitude.reset()` - Clear user data and reset state

### Configuration Objects
Version 4 introduces structured Configuration object initialization, replacing the deprecated `instance()` method pattern from version 3.

### Platform-Specific Integration
- **iOS/macOS**: CocoaPods integration with platform requirements in Podfile
- **Android**: Gradle configuration with Kotlin compatibility
- **Web**: Browser SDK 2 snippet integration for Flutter web applications

## Migration and Compatibility

The SDK provides comprehensive migration paths between versions, with detailed breaking change documentation covering:
- API method renames and signature changes
- Configuration object restructuring
- Dependency requirement updates
- Platform-specific compatibility requirements

## Ecosystem Integration

The Flutter SDK integrates seamlessly with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem, supporting cross-platform data consistency and leveraging Amplitude's backend infrastructure for data processing, real-time analytics, and user behavior insights. The SDK maintains compatibility with Amplitude's web dashboard, cohort analysis tools, and integration capabilities with other marketing and analytics platforms.

The documentation structure supports both current implementation (SDK 4) and legacy maintenance (SDK 3), ensuring comprehensive coverage for all deployment scenarios while encouraging migration to the modern architecture.
