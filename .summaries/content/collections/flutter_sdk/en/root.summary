## Amplitude Analytics Flutter SDK

The Amplitude Analytics Flutter SDK is a comprehensive analytics solution that enables Flutter applications to track user events, behaviors, and revenue data. The SDK has evolved through multiple versions, with version 4 representing a significant architectural shift from a native wrapper approach to a unified HTTP V2 API implementation.

## Product Versions and Evolution

**Flutter SDK 3 (Maintenance Mode)**: A wrapper-based architecture around native Android, iOS, and JavaScript SDKs that provides cross-platform analytics capabilities through Dart language integration. This version maintains compatibility with existing Flutter web applications and legacy implementations.

**Flutter SDK 4 (Current)**: A modernized implementation using Amplitude's HTTP V2 API directly, eliminating the wrapper architecture for improved performance and consistency. This version requires updated platform requirements including Kotlin 1.9.22, Gradle 8.2, and iOS 13.0+.

## Core Features and Capabilities

The SDK provides comprehensive event tracking through `BaseEvent` objects, user identification via `setUserId()` and `setDeviceId()`, revenue tracking with dedicated Revenue API, and user property management through `Identify` operations. Default tracking capabilities include automatic session management, app lifecycle events, and deep link tracking through `DefaultTrackingOptions`.

Advanced features encompass user grouping with `groupIdentify()`, batch event processing via `useBatch`, configurable data residency through `ServerZone.eu`, and COPPA compliance controls. The SDK supports dynamic configuration, advertising ID collection, and comprehensive opt-out tracking mechanisms.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**BaseEvent**: Core event object containing event data and metadata for tracking user interactions
**Identify**: Operation class for managing user properties and attributes
**Revenue**: Specialized tracking object for monetary transactions and revenue attribution
**DefaultTrackingOptions**: Configuration object controlling automatic event collection (sessions, app lifecycles, deep links)
**ServerZone**: Geographic data residency configuration (US/EU)
**deviceId/userId**: Primary user identification mechanisms with validation requirements
**flushQueueSize/flushIntervalMillis**: Batch processing configuration parameters
**minIdLength**: Validation parameter for user and device identifiers

## API Methods and Configuration

Core tracking methods include `track()` for event logging (migrated from `logEvent()`), `flush()` for immediate event upload (migrated from `uploadEvents()`), and `revenue()` for monetary tracking. Configuration involves `Configuration` object initialization replacing direct `instance()` calls, with parameters for batch processing, server zones, and tracking options.

Platform-specific setup requires CocoaPods installation for iOS/macOS and Browser SDK 2 snippet integration for Flutter Web. The SDK integrates through `pubspec.yaml` dependency management and supports both pub.dev distribution and local development workflows.

## Migration and Compatibility

The migration from SDK 3 to 4 involves significant breaking changes including API method renames, configuration object restructuring, and platform requirement updates. Key migration points include replacing `instance()` patterns with `Configuration` objects, updating method calls (`logEvent()` → `track()`, `uploadEvents()` → `flush()`), and implementing Browser SDK 2 snippets for web applications.

Session management changes include `sessionId -1` for out-of-session events, while removed functionality includes `clearUserProperties()`, `setUserProperties()`, `logRevenue()`, and `regenerateDeviceId()` methods that require alternative implementation approaches.

## Ecosystem Integration

The Flutter SDK integrates within Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem, supporting HTTP V2 API endpoints for unified data collection and processing. Cross-platform compatibility ensures consistent tracking across Android, iOS, and web platforms while maintaining data consistency through centralized API architecture.

The SDK supports enterprise features including EU data residency compliance, batch processing optimization, and comprehensive user privacy controls, positioning it as a scalable solution for applications requiring robust analytics capabilities across diverse deployment environments.
