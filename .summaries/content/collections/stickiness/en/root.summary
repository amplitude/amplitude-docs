# Amplitude Stickiness Feature

## Overview

Amplitude's Stickiness feature is an analytics tool designed to help product teams measure and understand user engagement patterns by analyzing how frequently users perform specific events over time. The primary purpose of this feature is to identify which product features or behaviors drive consistent engagement, helping teams differentiate between power users and regular users, and ultimately improve user retention.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Stickiness Chart
A visualization tool that displays the frequency of user interactions with specific features or events over a defined time period. The chart helps identify:
- Which features keep users coming back
- How many days users perform specific actions within a time frame
- Differences in behavior patterns between user segments

### Analysis Methods
1. **Cumulative Stickiness**: Measures users who performed an event at least N days during the time period
2. **Non-Cumulative Stickiness**: Shows the exact distribution of users who performed an event exactly N days during the time period

### Data Visualization
- The Stickiness chart displays days of activity on the x-axis and percentage of users on the y-axis
- Data can be viewed in chart or table format
- Supports tracking changes over time to identify trends in user engagement

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Stickiness**: A metric that measures how frequently users perform specific events over a given time period
- **Power Users**: Users who engage with the product more frequently than average users
- **Retention Drivers**: Features or behaviors that encourage users to return to the product
- **Segmentation Module**: Tool used to filter and compare different user segments
- **Event Properties**: Specific attributes of events that can be used for more granular analysis
- **Microscope Feature**: Tool that allows deeper investigation into specific data points

## Product Integration in Amplitude Ecosystem

The Stickiness feature integrates with other Amplitude analytics tools to provide a comprehensive view of user behavior:

1. **Segmentation Module**: Used to filter Stickiness charts by user segments for comparative analysis
2. **Metrics Module**: Provides the framework for measuring and visualizing stickiness metrics
3. **Behavioral Cohorts**: Stickiness analysis can be used to create cohorts of users based on their engagement patterns

## Usage

### Creating a Stickiness Chart
1. Navigate to the Stickiness chart in Amplitude
2. Select the events to analyze
3. Choose a time period (day, week, month)
4. Apply segmentation as needed to compare different user groups
5. Select between cumulative and non-cumulative analysis methods

### Interpreting Results
- Higher stickiness indicates more frequent engagement with the analyzed feature
- Compare stickiness patterns between different user segments to identify behaviors of power users
- Track changes in stickiness over time to measure the impact of product changes

### Advanced Analysis
- Use the data table to see exact numbers and percentages
- Create cohorts from stickiness analysis for further investigation
- Apply the Microscope feature to drill down into specific data points

The Stickiness feature is particularly valuable for product teams looking to identify which features drive consistent engagement and should be prioritized for development or promotion to increase overall user retention.
