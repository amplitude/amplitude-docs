# Amplitude Stickiness Feature

## Overview

Amplitude's Stickiness feature is an analytics tool designed to help product teams measure and analyze user engagement patterns over time. The Stickiness chart specifically helps identify which features drive user engagement by visualizing how frequently users perform specific events within a given time period. This tool is particularly valuable for distinguishing behaviors between power users and regular users, identifying retention drivers, and creating targeted user segments based on engagement patterns.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Stickiness Chart
- **Purpose**: Measures how frequently users perform specific events over time
- **Analysis Types**:
  - **Cumulative Stickiness**: Tracks users who performed an event at least X days in a time period
  - **Non-cumulative Stickiness**: Tracks users who performed an event exactly X days in a time period
- **Time Frames**: Supports daily, weekly, and monthly frequency analysis
- **Visualization**: Displays engagement patterns as a chart with accompanying data table

### Engagement Analysis Capabilities
- **Power User Identification**: Helps identify highly engaged users and their behaviors
- **Feature Impact Assessment**: Determines which features drive the most consistent engagement
- **Segmentation**: Allows breaking down analysis by user segments and properties
- **Trend Analysis**: Tracks changes in engagement patterns over time
- **Behavioral Cohort Creation**: Enables creating user cohorts based on engagement frequency

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Stickiness**: A metric measuring how frequently users perform specific events over a time period
- **Cumulative Stickiness**: Users who performed an event at least X days in a time period
- **Non-cumulative Stickiness**: Users who performed an event exactly X days in a time period
- **Segmentation Module**: Component allowing analysis breakdown by user properties
- **Metrics Module**: Component for configuring measurement parameters
- **Microscope Feature**: Tool for deeper analysis of specific data points
- **Behavioral Cohorts**: User groups defined by specific engagement patterns
- **Event Properties**: Attributes associated with tracked events that can be used for filtering
- **User Segments**: Groups of users sharing common characteristics or behaviors

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Stickiness feature appears to be part of Amplitude's broader analytics platform, working alongside other analysis tools:

1. **Relationship to Retention Analysis**: While retention focuses on return rates, stickiness measures engagement frequency
2. **Segmentation Integration**: Leverages Amplitude's segmentation capabilities for detailed breakdowns
3. **Cohort Creation**: Findings from stickiness analysis can be used to create behavioral cohorts for further analysis or targeting
4. **Data Visualization**: Part of Amplitude's visualization suite for understanding user behavior

## Usage

The Stickiness feature is accessed through Amplitude's interface, where users can:

1. Create a new Stickiness chart
2. Select events to analyze
3. Configure measurement parameters (cumulative vs. non-cumulative)
4. Apply segmentation for comparative analysis
5. Adjust time frames for analysis
6. Export or save findings
7. Create behavioral cohorts based on engagement patterns

The documentation does not specify exact API endpoints or command line invocations for the Stickiness feature, suggesting it is primarily accessed through Amplitude's web interface.
