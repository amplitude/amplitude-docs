# Amplitude Stickiness Feature

## Overview

Amplitude's Stickiness feature is an analytics tool designed to help product teams measure and understand user engagement patterns by analyzing how frequently users perform specific events over time. The primary purpose of Stickiness analysis is to identify which features drive engagement, differentiate behaviors between power users and regular users, and track how user habits form and change over time.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Stickiness Charts
- **Purpose**: Visualize how frequently users perform specific events over a selected time period
- **Analysis Types**:
  - **Cumulative Stickiness**: Shows the percentage of users who performed an event at least X days during the time period
  - **Non-cumulative Stickiness**: Shows the exact distribution of users who performed an event exactly X days

### Analysis Capabilities
- Identify features that drive retention and engagement
- Compare usage patterns between different user segments
- Track changes in user engagement over time
- Create behavioral cohorts based on usage frequency
- Analyze day-based usage patterns to understand user habits

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Stickiness**: A metric measuring how frequently users perform specific events over a time period
- **Cumulative Stickiness**: Analysis showing users who performed an event at least X days
- **Non-cumulative Stickiness**: Analysis showing users who performed an event exactly X days
- **Segmentation Module**: Component used to define user segments for stickiness analysis
- **Metrics Module**: Component used to track changes in stickiness metrics over time
- **Microscope Feature**: Tool to create cohorts from stickiness analysis results
- **Power Users**: Users who engage with the product more frequently than average users
- **Behavioral Cohorts**: User groups defined by specific usage patterns or frequencies

## Product Integration in Amplitude Ecosystem

Stickiness analysis integrates with other Amplitude features to provide a comprehensive view of user engagement:

1. **Segmentation Module**: Used to define and compare different user segments within stickiness charts
2. **Metrics Module**: Allows tracking of stickiness metrics over time to identify trends
3. **Microscope Feature**: Enables creation of cohorts from stickiness analysis for further investigation
4. **Retention Analysis**: Complements stickiness by providing another perspective on user engagement
5. **Behavioral Cohorts**: Can be created from stickiness analysis and used across the Amplitude platform

## Usage Instructions

### Creating a Stickiness Chart
1. Navigate to the Stickiness chart in Amplitude
2. Select the events to analyze
3. Define the time period for analysis
4. Choose between cumulative and non-cumulative analysis
5. Apply user segments if needed
6. Analyze the resulting visualization and data table

### Interpreting Stickiness Results
- Use the data table to see exact percentages of users performing events on specific numbers of days
- Compare stickiness between different user segments to identify engagement patterns
- Track changes in stickiness over time to measure the impact of product changes
- Create cohorts from stickiness analysis using the Microscope feature for further investigation

### Advanced Analysis Options
- Segment users by properties to compare engagement across different user groups
- Analyze weekly or monthly frequency patterns for subscription-based products
- Track changes in stickiness metrics over time to measure the impact of product changes
- Create behavioral cohorts based on usage frequency for targeted marketing or product development

The Stickiness feature is particularly valuable for product teams seeking to understand which features drive engagement, how user habits form over time, and how to identify and nurture power users who demonstrate high engagement with the product.
