# Amplitude Stickiness Analysis

## Overview

Amplitude's Stickiness feature is an analytics tool designed to help product teams measure and understand user engagement patterns by analyzing how frequently users perform specific events over time. The primary purpose of Stickiness analysis is to identify which features drive engagement, differentiate behaviors between power users and regular users, and discover retention drivers within a product.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Stickiness Charts

Stickiness charts visualize how frequently users perform specific events over a selected time period. These charts help product teams:

- Identify which features are most engaging to users
- Understand usage patterns and habits
- Differentiate behaviors between power users and casual users
- Discover which features drive retention

### Analysis Methods

Stickiness offers two primary analysis methods:

1. **Cumulative Stickiness**: Shows the percentage of users who performed an event at least N days during the time period. This method is useful for understanding overall engagement levels.

2. **Non-Cumulative Stickiness**: Shows the exact percentage of users who performed an event on exactly N days during the time period. This provides more granular insights into usage patterns.

### Metrics Module

The Stickiness feature is part of Amplitude's Metrics Module, which allows users to track changes in stickiness metrics over time and compare different time periods to identify trends in user engagement.

### Segmentation Capabilities

Stickiness analysis can be combined with Amplitude's segmentation features to:
- Compare stickiness metrics across different user segments
- Filter analysis by event properties
- Create and analyze custom user cohorts based on engagement patterns

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Stickiness**: A measure of how frequently users perform specific events over a defined time period.
- **Cumulative Stickiness**: Analysis showing users who performed an event at least N days.
- **Non-Cumulative Stickiness**: Analysis showing users who performed an event exactly N days.
- **Microscope Feature**: A tool that allows users to inspect specific data points in the Stickiness chart.
- **Behavioral Cohorts**: User groups created based on specific engagement patterns identified in Stickiness analysis.
- **Event Properties**: Attributes associated with events that can be used to filter Stickiness analysis.
- **Power Users**: Highly engaged users who perform key events more frequently than average users.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Stickiness analysis integrates with other Amplitude features to provide a comprehensive understanding of user behavior:

1. **Segmentation Module**: Allows filtering of Stickiness analysis by user properties and behaviors.
2. **Cohort Creation**: Enables creation of user segments based on Stickiness patterns for further analysis.
3. **Metrics Module**: Provides the ability to track changes in Stickiness metrics over time.
4. **Data Table Breakdowns**: Offers detailed numerical data to complement visual charts.

## Usage Instructions

### Creating a Stickiness Chart

1. Navigate to the Stickiness chart in Amplitude
2. Select the events to analyze
3. Choose a time period for analysis
4. Apply any desired segmentation or filters based on event properties
5. Select either cumulative or non-cumulative analysis method

### Interpreting Results

1. Examine the distribution of users across different frequency levels
2. Compare stickiness patterns between different user segments
3. Track changes in stickiness metrics over time
4. Use the Microscope feature to inspect specific data points
5. Create behavioral cohorts based on engagement patterns for further analysis

### Advanced Analysis

- Compare weekly vs. monthly frequency patterns
- Analyze how stickiness metrics change over time
- Create and save cohorts of users based on their engagement frequency
- Use segmentation to identify differences in stickiness between user groups

The Stickiness feature appears to be a core analytics capability within Amplitude's product suite, designed to help product teams understand and improve user engagement through data-driven insights.
