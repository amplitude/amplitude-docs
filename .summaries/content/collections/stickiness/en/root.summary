## Amplitude Stickiness

Amplitude Stickiness is a product analytics feature that measures user engagement frequency by analyzing how often users perform specific events within defined time periods. This tool helps product teams identify power users, understand engagement patterns, and measure user retention through behavioral frequency analysis.

## Product Relationships and Features

The Stickiness feature integrates with several core Amplitude components:

- **Event System**: Leverages Amplitude's event instrumentation to track user actions and behaviors
- **Segmentation Module**: Imports saved user segments and creates new behavioral cohorts based on stickiness results
- **User Properties**: Groups and filters users by demographic or behavioral attributes
- **Microscope Integration**: Provides detailed drill-down capabilities for deeper user behavior analysis
- **Metrics Module**: Offers measurement modes and analytical frameworks for interpreting engagement data

The feature supports both chart creation and interpretation workflows, allowing users to build stickiness analyses and extract actionable insights from the results.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Stickiness Chart**: A visualization showing user engagement frequency over time, displaying how many days users performed specific events within weekly or monthly periods

**Non-cumulative vs Cumulative Measurement**: 
- Non-cumulative: Shows exact frequency (e.g., users who performed an event exactly 3 days)
- Cumulative: Shows minimum frequency (e.g., users who performed an event 3+ days)

**X-axis Day Buckets**: Time period divisions (weekly/monthly) that segment the analysis timeframe

**Any Event Selection**: Option to analyze stickiness across all user events rather than specific actions

**Behavioral Cohorts**: User groups created based on stickiness patterns and engagement frequency

**Power User Analysis**: Identification of highly engaged users through frequent event performance

**Change Over Time View**: Temporal analysis showing how stickiness patterns evolve across different time periods

**Breakdown Data Table**: Detailed tabular view of stickiness results with user percentage calculations

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Stickiness functions as a specialized retention and engagement analysis tool within Amplitude's broader product analytics platform. It connects to:

- **Event Tracking Infrastructure**: Relies on properly instrumented events to measure user behavior frequency
- **User Segmentation System**: Both consumes existing segments and produces new behavioral cohorts
- **Retention Analytics**: Complements other retention measurement tools by focusing on engagement frequency rather than simple return visits
- **Product Analytics Suite**: Integrates with other Amplitude charts and analysis tools for comprehensive user behavior understanding

The feature supports the complete analytics workflow from data collection through insight generation, enabling product teams to identify engagement patterns, create targeted user segments, and optimize for increased user stickiness and retention.
