# Amplitude Stickiness Feature

## Overview

Amplitude's Stickiness feature is an analytics tool that measures user engagement patterns by analyzing how frequently users perform specific events over time. This tool helps product teams identify which features drive consistent engagement, differentiate between power users and regular users, and ultimately improve user retention. By understanding which product elements keep users coming back, teams can make data-driven decisions to enhance user experience and increase product adoption.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Stickiness Chart
A visualization tool that displays the frequency of user interactions with specific features or events over a defined time period. The chart reveals:
- Which features keep users coming back
- How many days users perform specific actions within a time frame
- Differences in behavior patterns between user segments

### Analysis Methods
1. **Cumulative Stickiness**: Measures users who performed an event at least N days during the time period
2. **Non-Cumulative Stickiness**: Shows the exact distribution of users who performed an event exactly N days during the time period

### Data Visualization
- X-axis displays days of activity
- Y-axis shows percentage of users
- Data viewable in chart or table format
- Supports tracking changes over time to identify trends in user engagement

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Stickiness**: A metric measuring how frequently users perform specific events over a given time period
- **Power Users**: Users who engage with the product more frequently than average users
- **Retention Drivers**: Features or behaviors that encourage users to return to the product
- **Segmentation Module**: Tool used to filter and compare different user segments
- **Event Properties**: Specific attributes of events used for more granular analysis
- **Microscope Feature**: Tool allowing deeper investigation into specific data points

## Product Integration in Amplitude Ecosystem

Stickiness integrates with other Amplitude analytics tools to provide a comprehensive view of user behavior:

1. **Segmentation Module**: Filters Stickiness charts by user segments for comparative analysis
2. **Metrics Module**: Provides the framework for measuring and visualizing stickiness metrics
3. **Behavioral Cohorts**: Stickiness analysis can create cohorts of users based on engagement patterns

## Usage

### Creating a Stickiness Chart
1. Navigate to the Stickiness chart in Amplitude
2. Select events to analyze
3. Choose a time period (day, week, month)
4. Apply segmentation to compare different user groups
5. Select between cumulative and non-cumulative analysis methods

### Interpreting Results
- Higher stickiness indicates more frequent engagement with the analyzed feature
- Compare stickiness patterns between different user segments to identify behaviors of power users
- Track changes in stickiness over time to measure the impact of product changes

### Advanced Analysis
- Use the data table for exact numbers and percentages
- Create cohorts from stickiness analysis for further investigation
- Apply the Microscope feature to drill down into specific data points

The Stickiness feature is particularly valuable for product teams looking to identify which features drive consistent engagement and should be prioritized for development or promotion to increase overall user retention.
