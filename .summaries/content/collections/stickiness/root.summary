# Amplitude Stickiness Feature

## Overview

Amplitude's Stickiness feature is an analytics tool that measures and visualizes how frequently users perform specific events within a defined time period. It helps product teams understand user engagement patterns over time, distinguish between power users and regular users, identify retention drivers, and create targeted user segments based on engagement frequency. The Stickiness chart provides insights into which features drive consistent user engagement and how engagement patterns evolve.

## Key Features and Capabilities

- **Engagement Frequency Analysis**: Visualizes how many days users perform specific events within a time period
- **Cumulative vs. Non-cumulative Analysis**:
  - Cumulative: Shows users who performed an event at least X days
  - Non-cumulative: Shows users who performed an event exactly X days
- **Flexible Time Frames**: Supports daily, weekly, and monthly frequency analysis
- **Power User Identification**: Helps identify and understand highly engaged users
- **Feature Impact Assessment**: Determines which product features drive consistent engagement
- **Segmentation**: Breaks down analysis by user segments and properties
- **Trend Analysis**: Tracks changes in engagement patterns over time
- **Behavioral Cohort Creation**: Enables creating user groups based on engagement frequency

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Stickiness**: Metric measuring how frequently users perform specific events over a time period
- **Cumulative Stickiness**: Users who performed an event at least X days in a time period
- **Non-cumulative Stickiness**: Users who performed an event exactly X days in a time period
- **Segmentation Module**: Component for breaking down analysis by user properties
- **Metrics Module**: Component for configuring measurement parameters
- **Microscope Feature**: Tool for deeper analysis of specific data points
- **Behavioral Cohorts**: User groups defined by specific engagement patterns
- **Event Properties**: Attributes associated with tracked events used for filtering
- **User Segments**: Groups of users sharing common characteristics or behaviors

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Stickiness is integrated within Amplitude's broader analytics platform:

1. **Complementary to Retention Analysis**: While retention focuses on return rates, stickiness measures engagement frequency
2. **Leverages Segmentation**: Uses Amplitude's segmentation capabilities for detailed breakdowns
3. **Feeds into Cohort Creation**: Findings can be used to create behavioral cohorts for further analysis or targeting
4. **Part of Visualization Suite**: Integrates with Amplitude's data visualization tools for understanding user behavior

## Usage Workflow

The Stickiness feature is accessed through Amplitude's web interface:

1. Create a new Stickiness chart
2. Select events to analyze
3. Configure measurement parameters (cumulative vs. non-cumulative)
4. Apply segmentation for comparative analysis
5. Adjust time frames for analysis
6. Export or save findings
7. Create behavioral cohorts based on engagement patterns

The Stickiness feature provides product teams with critical insights into engagement patterns, helping them identify which features keep users coming back and how to optimize for increased user engagement.
