# Amplitude Stickiness Feature

## Overview

Amplitude's Stickiness feature is an analytics tool that measures user engagement patterns by analyzing how frequently users perform specific events over time. This feature helps product teams identify which features drive engagement, differentiate behaviors between power users and regular users, and track how user habits form and change over time.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Stickiness Charts
- **Cumulative Stickiness**: Visualizes the percentage of users who performed an event at least X days during a selected time period
- **Non-cumulative Stickiness**: Shows the exact distribution of users who performed an event exactly X days

### Analysis Capabilities
- Identify features driving retention and engagement
- Compare usage patterns between different user segments
- Track changes in user engagement over time
- Create behavioral cohorts based on usage frequency
- Analyze day-based usage patterns to understand user habits

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Stickiness**: Metric measuring how frequently users perform specific events over a time period
- **Cumulative Stickiness**: Analysis showing users who performed an event at least X days
- **Non-cumulative Stickiness**: Analysis showing users who performed an event exactly X days
- **Segmentation Module**: Component for defining user segments in stickiness analysis
- **Metrics Module**: Component for tracking changes in stickiness metrics over time
- **Microscope Feature**: Tool for creating cohorts from stickiness analysis results
- **Power Users**: Users who engage with the product more frequently than average
- **Behavioral Cohorts**: User groups defined by specific usage patterns or frequencies

## Integration in Amplitude Ecosystem

Stickiness analysis integrates with other Amplitude features:

1. **Segmentation Module**: Defines and compares different user segments within stickiness charts
2. **Metrics Module**: Tracks stickiness metrics over time to identify trends
3. **Microscope Feature**: Creates cohorts from stickiness analysis for further investigation
4. **Retention Analysis**: Complements stickiness by providing another perspective on user engagement
5. **Behavioral Cohorts**: Can be created from stickiness analysis and used across the Amplitude platform

## Usage Instructions
