## Amplitude Stickiness

Amplitude Stickiness is a product analytics feature that measures user engagement frequency by analyzing how often users perform specific events within defined time periods. This tool helps product teams identify power users, understand engagement patterns, and measure user retention through behavioral frequency analysis.

## Product Relationships and Features

The Stickiness feature integrates with several core Amplitude components:

- **Event System**: Leverages Amplitude's event instrumentation to track user actions and behaviors
- **User Segmentation Module**: Enables filtering and grouping users based on properties and saved segments
- **Metrics Module**: Provides the interface for configuring measurement modes and analyzing results
- **Microscope Integration**: Allows drill-down analysis of specific user behaviors
- **Behavioral Cohorts**: Enables creation of user groups based on stickiness patterns for further analysis

The feature supports both weekly and monthly time frame analysis, with options for non-cumulative and cumulative measurement modes to provide different perspectives on user engagement habits.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Stickiness Chart**: A visualization showing how frequently users perform specific events over time periods, typically displayed as frequency buckets on the x-axis

**Non-cumulative Stickiness**: Measures exact frequency of event occurrence (e.g., users who performed an event exactly 3 times)

**Cumulative Stickiness**: Measures minimum frequency thresholds (e.g., users who performed an event at least 3 times)

**Event Properties**: Filters applied to events to analyze specific variations or conditions of user actions

**Any Event**: A selection option that allows analysis across all tracked events rather than specific event types

**Power User Analysis**: Identification of highly engaged users based on high-frequency event performance

**X-axis Day Buckets**: Time-based groupings that show frequency distribution across different engagement levels

**Breakdown Data Table**: Detailed tabular view of stickiness results showing specific metrics and user counts

**Change Over Time View**: Temporal analysis showing how stickiness patterns evolve across different time periods

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Stickiness operates as part of Amplitude's broader product analytics suite, connecting user behavior measurement with retention analysis and cohort creation. The feature serves as a bridge between raw event data and actionable user insights, enabling product teams to:

- Identify engagement patterns that correlate with long-term retention
- Create targeted user segments based on usage frequency
- Measure the effectiveness of product changes on user engagement habits
- Develop data-driven strategies for increasing user stickiness and product adoption

The integration with saved segments and user property grouping allows for sophisticated analysis across different user demographics and behavioral characteristics, while the behavioral cohort creation capability enables teams to act on stickiness insights through targeted campaigns and product optimizations.

## Technical Implementation

The Stickiness feature utilizes Amplitude's existing event instrumentation infrastructure, requiring no additional API endpoints or command line invocations beyond standard Amplitude event tracking. Analysis is conducted through the web interface using the Metrics Module, with results exportable through standard Amplitude data export mechanisms and integration points with the broader analytics platform.
