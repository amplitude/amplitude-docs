# Amplitude Stickiness Analysis

## Product Overview

Amplitude Stickiness is an advanced analytics tool designed to measure and visualize user engagement patterns over time. It helps product teams understand how frequently users perform specific events within a defined time period, enabling them to identify which features drive engagement, differentiate between power users and casual users, and discover retention drivers. Stickiness analysis is particularly valuable for understanding habit formation and feature adoption within digital products.

## Key Features and Capabilities

- **Stickiness Visualization**: Charts that display the frequency of user interactions with specific features
- **Dual Analysis Methods**: Both cumulative and non-cumulative stickiness measurement options
- **Segmentation Integration**: Ability to filter and compare stickiness metrics across different user segments
- **Microscope Feature**: Tool for inspecting specific data points within stickiness charts
- **Behavioral Cohort Creation**: Functionality to create user groups based on engagement patterns
- **Time Period Comparison**: Capability to analyze changes in stickiness metrics over different time periods

## Product Relationships and Architecture

Stickiness analysis is part of Amplitude's Metrics Module, which forms a core component of Amplitude's analytics platform. It works in conjunction with:

1. **Segmentation Module**: Allows filtering of stickiness analysis by user properties and behaviors
2. **Cohort Creation System**: Enables creation of user segments based on stickiness patterns
3. **Data Table Breakdowns**: Provides detailed numerical data to complement visual charts
4. **Retention Analysis**: Complements stickiness by providing different perspectives on user engagement

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Stickiness**: Measurement of how frequently users perform specific events over a defined time period
- **Cumulative Stickiness**: Analysis showing percentage of users who performed an event at least N days
- **Non-Cumulative Stickiness**: Analysis showing percentage of users who performed an event exactly N days
- **Microscope Feature**: Tool for detailed inspection of specific data points in stickiness charts
- **Behavioral Cohorts**: User groups created based on specific engagement patterns
- **Event Properties**: Attributes associated with events that can be used to filter analysis
- **Power Users**: Highly engaged users who perform key events more frequently than average

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Stickiness analysis serves as a critical component in Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem:

- It provides engagement metrics that complement retention analysis
- Findings from stickiness analysis can be used to create targeted user segments
- Stickiness metrics can be tracked over time to measure the impact of product changes
- Results can be shared across teams to align product strategy with user behavior data

## Usage Instructions

To create a Stickiness chart:
1. Navigate to the Stickiness chart in Amplitude
2. Select events to analyze
3. Choose a time period
4. Apply segmentation or filters
5. Select either cumulative or non-cumulative analysis method

For interpretation:
1. Examine user distribution across frequency levels
2. Compare patterns between segments
3. Track changes over time
4. Use Microscope to inspect specific data points
5. Create behavioral cohorts based on engagement patterns

Advanced analysis options include comparing weekly vs. monthly patterns, analyzing stickiness trends over time, and using segmentation to identify differences between user groups.
