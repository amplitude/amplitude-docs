## Amplitude Event Segmentation Analytics

Amplitude Event Segmentation is a comprehensive analytics tool that enables users to analyze user behavior patterns through customizable charts and measurements. The product allows for detailed examination of how users interact with events over time, providing insights through various visualization methods and measurement options.

## Product Relationships and Features

The Event Segmentation functionality is built around three core modules that work together:

**Events Module** serves as the foundation for selecting and configuring events, supporting both individual event selection and in-line custom events that combine multiple events using OR logic. This module integrates with event properties filtering and connects to the broader Amplitude ecosystem through features like Microscope integration.

**Measured As Module** provides the analytical engine with multiple measurement options including Uniques, Event Totals, Active percentages, Frequency analysis with customizable buckets, and property-based measurements (Sum, Distribution, Average, Distinct, Median). Advanced functionality includes custom formulas with 20+ formula types and aggregation methods like rolling averages, cumulative sums, and rolling windows.

**Segmentation Module** enables user segment definition and filtering, working in conjunction with the other modules to provide targeted analysis. This includes Group segment functionality and user segment filtering capabilities.

The system also features sophisticated visualization options including line charts, stacked area charts, bar charts (stacked, horizontal), and breakdown tables, with support for dual Y-axis configurations and custom Y-axis settings.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Event Segmentation Chart**: The primary visualization tool for analyzing user behavior patterns across events and time periods.

**Uniques vs Event Totals**: Core measurement distinction where Uniques counts distinct users performing events while Event Totals counts all event occurrences.

**In-line Custom Events**: Temporary event combinations using OR logic that don't require permanent saving, available in closed beta.

**Rolling Averages**: Unweighted mean smoothing technique for data visualization using the ROLLAVG formula.

**Cumulative Sum (CUMSUM)**: Running totals calculation that aggregates values over time periods.

**Rolling Windows (ROLLWIN)**: Aggregate sum calculations over specified time windows.

**Property Value Measurements**: Analysis based on event property integers including sum, distribution, average, distinct count, and median calculations.

**Real-time Segmentation**: Live data analysis with 5-minute caching intervals for current data.

**Period-over-period Comparison**: Historical data comparison functionality using "Compare to past" features.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Event Segmentation integrates deeply with the broader Amplitude Analytics platform through several touchpoints:

- **Data Table Charts**: Share custom formula functionality and measurement options
- **Funnel Charts**: Support in-line custom events with similar OR logic implementation  
- **User Sessions Chart**: Compatible with specific formula types and measurements
- **Microscope Feature**: Provides detailed drill-down capabilities (with some limitations for in-line events)
- **Custom Events System**: Allows conversion of in-line events to permanently saved custom events
- **HyperLogLog Algorithm**: Underlying technology for efficient unique user calculations

## Technical Implementation

The system supports extensive customization through:

**Custom Formulas Syntax**: Over 20 formula types including metrics (UNIQUES, TOTALS, PROPSUM), aggregation functions (ROLLAVG, CUMSUM, ROLLWIN), and mathematical functions (LOG, POWER, TRENDLINE) using event letter references and arithmetic operations.

**Chart Controls**: Comprehensive visualization options with switching between absolute totals and relative percentages, group-by conditions, and temporal visualization capabilities.

**Advanced Analytics**: ARPAU (Average Revenue Per Active User), HIST (histogram), PERCENTILE calculations, and ordinary least-squares regression through TRENDLINE functionality.

The Event Segmentation product represents a sophisticated analytics solution that bridges real-time data analysis with historical trend analysis, providing both technical depth through custom formulas and accessibility through intuitive visualization options.
