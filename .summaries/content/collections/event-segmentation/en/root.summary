# Event Segmentation in Amplitude

Event Segmentation is a core analytics capability in Amplitude that allows users to analyze and visualize user behavior data by tracking events and their properties over time. This feature enables product teams to understand how users interact with their products, identify patterns, and make data-driven decisions.

## Key Features and Concepts

- **Event Analysis**: Track and analyze specific user actions (events) within your product
- **Segmentation**: Break down user behavior by various properties and segments
- **Multiple Measurement Types**: Analyze data using different metrics like uniques, totals, averages, etc.
- **Customizable Visualizations**: View data through various chart types including line, bar, and stacked area charts
- **Advanced Analysis Tools**: Apply rolling averages, cumulative sums, and period-over-period comparisons
- **Custom Formulas**: Create complex calculations using mathematical operations on event data
- **In-line Event Creation**: Combine multiple events on-the-fly without creating permanent custom events

## Building Event Segmentation Charts

The Event Segmentation chart building process follows these steps:

1. **Select Events**: Choose the specific user actions you want to analyze
2. **Apply Properties**: Filter events based on their properties to focus on specific scenarios
3. **Choose Measurement Type**: Select how to quantify the events (uniques, totals, etc.)
4. **Segment Users**: Break down the analysis by user segments or properties
5. **Customize Visualization**: Select chart type and adjust display options

## Measurement Types

Event Segmentation offers several measurement options:

- **Uniques**: Count of unique users who performed an event (default)
- **Event Totals**: Total number of times an event occurred
- **Active %**: Percentage of users who performed an event out of total active users
- **Average**: Average number of times users performed an event
- **Frequency**: Distribution of users based on how many times they performed an event
- **Properties**: Measurements based on event property values:
  - Sum
  - Average
  - Minimum
  - Maximum
  - Percentiles
  - Histogram
- **Formula**: Custom calculations using mathematical operations

## Custom Formulas

Custom formulas allow for complex analyses by combining events and applying mathematical operations:

- **Metrics Formulas**: Basic operations on event metrics (e.g., `A + B`, `A / B`)
- **Aggregation Formulas**: Functions like `CUMSUM()` and `ROLLAVG()`
- **Function Formulas**: Advanced operations like `PROPSUM()` and `UNIQUES()`

Syntax example: `UNIQUES(A) / UNIQUES(B) * 100` to calculate conversion rate percentage.

## In-line Custom Events

In-line custom events allow users to:
- Combine multiple events using OR logic directly within charts
- Apply event property filters to these combined events
- Create temporary event combinations without creating permanent custom events
- Save frequently used combinations for reuse

## Visualization and Interpretation

Event Segmentation offers multiple visualization options:

- **Line Charts**: Track trends over time
- **Stacked Area Charts**: Show composition of total values
- **Bar Charts**: Compare discrete values
- **Stacked Bar Charts**: Compare composition across categories
- **Group-by Visualizations**: Add additional dimensions to analysis

The breakdown table provides detailed metrics for each segment, and users can toggle between absolute values and relative percentages.

## Advanced Analysis Features

- **Rolling Averages**: Smooth data by averaging values over a specified number of periods
- **Rolling Windows**: Aggregate data over custom time windows (days, weeks, months)
- **Cumulative Sum**: Display running totals over time
- **Real-time Segmentation**: View data as it comes in with minimal delay
- **Period-over-period Comparison**: Compare current data with previous time periods

## Integration in the Product Ecosystem

Event Segmentation serves as a foundational analysis tool within Amplitude's analytics platform. It provides the data visualization capabilities that support other features like Funnels, Retention, and Pathfinder. Insights from Event Segmentation can be:

- Saved to dashboards for ongoing monitoring
- Shared with team members
- Used to create cohorts for further analysis
- Exported for use in other tools

## Key Terminology

- **Events**: Specific user actions tracked in your product
- **Properties**: Attributes associated with events or users
- **Segments**: Groups of users based on behavior or characteristics
- **Measurement**: Method of quantifying event data
- **Breakdown Table**: Detailed metrics for each segment in the analysis
- **CUMSUM**: Cumulative sum function for running totals
- **ROLLAVG**: Rolling average function for data smoothing
- **Group-by**: Additional dimension for segmenting data
