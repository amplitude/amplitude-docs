# Amplitude Event Segmentation

## Product Overview

Event Segmentation is a core analytics feature within Amplitude that allows users to analyze user behavior by tracking and visualizing events across different segments. The product enables detailed analysis of how users interact with applications or services by breaking down event data across various dimensions, time periods, and measurement types.

### Key Features
- Event selection and combination capabilities
- Multiple measurement types (Uniques, Totals, Active %, etc.)
- Segmentation by user properties and behaviors
- Custom formula creation for complex analyses
- Various visualization options (line, bar, stacked area charts)
- Advanced data processing features (rolling averages, cumulative sums)
- Period-over-period comparisons
- Real-time data analysis

### Primary Use Cases
- Understanding user behavior patterns
- Comparing performance across different user segments
- Analyzing event frequency and engagement metrics
- Tracking custom property values over time
- Creating complex, multi-variable analyses through custom formulas
- Monitoring real-time user activity

## Product Relationships and Features

### Core Components
1. **Event Selection Module**: Allows users to select specific events to track and analyze, including the ability to create in-line custom events by combining multiple existing events.

2. **Measured As Module**: Provides different measurement options to analyze events:
   - Uniques (default): Counts unique users who performed an event
   - Event Totals: Counts total occurrences of an event
   - Active %: Shows percentage of active users
   - Average: Calculates average values
   - Frequency: Groups users by event frequency
   - Properties: Analyzes specific property values
   - Formula: Creates custom calculations

3. **Segmentation Module**: Enables breaking down events by user segments, properties, or behaviors.

4. **Visualization Options**: Provides multiple chart types:
   - Line charts
   - Bar charts
   - Stacked area charts
   - Stacked bar charts
   - Group-by visualizations for multi-dimensional analysis

5. **Advanced Analysis Features**:
   - Rolling Averages: Smooths data over time periods
   - Rolling Windows: Aggregates data over specified windows
   - Cumulative Sum: Shows running totals
   - Period-over-period comparison: Compares current data to historical periods
   - Real-time Segmentation: Analyzes data as it comes in

6. **Y-axis Customization**: Allows for dual Y-axes, custom ranges, and unit display formats.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: A specific user action or occurrence tracked in Amplitude
- **In-line Custom Events**: Temporary combinations of multiple events created directly within charts
- **Uniques**: Count of unique users who performed an event
- **Event Totals**: Total count of event occurrences
- **Active %**: Percentage of users who performed an event out of total active users
- **Breakdown Table**: Displays numerical data corresponding to chart visualizations
- **Group-by Conditions**: Additional dimensions for segmenting data
- **CUMSUM**: Cumulative sum function for running totals
- **ROLLAVG**: Rolling average function for data smoothing
- **ROLLWIN**: Rolling window function for period aggregation
- **Microscope Feature**: Allows drilling down into specific data points
- **Formula Syntax**: System for creating custom calculations using events and mathematical operations

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Event Segmentation appears to be a fundamental analysis tool within the broader Amplitude analytics platform. It integrates with:

1. **Amplitude's User Identification System**: Leverages user properties and segments for analysis
2. **Custom Event Tracking**: Works with both predefined and custom events
3. **Funnel Analysis**: In-line custom events can be used in both Event Segmentation and Funnel charts
4. **Data Tables**: Custom formulas work in both Event Segmentation and Data Table charts

## Technical Implementation

### Chart Building Process
1. Select events to analyze
2. Apply event properties for filtering
3. Choose measurement type
4. Apply segmentation
5. Customize visualization

### Custom Formula Syntax
Custom formulas use letter designations (A, B, C) to reference events and apply mathematical operations:
```
A + B       // Sum of events A and B
A - B       // Difference between events A and B
A / B * 100 // Percentage calculation
```

### Formula Types
- **Metrics Formulas**: Basic arithmetic operations (A+B, A-B, A/B)
- **Aggregation Formulas**: CUMSUM(A), ROLLAVG(A,7)
- **Function Formulas**: Complex operations like PROPSUM, ROLLWIN

### Real-time Analysis
The platform supports real-time segmentation for monitoring current user activity, with data refreshing automatically.

Event Segmentation serves as a powerful, flexible analytics tool within Amplitude, allowing users to create sophisticated analyses of user behavior through a combination of event selection, measurement options, segmentation capabilities, and visualization choices.
