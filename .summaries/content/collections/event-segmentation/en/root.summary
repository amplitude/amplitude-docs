## Amplitude Event Segmentation Analytics

Event Segmentation is a core analytics feature in Amplitude that enables users to analyze and visualize event data through customizable charts and measurements. This product allows organizations to track user behavior, measure engagement metrics, and gain insights into how users interact with their applications across different segments and time periods.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Event Segmentation product is built around four primary modules that work together to create comprehensive analytics charts:

**Events Module** serves as the foundation, allowing users to select specific events, apply event properties, and create in-line custom events using OR logic to combine multiple existing events without permanent storage. This module supports the "Any Event" selection and integrates with the broader Amplitude event taxonomy.

**Measured As Module** provides the analytical engine with multiple measurement types including Uniques (unique users), Event Totals, Active percentage calculations, Frequency analysis with customizable buckets, and property-based measurements (Sum, Distribution, Average, Distinct, Median). This module also supports advanced features like rolling averages, rolling windows, cumulative sums, and custom formulas.

**Segmentation Module** enables user segment definition and filtering, supporting multiple segmentation properties with group-by conditions for detailed behavioral analysis and cohort comparisons.

**Visualization Engine** renders data through various chart types including line charts with dual Y-axis support, stacked area charts, bar charts (horizontal and vertical), pie charts, and KPI grids, with options to switch between absolute totals and relative percentages.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Event Segmentation Chart**: The primary visualization tool for analyzing event data across user segments and time periods.

**Uniques vs Event Totals**: Core measurement distinction where Uniques counts distinct users performing events while Event Totals counts all event occurrences.

**In-line Custom Events**: Temporary event combinations using OR logic that exist only within the current chart context, available in closed beta.

**Custom Formulas**: Advanced analytical expressions using 20+ formula types including metrics (UNIQUES, TOTALS, PROPSUM), aggregation functions (ROLLAVG, CUMSUM, ROLLWIN), and mathematical functions (LOG, POWER, TRENDLINE) with event letter references.

**Active Percentage**: Measurement showing the percentage of users in a segment who performed specific events.

**Rolling Windows**: Time-based aggregation that smooths data over specified intervals with configurable limits (36 five-minute intervals, 72 hours, 90 days, 12 weeks, 12 months).

**Period-over-Period Comparison**: Feature enabling temporal analysis by comparing current data against historical periods using offset date pickers.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Event Segmentation integrates deeply with the broader Amplitude Analytics platform, connecting to Data Table charts for tabular analysis and User Sessions charts for session-based metrics. The product supports the Microscope feature for detailed event inspection, though with limitations for in-line custom events.

Custom formulas functionality is available on Plus, Growth, and Enterprise plans, indicating tiered feature access within Amplitude's pricing structure. The product supports real-time segmentation capabilities and integrates with Amplitude's cohort system for before/after cohort filtering.

## Technical Implementation

The product utilizes event letter references (A, B, C, etc.) for formula construction and supports arithmetic operations for complex analytical expressions. Property grouping enables detailed segmentation analysis, while the dual Y-axis functionality allows for comparative visualization of different metrics on line charts.

Time interval processing includes automatic data aggregation with unique user deduplication across rolling windows, and the system supports both absolute and relative percentage calculations for stacked visualizations. The breakdown table feature provides detailed numerical analysis complementing the visual chart representations.
