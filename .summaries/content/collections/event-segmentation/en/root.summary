## Amplitude Event Segmentation Analytics

Amplitude Event Segmentation is a comprehensive analytics tool that enables users to analyze user behavior and event data through customizable charts and visualizations. The product provides deep insights into how users interact with applications by measuring events, segmenting users, and applying various analytical functions to understand patterns and trends.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

Event Segmentation operates through four core modules that work together to create analytical charts:

**Events Module** serves as the foundation, allowing users to select specific events, apply event properties as filters, and create in-line custom events using OR logic to combine multiple existing events without permanent storage. This module supports the "Any Event" selection and integrates with the broader Amplitude event taxonomy.

**Measured As Module** provides the analytical engine with multiple measurement types including Uniques (distinct users), Event Totals (raw event counts), Active percentage calculations, Frequency analysis with customizable buckets, and property-based measurements (Sum, Distribution, Average, Distinct, Median). This module also supports advanced features like rolling averages, rolling windows, cumulative sums, and real-time segmentation.

**Segmentation Module** enables user cohort analysis by defining segments based on user properties, behaviors, or custom criteria. It supports multiple segmentation properties simultaneously and offers both before/after cohort filtering capabilities.

**Visualization Engine** transforms the analytical output into various chart types including line charts with dual Y-axis support, stacked area charts, bar charts (horizontal and vertical), pie charts, and KPI grids, with the ability to switch between absolute totals and relative percentages.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Event Segmentation Chart**: The primary visualization tool for analyzing event data across user segments and time periods.

**Uniques vs Event Totals**: Fundamental measurement distinction where Uniques counts distinct users performing events while Event Totals counts raw event occurrences.

**In-line Custom Events**: Temporary event combinations using OR logic that exist only within the current chart context, convertible to permanent custom events.

**Rolling Windows**: Time-based aggregation functions that smooth data over specified intervals (5-minute, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly) with specific limits (36 five-minute intervals, 72 hours, 90 days, 12 weeks, 12 months).

**Active Percentage**: Calculated metric showing the percentage of users in a segment who performed specific events.

**Property-based Measurements**: Analytics applied to event or user properties including PROPSUM, distribution analysis, and statistical functions.

**Period-over-Period Comparison**: Temporal analysis feature enabling comparison of current data against historical periods using offset date pickers.

## Custom Formulas and Advanced Analytics

The platform supports 20+ custom formula types organized into three categories:

**Metrics Formulas**: UNIQUES, TOTALS, PROPSUM for basic event and property calculations
**Aggregation Formulas**: ROLLAVG, CUMSUM, PERCENTILE for time-series analysis
**Function Formulas**: LOG, POWER, TRENDLINE using ordinary least-squares regression

Formulas use event letter referencing (A, B, C) and support complex calculations like ARPAU (Average Revenue Per Active User). The system employs HyperLogLog algorithms for efficient unique user calculations and supports SEMANTICTOTALS for array property analysis.

## Integration with Broader Amplitude Ecosystem

Event Segmentation integrates deeply with Amplitude's analytics suite, sharing event data with Funnel Charts and connecting to the Microscope feature for detailed user journey analysis. The tool supports User Sessions chart formulas and maintains consistency with Amplitude's broader event taxonomy and user property systems.

Charts can be converted between different visualization types and support real-time data analysis with specific refresh intervals. The segmentation data feeds into other Amplitude products for cohort analysis and user behavior tracking.

## Technical Implementation

The system processes data through configurable time intervals and supports both real-time and historical analysis. Rolling window calculations maintain data integrity through deduplication algorithms, particularly for unique user counts across overlapping time periods. The platform handles large-scale data aggregation while maintaining query performance through optimized data structures and caching mechanisms.

Breakdown tables provide detailed data exploration capabilities, allowing users to drill down from high-level visualizations into granular event and user data. The dual Y-axis functionality enables comparison of metrics with different scales within single visualizations.
