## Product Overview

Event Segmentation is a core analytics feature within Amplitude Analytics that enables users to analyze user behavior patterns through customizable charts and visualizations. The product allows analysts to track events, measure user engagement, and segment audiences based on various properties and behaviors. Event Segmentation serves as a foundational tool for understanding how users interact with products over time, supporting both real-time and historical analysis with sophisticated measurement capabilities.

## Product Relationships and Features

Event Segmentation operates through four primary modules that work together to create comprehensive analytics charts:

**Events Module** serves as the foundation, allowing users to select specific events and their properties for analysis. This module supports in-line custom events using OR logic to combine multiple existing events without permanent storage, and integrates with the broader Amplitude event taxonomy.

**Measured As Module** provides the analytical engine with multiple measurement types including Uniques (user counts), Event Totals (occurrence counts), Active percentages, Frequency analysis with customizable buckets, and property-based measurements (Sum, Distribution, Average, Distinct, Median). This module also supports advanced features like rolling averages, rolling windows, and cumulative sums.

**Segmentation Module** enables audience definition and filtering through user segments and properties, allowing for granular analysis of specific user cohorts and behavioral patterns.

**Visualization Engine** renders data through multiple chart types including line charts, stacked area charts, bar charts, stacked bar charts, and horizontal bar charts, with support for dual Y-axis configurations and both absolute and relative percentage views.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Event Segmentation Chart**: The primary visualization tool for analyzing user behavior patterns across events and time periods.

**Uniques vs Event Totals**: Core measurement distinction where Uniques count distinct users performing events while Event Totals count total event occurrences.

**In-line Custom Events**: Temporary event combinations using OR logic that exist only within specific charts without permanent storage in the event taxonomy.

**Rolling Averages**: Unweighted mean smoothing technique for data visualization over specified time windows.

**Rolling Windows**: Aggregate sum calculations across defined time periods for trend analysis.

**Cumulative Sum (CUMSUM)**: Running totals that accumulate values over time, particularly useful for revenue and growth tracking.

**Active Percentage**: Measurement showing the percentage of users performing specific events within defined time periods.

**Property-based Measurements**: Analytics functions (Sum, Distribution, Average, Distinct, Median) applied to event or user properties for deeper behavioral insights.

**Group-by Conditions**: Segmentation criteria that break down data by specific properties or user characteristics.

**Breakdown Table**: Tabular representation of chart data showing detailed metrics and comparisons.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Event Segmentation integrates deeply with the broader Amplitude Analytics ecosystem through several key connections:

**Data Table Charts** share custom formula capabilities and measurement methodologies with Event Segmentation, providing complementary tabular analysis views.

**Funnel Charts** utilize the same in-line custom event functionality, creating consistency across conversion analysis workflows.

**User Sessions Charts** leverage similar formula syntax and measurement approaches for session-based analytics.

**Microscope Feature** integrates with Event Segmentation for detailed user-level analysis, though with some limitations for in-line custom events.

**Real-time Analytics** operates with 5-minute data caching for current segmentation analysis, connecting to Amplitude's real-time data processing infrastructure.

## Technical Implementation Details

**Custom Formulas Syntax**: Event Segmentation supports 20+ formula types with specific syntax requirements using event letter references (A, B, C, etc.) for complex calculations including UNIQUES, TOTALS, PROPSUM, ROLLAVG, CUMSUM, ROLLWIN, TRENDLINE, PERCENTILE, ARPAU, and HIST formulas.

**HyperLogLog Algorithm**: Underlying technology for efficient unique user counting in large datasets.

**Period-over-Period Comparisons**: Built-in functionality for comparing current metrics against historical periods using the "Compare to past" feature.

**Y-axis Customization**: Custom Y-axis modal for dual Y-axis support in line charts, enabling comparison of different metric scales.

**Formula Integration**: Arithmetic operations support including LOG, POWER functions, ordinary least-squares regression for trendlines, and cohort comparison capabilities.

The Event Segmentation product represents a comprehensive behavioral analytics solution that bridges event tracking, user segmentation, and advanced statistical analysis within Amplitude's unified analytics platform.
