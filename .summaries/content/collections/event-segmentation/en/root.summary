## Amplitude Event Segmentation Analytics

Amplitude Event Segmentation is a comprehensive analytics tool that enables users to analyze user behavior patterns through customizable charts and measurements. The product provides deep insights into how users interact with applications by tracking events, measuring user engagement, and segmenting audiences based on various criteria.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Event Segmentation system is built around three core modules that work together to create comprehensive analytics charts:

**Events Module** serves as the foundation, allowing users to select specific events and their properties for analysis. This module supports both individual event selection and in-line custom events that combine multiple events using OR logic without permanent storage.

**Measured As Module** provides the analytical engine with multiple measurement options including Uniques (distinct users), Event Totals, Active percentages, Frequency distributions with customizable buckets, and property-based measurements (Sum, Distribution, Average, Distinct, Median). An Advanced dropdown extends functionality with custom formulas and specialized calculations.

**Segmentation Module** enables user segment definition and filtering, allowing analysts to break down data by user properties and create targeted audience analysis through Group segment by functionality.

These modules integrate with visualization components supporting multiple chart types (line, stacked area, bar, stacked bar, horizontal bar) and advanced features like dual Y-axis support, breakdown tables, and real-time data processing with 5-minute caching intervals.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Event Segmentation Chart**: The primary visualization tool for analyzing user behavior patterns across different events and time periods.

**Uniques vs Event Totals**: Core measurement distinction where Uniques counts distinct users performing events while Event Totals counts all event occurrences including repeats by the same user.

**In-line Custom Events**: Temporary event combinations using OR logic that exist only within the current chart context, convertible to permanent saved custom events.

**Rolling Averages**: Unweighted mean smoothing calculations that reduce noise in time-series data.

**Rolling Windows**: Aggregate summing functionality that combines data points across specified time periods.

**Cumulative Sum (CUMSUM)**: Running totals that accumulate values over time periods for trend analysis.

**Property Value Measurements**: Analytics applied to event properties including Sum, Distribution, Average, Distinct count, and Median calculations.

**Period-over-Period Comparison**: Temporal analysis feature enabling comparison between current and historical time periods with configurable intervals.

**Microscope Integration**: Deep-dive analysis tool that works with segmentation charts for detailed user behavior examination.

## Custom Formulas and Advanced Analytics

The system supports 20+ custom formula types with specific syntax requirements:

**Metrics Formulas**: UNIQUES, TOTALS, PROPSUM for basic event and property calculations
**Aggregation Formulas**: ROLLAVG, CUMSUM, ROLLWIN for time-series analysis
**Function Formulas**: LOG, POWER, TRENDLINE for mathematical transformations and trend analysis
**Specialized Formulas**: ARPAU (Average Revenue Per Active User), HIST (histogram), PERCENTILE for business and statistical metrics

Formulas use event letter references (A, B, C) and support arithmetic operations, with integration across Event Segmentation, Data Table, and User Sessions charts.

## Ecosystem Integration

Event Segmentation integrates with the broader Amplitude Analytics platform through several touchpoints:

- **Funnel Charts**: Share in-line custom event functionality for conversion analysis
- **Data Table Charts**: Support identical custom formula syntax and measurements
- **User Sessions**: Compatible with formula-based analysis
- **Microscope Tool**: Provides drill-down capabilities from segmentation charts
- **Real-time Processing**: 5-minute data caching ensures near real-time analytics across the platform

The system supports both absolute totals and relative percentage views, enabling flexible analysis approaches. Advanced features include dotted line indicators for current day data, percentage change toggles for period comparisons, and HyperLogLog algorithm implementation for efficient unique user counting at scale.

Event Segmentation serves as a foundational analytics component that connects user behavior tracking with advanced statistical analysis, providing the analytical backbone for data-driven decision making within the Amplitude ecosystem.
