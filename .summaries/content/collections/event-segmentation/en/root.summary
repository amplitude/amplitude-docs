## Amplitude Event Segmentation

Event Segmentation is a core analytics feature in Amplitude that enables users to analyze user behavior patterns and event data through flexible measurement and visualization capabilities. This product allows organizations to track, measure, and understand how users interact with their applications by examining specific events, user segments, and behavioral metrics over time.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Event Segmentation product is built around four primary modules that work together to create comprehensive behavioral analyses:

**Events Module** serves as the foundation, allowing users to select specific events and their properties for analysis. This module supports both standard event selection and in-line custom events that combine multiple existing events using OR logic without permanently saving them.

**Measured As Module** provides the analytical engine with multiple measurement types including Uniques (unique users), Event Totals, Active percentages, Frequency distributions, Property-based measurements (sum, distribution, average, distinct, median), and custom formulas. This module also handles advanced temporal analysis through rolling averages, rolling windows, cumulative sums, and period-over-period comparisons.

**Segmentation Module** enables user segment definition and filtering, allowing analysts to break down data by specific user characteristics or behaviors and apply group-by conditions with multiple segmentation properties.

**Visualization Engine** transforms the analytical results into various chart types including line charts, stacked area charts, bar charts, pie charts, and KPI grids, with support for dual Y-axis configurations and switching between absolute totals and relative percentages.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Event Segmentation Chart**: The primary visualization tool for analyzing user behavior patterns and event data across different segments and time periods.

**Uniques vs Event Totals**: Fundamental measurement distinction where Uniques counts distinct users performing events while Event Totals counts all event occurrences regardless of user repetition.

**In-line Custom Events**: Temporary event combinations using OR logic that exist only within the current analysis without being permanently saved to the event taxonomy.

**Rolling Windows**: Time-based aggregation that smooths data by calculating metrics across specified time intervals (supporting up to 36 five-minute intervals, 72 hours, 90 days, 12 weeks, or 12 months).

**Active Percentage**: Measurement showing the percentage of users in a segment who performed specific events during the analysis period.

**Custom Formulas**: Advanced analytical expressions supporting 20+ formula types including metrics (UNIQUES, TOTALS, PROPSUM), aggregation functions (ROLLAVG, CUMSUM), and mathematical functions (LOG, POWER, TRENDLINE) with event letter referencing syntax.

**Cohort Filtering**: Temporal segmentation capability allowing before/after cohort filter analysis for understanding user behavior changes over time.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Event Segmentation integrates deeply with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem through several key connections:

**Microscope Integration**: Provides drill-down capabilities from Event Segmentation charts to examine individual user behaviors, though with limitations for in-line custom events.

**Data Table Charts**: Share custom formula capabilities with Event Segmentation, enabling consistent analytical approaches across different visualization types.

**Funnel Charts**: Support in-line custom events functionality, creating analytical consistency across conversion analysis workflows.

**User Sessions Charts**: Utilize compatible formula structures, enabling cross-chart analytical coherence.

**Real-time Analytics**: Event Segmentation supports real-time data analysis with specific time interval constraints for live behavioral monitoring.

## Technical Implementation Details

The product leverages several technical approaches for data processing and analysis:

**HyperLogLog Algorithm**: Used for efficient unique user counting in large-scale data environments.

**Ordinary Least-Squares Regression**: Powers trendline calculations in custom formulas for predictive analysis.

**Event Letter Referencing**: Systematic approach to referencing events in custom formulas using alphabetical identifiers.

**SEMANTICTOTALS**: Specialized handling for array properties in formula calculations.

**Property Grouping Validation**: Ensures analytical integrity when combining multiple segmentation properties.

The Event Segmentation product represents Amplitude's core behavioral analytics capability, providing the foundational tools for understanding user engagement patterns, measuring product performance, and driving data-informed decision-making across organizations.
