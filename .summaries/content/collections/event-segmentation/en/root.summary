## Amplitude Event Segmentation Analytics

Amplitude Event Segmentation is a comprehensive analytics tool that enables users to analyze user behavior patterns through customizable charts and visualizations. The product allows organizations to track, measure, and interpret user interactions with their applications by segmenting events based on various properties and metrics.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Event Segmentation product is built around four core modules that work together to create comprehensive analytics charts:

**Events Module** serves as the foundation, allowing users to select specific events and their properties for analysis. This module supports in-line custom event creation using OR logic to combine multiple existing events without permanent storage, and integrates with the broader Amplitude ecosystem through saved custom events.

**Measured As Module** provides the analytical engine with multiple measurement options including Uniques (distinct users), Event Totals (raw event counts), Active percentages, Frequency analysis with customizable buckets, and property-based measurements (Sum, Distribution, Average, Distinct, Median). This module also supports advanced features like rolling averages, rolling windows, and cumulative sums.

**Segmentation Module** enables user segment definition and filtering, supporting both user properties and behavioral segments with "Group segment by" functionality for multi-dimensional analysis.

**Visualization Engine** transforms the data into various chart types including line charts (with dual Y-axis support), stacked area charts, bar charts, pie charts, and KPI grids, with breakdown tables for detailed analysis.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Event Segmentation Chart**: The primary visualization tool for analyzing user behavior patterns across different segments and time periods.

**Uniques vs Event Totals**: Core measurement distinction where Uniques counts distinct users performing events while Event Totals counts raw event occurrences.

**In-line Custom Events**: Temporary event combinations using OR logic that exist only within the current chart context, available in closed beta.

**Rolling Averages**: Unweighted mean smoothing technique for data trend analysis over specified time windows.

**Rolling Windows**: Aggregate sum calculations over moving time periods for pattern identification.

**Cumulative Sum (CUMSUM)**: Running totals that accumulate values over time, particularly useful for revenue and growth tracking.

**Property-based Measurements**: Analytics based on event or user property values rather than simple event counts.

**Group-by Conditions**: Multi-dimensional segmentation allowing analysis across multiple properties simultaneously.

**Real-time Segmentation**: Live data analysis with 5-minute caching intervals for current user behavior insights.

## Ecosystem Integration

Event Segmentation integrates deeply with the broader Amplitude Analytics platform through several touchpoints:

- **Data Table Charts**: Share custom formula syntax and measurement capabilities
- **Funnel Charts**: Support in-line custom events with identical OR logic functionality  
- **User Sessions Charts**: Compatible with custom formula applications
- **Microscope Feature**: Provides drill-down capabilities for detailed user journey analysis
- **Custom Events System**: Allows conversion of in-line events to permanently saved custom events
- **HyperLogLog Algorithm**: Underlying technology for efficient unique user calculations at scale

## Technical Implementation

**Custom Formulas Syntax**: The product supports 20+ formula types with specific syntax requirements using event letter references (A, B, C, etc.) for complex calculations including:
- Metrics formulas: `UNIQUES(A)`, `TOTALS(A)`, `PROPSUM(A)`
- Aggregation formulas: `ROLLAVG(A,7)`, `CUMSUM(A)`, `ROLLWIN(A,30)`
- Function formulas: `LOG(A)`, `POWER(A,2)`, `TRENDLINE(A)`

**API Integration**: While specific endpoints aren't detailed in the documentation, the system supports real-time data processing with 5-minute cache refresh intervals and integrates with Amplitude's broader data ingestion pipeline.

**Chart Controls**: Interactive elements including period-over-period comparisons, absolute vs relative percentage switching for stacked visualizations, and custom Y-axis configuration including dual Y-axis support for line charts.

The product serves as a central analytics hub within Amplitude's ecosystem, providing the foundational event analysis capabilities that feed into more specialized tools like cohort analysis, retention tracking, and conversion funnel optimization.
