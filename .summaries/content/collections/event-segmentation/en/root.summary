## Amplitude Event Segmentation Analytics

Event Segmentation is a core analytics feature in Amplitude that enables users to analyze and visualize event data through customizable charts and measurements. This product allows teams to track user behavior patterns, measure engagement metrics, and segment users based on various properties and actions within their applications.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Event Segmentation product is built around four primary modules that work together to create comprehensive analytics visualizations:

**Events Module** serves as the foundation, allowing users to select specific events and their properties for analysis. This module supports both individual event selection and in-line custom events that combine multiple events using OR logic without permanently saving them.

**Measured As Module** provides the analytical engine with multiple measurement options including Uniques (unique users), Event Totals, Active percentages, Frequency analysis with customizable buckets, and property-based measurements (Sum, Distribution, Average, Distinct, Median). This module also supports advanced features like rolling averages, rolling windows, cumulative sums, and real-time segmentation.

**Segmentation Module** enables user filtering and grouping capabilities, allowing analysts to define user segments and apply Group segment by conditions with multiple segmentation properties for deeper behavioral insights.

**Visualization Engine** transforms the data into various chart types including line charts, stacked area charts, bar charts, pie charts, and KPI grids, with support for dual Y-axis configurations and the ability to switch between absolute totals and relative percentages.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Event Segmentation Chart**: The primary visualization tool for analyzing event data across different user segments and time periods.

**Uniques vs Event Totals**: Core measurement distinction where Uniques counts distinct users performing events while Event Totals counts all event occurrences.

**In-line Custom Events**: Temporary event combinations using OR logic that exist only within the current chart without being permanently saved to the taxonomy.

**Custom Formulas**: Advanced analytical expressions using 20+ formula types including metrics (UNIQUES, TOTALS, PROPSUM), aggregation functions (ROLLAVG, CUMSUM, ROLLWIN), and mathematical functions (LOG, POWER, TRENDLINE) with specific syntax requirements and event letter references.

**Rolling Windows (ROLLWIN)**: Time-based aggregation that calculates metrics over moving time periods for data smoothing and trend analysis.

**Breakdown Table**: Tabular representation of chart data that accompanies visualizations for detailed numerical analysis.

**Group-by Conditions**: Segmentation logic that allows multiple property-based user groupings within a single analysis.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Event Segmentation integrates deeply with Amplitude's broader analytics platform through several key connections:

- **Microscope Feature**: Provides drill-down capabilities for detailed user journey analysis, though with limitations for in-line custom events
- **Data Table Charts**: Share custom formula syntax and measurement capabilities with Event Segmentation
- **Funnel Charts**: Support in-line custom events functionality for conversion analysis
- **User Sessions Chart**: Compatible with custom formula applications
- **Cohort Analysis**: Integrates through cohort filtering and comparison features
- **Real-time Analytics**: Supports live data segmentation with specific time interval limitations

## Technical Implementation Details

The product utilizes the **HyperLogLog algorithm** for efficient unique user counting at scale. Custom formulas support **arithmetic operations** and **ordinary least-squares regression** for trendline analysis. The system implements **unweighted mean calculations** for rolling averages and supports **period-over-period comparisons** with configurable time ranges.

**Formula Syntax**: Uses event letter references (A, B, C, etc.) to represent different events in mathematical expressions, enabling complex analytical calculations across multiple event types.

**Data Aggregation**: Employs sophisticated deduplication logic for unique users across different time intervals while maintaining accuracy in cumulative and rolling calculations.

The Event Segmentation product represents Amplitude's core event analytics capability, providing the foundational tools for understanding user behavior patterns and measuring product engagement across diverse user segments and time periods.
