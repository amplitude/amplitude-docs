# Event Segmentation in Amplitude

Event Segmentation is a core analytics feature in Amplitude that allows users to analyze and visualize user behavior data by tracking specific events and their properties over time. This powerful tool helps product teams understand how users interact with their products and identify patterns in user behavior.

## Key Features and Concepts

- **Event Analysis**: Track and analyze specific user actions (events) within your product
- **Segmentation**: Break down user behavior by different properties and segments
- **Multiple Measurement Types**: Analyze data using various metrics like uniques, totals, averages, etc.
- **Customizable Visualizations**: View data through different chart types and visualization options
- **Advanced Analysis Tools**: Apply rolling averages, cumulative sums, and period-over-period comparisons
- **Custom Formulas**: Create complex calculations using mathematical operations on event data
- **In-line Custom Events**: Combine multiple events directly within charts without creating permanent custom events

## Building Event Segmentation Charts

The Event Segmentation tool follows a structured workflow:

1. **Select Events**: Choose the specific user actions you want to analyze
2. **Apply Properties**: Filter events based on specific characteristics or conditions
3. **Choose Measurement Type**: Select how to quantify the events (uniques, totals, etc.)
4. **Segment Users**: Break down results by user segments or properties
5. **Customize Visualization**: Select chart type and adjust display options

## Measurement Types

Event Segmentation offers several measurement options:

- **Uniques**: Count of unique users who performed an event (default)
- **Event Totals**: Total number of times an event occurred
- **Active %**: Percentage of users who performed an event out of total active users
- **Average**: Average number of times users performed an event
- **Frequency**: Distribution of users based on how often they perform an event
- **Properties**: Analyze numeric property values with options like:
  - Sum
  - Average
  - Minimum
  - Maximum
  - Percentiles
- **Formula**: Create custom calculations using mathematical operations

## Custom Formulas

Custom formulas allow for complex analyses by combining events and applying mathematical operations:

- **Metrics Formulas**: Basic mathematical operations on events (A+B, A-B, A/B, etc.)
- **Aggregation Formulas**: Functions like CUMSUM (cumulative sum) and ROLLAVG (rolling average)
- **Function Formulas**: Special functions for specific calculations

Syntax example: `UNIQUES(A) / UNIQUES(B) * 100` to calculate the percentage of users who performed event A out of those who performed event B.

## In-line Custom Events

This beta feature allows users to:
- Combine multiple events using OR logic directly within charts
- Apply filters and properties to these combined events
- Create temporary event combinations without permanent custom events
- Use these combinations in both event segmentation and funnel analyses

## Visualization and Interpretation

Event Segmentation offers multiple visualization options:

- **Line Charts**: Track trends over time
- **Stacked Area Charts**: Show proportional contribution of segments
- **Bar Charts**: Compare discrete categories
- **Stacked Bar Charts**: Compare segments within categories
- **Group-by Visualizations**: Analyze complex relationships between multiple properties

Additional analysis features include:

- **Rolling Averages**: Smooth out cyclical data using unweighted means
- **Rolling Windows**: Aggregate data over specific time periods (7-day, 28-day)
- **Cumulative Sum**: Display running totals over time
- **Real-time Segmentation**: View data as it comes in
- **Period-over-period Comparison**: Compare current data with previous time periods

## Y-axis Customization

The Y-axis can be customized with:
- **Dual Y-axes**: Display two different metrics on separate scales
- **Custom Ranges**: Set specific minimum and maximum values
- **Unit Display Formats**: Show values as percentages, currency, etc.

## Integration in the Amplitude Ecosystem

Event Segmentation serves as a foundational analysis tool within Amplitude's broader analytics platform. It provides the basic building blocks for understanding user behavior that can then feed into more complex analyses like funnels, retention, and cohort analysis. The insights gained from Event Segmentation can inform product decisions, feature prioritization, and user experience improvements.
