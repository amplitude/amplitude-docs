## Amplitude Event Segmentation Analytics

Event Segmentation is Amplitude's core analytics feature that enables comprehensive analysis and visualization of user behavior through customizable charts and measurements. The product allows teams to track behavioral patterns, measure engagement metrics, and segment users based on properties and actions within their applications, serving as the foundation for data-driven product decisions.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

Event Segmentation operates through four interconnected modules that create a comprehensive analytics framework:

The **Events Module** forms the analytical foundation, supporting individual event selection and in-line custom events that combine multiple events using OR logic without permanent taxonomy storage. This module enables flexible event analysis without cluttering the data structure.

The **Measured As Module** provides the analytical engine with diverse measurement capabilities including Uniques (distinct users), Event Totals (all occurrences), Active percentages, Frequency analysis with customizable buckets, and property-based measurements (Sum, Distribution, Average, Distinct, Median). Advanced features include rolling averages, rolling windows, cumulative sums, and real-time segmentation capabilities.

The **Segmentation Module** delivers user filtering and grouping functionality, enabling analysts to define user segments and apply Group segment by conditions with multiple segmentation properties for granular behavioral insights.

The **Visualization Engine** transforms analytical data into multiple chart formats including line charts, stacked area charts, bar charts, pie charts, and KPI grids, supporting dual Y-axis configurations and toggling between absolute totals and relative percentages.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Event Segmentation Chart** represents the primary visualization tool for analyzing event data across user segments and time periods.

**Uniques vs Event Totals** establishes the fundamental measurement distinction where Uniques counts distinct users performing events while Event Totals counts all event occurrences.

**In-line Custom Events** are temporary event combinations using OR logic that exist only within the current chart without permanent taxonomy storage.

**Custom Formulas** comprise advanced analytical expressions using 20+ formula types including metrics (UNIQUES, TOTALS, PROPSUM), aggregation functions (ROLLAVG, CUMSUM, ROLLWIN), and mathematical functions (LOG, POWER, TRENDLINE) with specific syntax requirements and event letter references.

**Rolling Windows (ROLLWIN)** provide time-based aggregation calculating metrics over moving time periods for data smoothing and trend analysis.

**Breakdown Table** delivers tabular representation of chart data accompanying visualizations for detailed numerical analysis.

**Group-by Conditions** enable segmentation logic allowing multiple property-based user groupings within single analyses.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Event Segmentation integrates extensively with Amplitude's analytics platform through multiple touchpoints:

**Microscope Feature** integration provides drill-down capabilities for detailed user journey analysis, though with limitations for in-line custom events. **Data Table Charts** share custom formula syntax and measurement capabilities. **Funnel Charts** support in-line custom events functionality for conversion analysis, while **User Sessions Charts** maintain compatibility with custom formula applications.

**Cohort Analysis** integration occurs through cohort filtering and comparison features, and **Real-time Analytics** supports live data segmentation with specific time interval limitations. This interconnected ecosystem ensures consistent analytical capabilities across Amplitude's feature set.

## Technical Implementation and Specifications

The product leverages the **HyperLogLog algorithm** for efficient unique user counting at scale. Custom formulas support **arithmetic operations** and **ordinary least-squares regression** for trendline analysis. The system implements **unweighted mean calculations** for rolling averages and supports **period-over-period comparisons** with configurable time ranges.

**Formula Syntax** utilizes event letter references (A, B, C, etc.) representing different events in mathematical expressions, enabling complex analytical calculations across multiple event types. **Data Aggregation** employs sophisticated deduplication logic for unique users across different time intervals while maintaining accuracy in cumulative and rolling calculations.

Event Segmentation represents Amplitude's foundational event analytics capability, providing essential tools for understanding user behavior patterns and measuring product engagement across diverse user segments and time periods within the broader analytics ecosystem.
