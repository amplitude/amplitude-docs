# Amplitude Event Segmentation

## Product Overview

Event Segmentation is a core analytics feature within Amplitude that enables detailed analysis of user behavior by tracking and visualizing events across different segments. The product allows users to break down event data across various dimensions, time periods, and measurement types to gain insights into how users interact with applications or services.

Event Segmentation provides powerful capabilities for analyzing user behavior patterns, comparing performance across different user segments, tracking engagement metrics, monitoring property values over time, creating complex multi-variable analyses, and observing real-time user activity.

## Product Relationships and Features

Event Segmentation consists of several interconnected components that work together to provide comprehensive analytics capabilities:

### Event Selection Module
Users can select specific events to track and analyze, with the ability to create in-line custom events by combining multiple existing events. This allows for flexible analysis without permanently modifying the event taxonomy.

### Measured As Module
This component offers various measurement options for analyzing events:
- **Uniques (default)**: Counts unique users who performed an event
- **Event Totals**: Counts total occurrences of an event
- **Active %**: Shows percentage of active users who performed an event
- **Average**: Calculates average values for numeric properties
- **Frequency**: Groups users by how frequently they perform an event
- **Properties**: Analyzes specific property values associated with events
- **Formula**: Creates custom calculations using mathematical operations

### Segmentation Module
Enables breaking down events by user segments, properties, or behaviors to compare performance across different user groups.

### Visualization Options
Provides multiple chart types to represent data:
- Line charts
- Bar charts
- Stacked area charts
- Stacked bar charts
- Group-by visualizations for multi-dimensional analysis

### Advanced Analysis Features
- **Rolling Averages**: Smooths data over specified time periods
- **Rolling Windows**: Aggregates data over custom time windows
- **Cumulative Sum**: Shows running totals over time
- **Period-over-period comparison**: Compares current data to historical periods
- **Real-time Segmentation**: Analyzes data as it arrives in the system

### Y-axis Customization
Allows for dual Y-axes, custom ranges, and unit display formats to better visualize and compare different metrics.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: A specific user action or occurrence tracked in Amplitude
- **In-line Custom Events**: Temporary combinations of multiple events created directly within charts
- **Uniques**: Count of unique users who performed an event
- **Event Totals**: Total count of event occurrences
- **Active %**: Percentage of users who performed an event out of total active users
- **Breakdown Table**: Displays numerical data corresponding to chart visualizations
- **Group-by Conditions**: Additional dimensions for segmenting data
- **CUMSUM**: Cumulative sum function for calculating running totals
- **ROLLAVG**: Rolling average function for smoothing data
- **ROLLWIN**: Rolling window function for period aggregation
- **Microscope Feature**: Tool for drilling down into specific data points
- **Formula Syntax**: System for creating custom calculations using events and mathematical operations

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Event Segmentation is a fundamental analysis tool within the broader Amplitude analytics platform. It integrates with:

1. **Amplitude's User Identification System**: Leverages user properties and segments for analysis
2. **Custom Event Tracking**: Works with both predefined and custom events
3. **Funnel Analysis**: In-line custom events created in Event Segmentation can be used in Funnel charts
4. **Data Tables**: Custom formulas work across both Event Segmentation and Data Table charts

## Technical Implementation

### Chart Building Process
The typical workflow for creating an Event Segmentation analysis involves:
1. Selecting events to analyze
2. Applying event properties for filtering
3. Choosing the appropriate measurement type
4. Applying segmentation parameters
5. Customizing visualization options

### Custom Formula Syntax
Custom formulas use letter designations (A, B, C) to reference events and apply mathematical operations:
```
A + B       // Sum of events A and B
A - B       // Difference between events A and B
A / B * 100 // Percentage calculation
```

### Formula Types
- **Metrics Formulas**: Basic arithmetic operations (A+B, A-B, A/B)
- **Aggregation Formulas**: CUMSUM(A), ROLLAVG(A,7)
- **Function Formulas**: Complex operations like PROPSUM, ROLLWIN

### Real-time Analysis
The platform supports real-time segmentation for monitoring current user activity, with data refreshing automatically to provide up-to-date insights.
