# Amplitude Event Segmentation

## Overview

Amplitude Event Segmentation is an advanced analytics tool designed to help users analyze and visualize user behavior patterns through event tracking. The platform enables detailed analysis of how users interact with applications or websites by breaking down events by various properties and segments. Event Segmentation offers robust visualization capabilities, multiple measurement methodologies, and sophisticated analytical features that help transform raw event data into actionable insights.

Key features include multiple measurement types (Uniques, Event Totals, Active %), diverse visualization options (line charts, stacked area charts, bar charts), custom formula creation, in-line custom events, rolling averages and windows, period-over-period comparisons, and real-time segmentation capabilities.

## Product Relationships and Features

### Event Selection and Filtering
Event Segmentation allows users to select specific events for analysis and apply filters based on event properties. The in-line custom event feature enables users to combine multiple events using OR logic, creating temporary event definitions for specific analytical needs without permanently modifying the event taxonomy.

### Measurement Options
The platform offers various ways to measure event data:
- **Uniques**: Counts distinct users who performed an event
- **Event Totals**: Counts the total number of event occurrences
- **Active %**: Shows the percentage of active users who performed an event
- **Average**: Calculates the average number of times users performed an event
- **Frequency**: Displays the distribution of event frequency across users
- **Properties**: Measures based on specific event property values
- **Formula**: Enables custom calculations using events and mathematical operations

### Visualization Types
Event Segmentation provides multiple visualization options:
- Line charts for trend analysis
- Stacked area charts for comparing proportions over time
- Bar charts (vertical and horizontal) for categorical comparisons
- Stacked bar charts for part-to-whole relationships
- Group-by visualizations for multi-dimensional analysis
- Options for displaying absolute totals or relative percentages

### Advanced Analysis Features
The platform includes sophisticated analytical capabilities:
- **Rolling Averages**: Smooths cyclical data using unweighted means
- **Rolling Windows**: Aggregates data over specified time periods
- **Cumulative Sum**: Shows running totals over time
- **Real-time Segmentation**: Analyzes data as it arrives
- **Period-over-period comparison**: Compares current metrics against historical periods

### Custom Formulas
Event Segmentation supports complex formula creation:
- **Metrics formulas**: Basic arithmetic operations between events (A+B, A/B)
- **Aggregation formulas**: Functions like UNIQUES, TOTALS, PROPSUM
- **Function formulas**: Advanced operations like CUMSUM, ROLLAVG

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: A discrete user action or system occurrence tracked in the platform
- **In-line Custom Events**: Temporary combinations of multiple events created within charts
- **Segment**: A defined subset of users based on properties or behaviors
- **Group-by**: A method to split analysis by specific user or event properties
- **Breakdown Table**: Tabular display of numerical data corresponding to chart visualizations
- **Microscope Feature**: Tool for drilling down into specific data points for deeper analysis
- **Rolling Average**: Statistical technique that smooths data by averaging over a moving time window
- **Cumulative Sum (CUMSUM)**: Running total that accumulates values over time
- **Measured As Module**: Component for selecting how event data is calculated and displayed
- **Y-axis Configuration**: Settings to adjust how data is scaled and displayed vertically
- **Dual Y-axis**: Feature allowing two different measurement scales on the same chart

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Event Segmentation is a core analytical component within the broader Amplitude analytics platform. It integrates with other Amplitude features:

1. **Funnel Analysis**: In-line custom events created in Event Segmentation can be utilized in funnel charts
2. **Custom Events**: Temporary in-line events can be saved as permanent custom events for reuse across the platform
3. **Data Tables**: Custom formulas developed in Event Segmentation can be applied in Data Table charts

The product appears to function as a central analysis hub within Amplitude, allowing users to create, visualize, and share insights derived from event data. While the documentation doesn't explicitly mention API endpoints or command-line interfaces, the product is primarily accessed through a web interface with point-and-click functionality and options for advanced customization through formulas and configuration settings.
