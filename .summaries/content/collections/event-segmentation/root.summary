## Amplitude Event Segmentation

Event Segmentation is Amplitude's flagship behavioral analytics product that enables organizations to analyze user interactions and event patterns through sophisticated measurement and visualization capabilities. The product serves as the analytical foundation for understanding how users engage with digital products by examining specific events, user segments, and behavioral metrics across customizable time periods.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

Event Segmentation operates through four interconnected modules that create a comprehensive analytical framework:

The **Events Module** forms the analytical foundation, supporting standard event selection and in-line custom events that combine multiple existing events using OR logic without permanent storage. This module integrates directly with Amplitude's event taxonomy while providing flexibility for ad-hoc analysis.

The **Measured As Module** functions as the analytical engine, offering multiple measurement methodologies including Uniques (distinct user counts), Event Totals (occurrence counts), Active percentages, Frequency distributions, and Property-based measurements (sum, distribution, average, distinct, median). Advanced temporal analysis capabilities include rolling averages, rolling windows, cumulative sums, and period-over-period comparisons through custom formulas supporting 20+ formula types.

The **Segmentation Module** enables granular user segment definition and filtering, allowing analysts to decompose data by user characteristics or behaviors while supporting multiple segmentation properties through group-by conditions and cohort filtering for temporal analysis.

The **Visualization Engine** transforms analytical outputs into multiple chart formats including line charts, stacked area charts, bar charts, pie charts, and KPI grids, with dual Y-axis support and toggling between absolute totals and relative percentages.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Event Segmentation Chart**: Primary visualization interface for analyzing user behavior patterns and event data across segments and time dimensions.

**Uniques vs Event Totals**: Core measurement distinction where Uniques measures distinct users performing events while Event Totals counts all event instances regardless of user repetition.

**In-line Custom Events**: Temporary event combinations using OR logic that exist only within current analysis sessions without permanent taxonomy storage.

**Rolling Windows**: Time-based aggregation methodology that smooths data across specified intervals, supporting up to 36 five-minute intervals, 72 hours, 90 days, 12 weeks, or 12 months.

**Active Percentage**: Metric displaying the percentage of users within a segment who performed specific events during the analysis timeframe.

**Custom Formulas**: Advanced analytical expressions utilizing event letter referencing syntax with support for metrics (UNIQUES, TOTALS, PROPSUM), aggregation functions (ROLLAVG, CUMSUM), and mathematical functions (LOG, POWER, TRENDLINE).

**Cohort Filtering**: Temporal segmentation enabling before/after cohort analysis for understanding behavioral changes over time periods.

**HyperLogLog Algorithm**: Probabilistic algorithm employed for efficient unique user counting in large-scale datasets.

**SEMANTICTOTALS**: Specialized formula handling for array properties in calculations.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Event Segmentation integrates extensively with Amplitude's analytics ecosystem through multiple touchpoints:

**Microscope Integration** provides drill-down capabilities from Event Segmentation visualizations to individual user behavior examination, with limitations for in-line custom events requiring permanent event storage.

**Cross-Chart Formula Consistency** enables shared custom formula capabilities with Data Table Charts and compatible formula structures with User Sessions Charts, creating analytical coherence across visualization types.

**Funnel Charts Integration** supports in-line custom events functionality, maintaining analytical consistency across conversion analysis workflows.

**Real-time Analytics Support** enables live behavioral monitoring with specific time interval constraints for immediate insights.

**Event Taxonomy Integration** connects directly with Amplitude's broader event classification system while supporting temporary analytical constructs.

## Technical Implementation

The product leverages several technical approaches:

**Event Letter Referencing System**: Alphabetical identifier methodology for referencing events in custom formulas, enabling complex analytical expressions.

**Ordinary Least-Squares Regression**: Powers trendline calculations within custom formulas for predictive analytical capabilities.

**Property Grouping Validation**: Ensures analytical integrity when combining multiple segmentation properties in complex analyses.

**Temporal Aggregation Engine**: Supports various time-based calculations including rolling averages, cumulative sums, and period-over-period comparisons.

Event Segmentation represents Amplitude's core behavioral analytics capability, providing essential tools for user engagement analysis, product performance measurement, and data-driven organizational decision-making through flexible, scalable analytical infrastructure.
