# Amplitude Event Segmentation Analytics

Amplitude Event Segmentation is a comprehensive behavioral analytics platform that enables organizations to analyze user interaction patterns through customizable charts and advanced data visualizations. The product serves as a foundational analytics tool for tracking, measuring, and interpreting user behavior by segmenting events based on various properties, user characteristics, and temporal patterns.

## Core Product Architecture

Event Segmentation operates through four interconnected modules that collectively create sophisticated analytics capabilities:

The **Events Module** functions as the data foundation, enabling selection of specific events and their associated properties for analysis. It supports in-line custom event creation using OR logic to combine multiple existing events without requiring permanent storage, while maintaining integration with Amplitude's broader ecosystem through saved custom events functionality.

The **Measured As Module** provides the analytical computation engine with diverse measurement methodologies including Uniques (distinct user counts), Event Totals (raw event occurrences), Active percentages, Frequency analysis with customizable bucketing, and property-based measurements encompassing Sum, Distribution, Average, Distinct counts, and Median calculations. Advanced temporal features include rolling averages, rolling windows, and cumulative sum calculations.

The **Segmentation Module** enables sophisticated user segment definition and filtering capabilities, supporting both static user properties and dynamic behavioral segments through "Group segment by" functionality for multi-dimensional analytical breakdowns.

The **Visualization Engine** transforms processed data into multiple chart formats including line charts with dual Y-axis support, stacked area charts, bar charts, pie charts, and KPI grids, complemented by detailed breakdown tables for granular analysis.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Event Segmentation Chart** represents the primary visualization interface for analyzing user behavior patterns across different segments and temporal dimensions.

**Uniques vs Event Totals** constitutes a fundamental measurement distinction where Uniques quantifies distinct users performing specific events while Event Totals measures raw event occurrence frequency.

**In-line Custom Events** are temporary event combinations utilizing OR logic that exist exclusively within the current chart context, currently available in closed beta testing.

**Rolling Averages** implement unweighted mean smoothing techniques for trend analysis over specified time windows, enabling pattern identification in noisy data.

**Rolling Windows** perform aggregate sum calculations over moving time periods, facilitating identification of cyclical patterns and temporal trends.

**Cumulative Sum (CUMSUM)** generates running totals that accumulate values over time, particularly valuable for revenue tracking, growth analysis, and progressive metric monitoring.

**Property-based Measurements** enable analytics based on event or user property values rather than simple event occurrence counts, supporting complex business logic analysis.

**Group-by Conditions** facilitate multi-dimensional segmentation allowing simultaneous analysis across multiple properties and user characteristics.

**Real-time Segmentation** provides live data analysis capabilities with 5-minute caching intervals for immediate user behavior insights.

## Ecosystem Integration and Platform Relationships

Event Segmentation integrates comprehensively with Amplitude's analytics ecosystem through multiple integration points:

**Data Table Charts** share identical custom formula syntax and measurement capabilities, ensuring consistent analytical approaches across visualization types. **Funnel Charts** support in-line custom events with equivalent OR logic functionality, enabling seamless transition between conversion analysis and behavioral segmentation. **User Sessions Charts** maintain compatibility with custom formula applications, allowing session-based analysis using Event Segmentation's computational framework.

The **Microscope Feature** provides drill-down capabilities for detailed user journey analysis, enabling transition from aggregate insights to individual user behavior examination. The **Custom Events System** allows conversion of temporary in-line events to permanently saved custom events, supporting reusable analytical components across the platform.

**HyperLogLog Algorithm** serves as the underlying technology for efficient unique user calculations at scale, enabling accurate distinct count computations across large datasets without performance degradation.

## Technical Implementation and API Framework

**Custom Formulas Syntax** supports over 20 formula types with structured syntax requirements using alphabetical event references (A, B, C, etc.) for complex analytical calculations:

- **Metrics formulas**: `UNIQUES(A)`, `TOTALS(A)`, `PROPSUM(A)` for basic measurement operations
- **Aggregation formulas**: `ROLLAVG(A,7)`, `CUMSUM(A)`, `ROLLWIN(A,30)` for temporal analysis
- **Function formulas**: `LOG(A)`, `POWER(A,2)`, `TRENDLINE(A)` for mathematical transformations

**Real-time Processing Architecture** supports live data analysis with 5-minute cache refresh intervals, integrating with Amplitude's broader data ingestion pipeline for immediate insight generation.

**Interactive Chart Controls** include period-over-period comparison capabilities, absolute versus relative percentage switching for stacked visualizations, and custom Y-axis configuration including dual Y-axis support for line charts enabling simultaneous visualization of metrics with different scales.

Event Segmentation functions as the central analytics hub within Amplitude's ecosystem, providing foundational event analysis capabilities that feed into specialized tools including cohort analysis, retention tracking, conversion funnel optimization, and advanced user journey mapping, establishing it as the primary entry point for behavioral analytics workflows.
