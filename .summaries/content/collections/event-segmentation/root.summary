# Event Segmentation in Amplitude

Event Segmentation is a core analytics feature in Amplitude that enables product teams to analyze and visualize user behavior data by tracking specific events and their properties over time. This foundational analysis tool helps teams understand how users interact with their products and identify meaningful patterns in user behavior.

## Product Overview and Key Features

Event Segmentation allows users to:
- Track and analyze specific user actions (events) within products
- Break down user behavior by different properties and segments
- Analyze data using various measurement metrics (uniques, totals, averages)
- Visualize data through customizable chart types
- Apply advanced analysis techniques like rolling averages and period-over-period comparisons
- Create complex calculations using custom formulas
- Combine multiple events directly within charts using in-line custom events

## Product Relationships and Architecture

Event Segmentation serves as a foundational component in Amplitude's analytics ecosystem. It provides the basic building blocks for understanding user behavior that feed into more complex analyses. The workflow follows a structured approach:

1. Event selection → 2. Property application → 3. Measurement type selection → 4. User segmentation → 5. Visualization customization

The insights generated from Event Segmentation can inform product decisions, feature prioritization, and user experience improvements across the broader product ecosystem.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events**: Specific user actions tracked within a product (e.g., button clicks, page views)

**Measurement Types**:
- **Uniques**: Count of unique users who performed an event (default)
- **Event Totals**: Total number of times an event occurred
- **Active %**: Percentage of users who performed an event out of total active users
- **Average**: Average number of times users performed an event
- **Frequency**: Distribution of users based on event performance frequency
- **Properties**: Analysis of numeric property values (sum, average, min, max, percentiles)
- **Formula**: Custom calculations using mathematical operations

**Custom Formulas**:
- **Metrics Formulas**: Basic mathematical operations on events (A+B, A-B, A/B)
- **Aggregation Formulas**: Functions like CUMSUM and ROLLAVG
- **Function Formulas**: Special functions for specific calculations

**In-line Custom Events**: Beta feature allowing temporary combination of multiple events using OR logic directly within charts

**Visualization Types**:
- **Line Charts**: Track trends over time
- **Stacked Area Charts**: Show proportional contribution of segments
- **Bar Charts**: Compare discrete categories
- **Stacked Bar Charts**: Compare segments within categories
- **Group-by Visualizations**: Analyze relationships between multiple properties

**Analysis Features**:
- **Rolling Averages**: Smooth cyclical data using unweighted means
- **Rolling Windows**: Aggregate data over specific time periods (7-day, 28-day)
- **Cumulative Sum**: Display running totals over time
- **Real-time Segmentation**: View data as it arrives
- **Period-over-period Comparison**: Compare current data with previous periods

**Y-axis Customization**:
- **Dual Y-axes**: Display two metrics on separate scales
- **Custom Ranges**: Set specific minimum/maximum values
- **Unit Display Formats**: Show values as percentages, currency, etc.

## Integration in Amplitude Ecosystem

Event Segmentation integrates with other Amplitude features to provide comprehensive analytics capabilities. The data and insights from Event Segmentation can be used in:
- Funnel analysis
- Retention analysis
- Cohort analysis
- User journey mapping
- Feature impact assessment

The tool provides the fundamental metrics and visualizations that serve as building blocks for more sophisticated analyses within the Amplitude platform.
