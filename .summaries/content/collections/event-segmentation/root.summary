# Event Segmentation in Amplitude

Event Segmentation is a core analytics capability in Amplitude that enables users to analyze and visualize user behavior data by tracking events and their properties over time. This powerful feature helps product teams understand user interactions, identify patterns, and make data-driven decisions.

## Product Overview and Key Features

Event Segmentation allows users to:
- Track and analyze specific user actions (events) within products
- Break down user behavior by various properties and segments
- Analyze data using multiple measurement types (uniques, totals, averages, etc.)
- Visualize data through customizable chart types (line, bar, stacked area)
- Apply advanced analysis tools like rolling averages and cumulative sums
- Create complex calculations using custom formulas
- Combine multiple events on-the-fly with in-line event creation

## Product Relationships and Architecture

Event Segmentation serves as a foundational analysis tool within Amplitude's analytics platform. It provides the data visualization capabilities that support other Amplitude features:

1. **Core Analysis Tool**: Event Segmentation is the primary method for visualizing and analyzing event data
2. **Supports Advanced Features**: Provides underlying data analysis for other Amplitude tools like Funnels, Retention, and Pathfinder
3. **Dashboard Integration**: Analyses can be saved to dashboards for ongoing monitoring
4. **Collaboration Features**: Insights can be shared with team members
5. **Cohort Creation**: Results can be used to create user cohorts for further analysis
6. **Export Capabilities**: Data can be exported for use in other tools

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Events**: Specific user actions tracked in your product (e.g., "Button Click", "Purchase Completed")
- **Properties**: Attributes associated with events or users that provide context
- **Segments**: Groups of users based on behavior or characteristics
- **Measurement Types**:
  - **Uniques**: Count of unique users who performed an event
  - **Event Totals**: Total number of times an event occurred
  - **Active %**: Percentage of users who performed an event out of total active users
  - **Average**: Average number of times users performed an event
  - **Frequency**: Distribution of users based on event frequency
  - **Properties**: Measurements based on event property values (sum, average, min, max, percentiles)
- **Custom Formulas**: Mathematical expressions combining events and metrics
  - **CUMSUM()**: Cumulative sum function for running totals
  - **ROLLAVG()**: Rolling average function for data smoothing
  - **UNIQUES()**: Function to count unique users
  - **PROPSUM()**: Function to sum property values
- **In-line Custom Events**: Temporary combinations of multiple events using OR logic
- **Breakdown Table**: Detailed metrics for each segment in the analysis
- **Group-by**: Additional dimension for segmenting data

## Chart Building Process

The Event Segmentation chart building workflow follows these steps:

1. **Select Events**: Choose specific user actions to analyze
2. **Apply Properties**: Filter events based on their properties
3. **Choose Measurement Type**: Select how to quantify the events
4. **Segment Users**: Break down analysis by user segments or properties
5. **Customize Visualization**: Select chart type and adjust display options

## Visualization Options

Event Segmentation offers multiple visualization types:
- **Line Charts**: Track trends over time
- **Stacked Area Charts**: Show composition of total values
- **Bar Charts**: Compare discrete values
- **Stacked Bar Charts**: Compare composition across categories
- **Group-by Visualizations**: Add additional dimensions to analysis

## Advanced Analysis Capabilities

- **Rolling Averages**: Smooth data by averaging values over specified periods
- **Rolling Windows**: Aggregate data over custom time windows (days, weeks, months)
- **Cumulative Sum**: Display running totals over time
- **Real-time Segmentation**: View data as it comes in with minimal delay
- **Period-over-period Comparison**: Compare current data with previous time periods
- **Custom Formula Syntax**: Example: `UNIQUES(A) / UNIQUES(B) * 100` to calculate conversion rate percentage

Event Segmentation provides the analytical foundation for understanding user behavior in Amplitude, enabling teams to identify trends, measure impact, and optimize their products based on actual usage data.
