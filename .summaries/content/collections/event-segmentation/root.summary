# Amplitude Event Segmentation

## Product Overview

Event Segmentation is a core analytics feature within Amplitude that enables users to analyze user behavior by tracking and visualizing events across different segments. The tool provides deep insights into how users interact with products by breaking down event data across various dimensions, time periods, and measurement types.

Key features include:
- Customized event analysis charts
- Multiple measurement options (Uniques, Totals, Active %, etc.)
- Custom formula creation for complex analyses
- In-line event combination
- Advanced visualization options
- Real-time data analysis
- Period-over-period comparisons

Event Segmentation serves as a fundamental analysis tool for product teams, marketers, and analysts to understand user behavior patterns, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions.

## Product Relationships and Features

Event Segmentation's functionality is organized around a structured chart building process:

1. **Chart Building Process**:
   - Event selection and filtering
   - Property application
   - Measurement type selection
   - User segmentation
   - Y-axis customization

2. **Measurement Options**:
   - Uniques: Counts distinct users who performed an event
   - Event Totals: Counts total occurrences of an event
   - Active %: Shows percentage of users who performed an event
   - Average: Calculates average value of a property
   - Frequency: Groups users by how often they perform an event
   - Properties: Analyzes specific property values
   - Formula: Creates custom calculations

3. **Visualization Types**:
   - Line charts
   - Stacked area charts
   - Bar charts
   - Stacked bar charts
   - Group-by visualizations

4. **Advanced Analysis Features**:
   - Rolling Averages: Smooths data over time periods
   - Rolling Windows: Aggregates data over specified windows
   - Cumulative Sum: Shows running totals
   - Real-time Segmentation: Analyzes data as it arrives
   - Period-over-period comparison: Compares current data to historical periods

5. **Custom Formulas**:
   - Metrics formulas: Basic event measurements
   - Aggregation formulas: Data aggregation over time
   - Function formulas: Complex mathematical operations

6. **In-line Custom Events**:
   - Combines multiple events with OR logic
   - Applies within charts without creating permanent custom events
   - Can be saved for reuse

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: A specific user action tracked in Amplitude (e.g., button click, page view)
- **Event Property**: Additional attributes of an event (e.g., price, category)
- **Segment**: A specific subset of users based on properties or behaviors
- **Uniques**: Count of distinct users who performed an event
- **Event Totals**: Total count of event occurrences
- **Active %**: Percentage of users who performed an event
- **Breakdown Table**: Displays numerical data for each segment in the chart
- **Group-by**: Method to create multiple segments based on property values
- **CUMSUM**: Cumulative sum function for running totals
- **ROLLAVG**: Rolling average function for data smoothing
- **ROLLWIN**: Rolling window function for data aggregation
- **Microscope**: Feature to drill down into specific data points
- **In-line Custom Events**: Temporary event combinations created within a chart

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Event Segmentation functions as a foundational analysis tool within the broader Amplitude analytics platform, integrating with:

1. **Funnel Analysis**: In-line custom events can be used in funnel charts to analyze conversion paths
2. **Custom Events**: In-line events can be saved as permanent custom events for reuse
3. **Data Tables**: Custom formulas work in both Event Segmentation and Data Table charts
4. **Cohort Analysis**: Event Segmentation allows for cohort comparison

The product serves as a primary tool for exploring user behavior data before potentially using other specialized Amplitude analysis features for deeper investigation.

## Technical Implementation

The documentation reveals several technical implementation details:

1. **Formula Syntax**: 
   - Letters (A-Z) reference events
   - Mathematical operators (+, -, *, /, ^) for calculations
   - Functions like UNIQUES(), TOTALS(), PROPSUM()
   - Example: `(A - B) / A * 100` to calculate percentage difference

2. **Measurement Functions**:
   - CUMSUM(X): Calculates running total of X
   - ROLLAVG(X, n): Calculates n-day rolling average of X
   - ROLLWIN(X, n): Aggregates data over n-day windows

3. **Chart Configuration Options**:
   - Y-axis customization with min/max ranges
   - Dual Y-axis setup for comparing different measurement scales
   - Unit display formats (%, $, etc.)

Event Segmentation is primarily accessed through Amplitude's web interface rather than through direct API calls, though the underlying data and calculations likely have API equivalents within the broader Amplitude platform.
