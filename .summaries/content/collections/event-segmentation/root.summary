# Amplitude Event Segmentation Analytics

Amplitude Event Segmentation is a comprehensive behavioral analytics platform that enables deep analysis of user interactions through customizable charts and visualizations. The product serves as a core component of user behavior analysis, measuring events, segmenting users, and applying statistical functions to identify patterns and trends in application usage.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

Event Segmentation operates through four interconnected core modules that collaborate to generate analytical insights:

The **Events Module** forms the analytical foundation, enabling selection of specific events with property-based filtering capabilities. It supports in-line custom event creation using OR logic to combine multiple existing events without permanent storage, alongside "Any Event" selection functionality that integrates with Amplitude's broader event taxonomy.

The **Measured As Module** provides the analytical engine with diverse measurement methodologies including Uniques (distinct user counts), Event Totals (raw occurrence counts), Active percentage calculations, Frequency analysis with customizable buckets, and property-based measurements (Sum, Distribution, Average, Distinct, Median). Advanced capabilities include rolling averages, rolling windows, cumulative sums, and real-time segmentation processing.

The **Segmentation Module** facilitates user cohort analysis through segments defined by user properties, behaviors, or custom criteria. It supports simultaneous multi-property segmentation with before/after cohort filtering capabilities for temporal analysis.

The **Visualization Engine** transforms analytical outputs into multiple chart formats including line charts with dual Y-axis support, stacked area charts, horizontal and vertical bar charts, pie charts, and KPI grids, with toggleable absolute/relative percentage views.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Event Segmentation Chart**: Primary visualization interface for analyzing event data across user segments and temporal dimensions.

**Uniques vs Event Totals**: Core measurement distinction where Uniques represents distinct users performing events while Event Totals counts raw event occurrences.

**In-line Custom Events**: Temporary event combinations using OR logic existing only within current chart context, with conversion capability to permanent custom events.

**Rolling Windows**: Time-based aggregation functions smoothing data over specified intervals (5-minute, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly) with defined limits: 36 five-minute intervals, 72 hours, 90 days, 12 weeks, 12 months.

**Active Percentage**: Calculated metric displaying percentage of users within segments who performed specific events.

**Property-based Measurements**: Analytics applied to event or user properties including PROPSUM, distribution analysis, and statistical functions.

**Period-over-Period Comparison**: Temporal analysis enabling current data comparison against historical periods using offset date pickers.

**SEMANTICTOTALS**: Specialized calculation method for array property analysis.

**HyperLogLog**: Algorithm employed for efficient unique user calculations at scale.

## Custom Formulas and Advanced Analytics

The platform supports 20+ custom formula types organized into three functional categories:

**Metrics Formulas**: UNIQUES, TOTALS, PROPSUM for fundamental event and property calculations
**Aggregation Formulas**: ROLLAVG, CUMSUM, PERCENTILE for time-series analysis
**Function Formulas**: LOG, POWER, TRENDLINE using ordinary least-squares regression

Formulas utilize event letter referencing (A, B, C) and support complex calculations including ARPAU (Average Revenue Per Active User). The system implements HyperLogLog algorithms for scalable unique user computations and provides SEMANTICTOTALS functionality for array property analysis.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Event Segmentation integrates comprehensively with Amplitude's analytics ecosystem, sharing event data with Funnel Charts and connecting to Microscope for granular user journey analysis. The tool supports User Sessions chart formulas while maintaining consistency with Amplitude's event taxonomy and user property systems.

Charts support cross-visualization conversion and real-time data analysis with configurable refresh intervals. Segmentation data feeds into additional Amplitude products for cohort analysis and behavioral tracking workflows.

## Technical Implementation and Data Processing

The system processes data through configurable time intervals supporting both real-time and historical analysis modes. Rolling window calculations maintain data integrity via deduplication algorithms, particularly for unique user counts across overlapping temporal periods. The platform manages large-scale data aggregation while preserving query performance through optimized data structures and caching mechanisms.

Breakdown tables provide granular data exploration, enabling drill-down from high-level visualizations into detailed event and user data. Dual Y-axis functionality facilitates comparison of metrics with different scales within unified visualizations.

The architecture supports period-over-period analysis, custom formula computation, and real-time segmentation processing while maintaining integration touchpoints with Amplitude's broader behavioral analytics suite.
