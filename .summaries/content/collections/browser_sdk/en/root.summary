## Amplitude Browser SDK Product Suite

The Amplitude Browser SDK is a comprehensive analytics platform for web applications, providing event tracking, user analytics, and marketing attribution capabilities. The product suite consists of multiple SDK versions and specialized tools designed to capture, process, and analyze user behavior data in browser environments.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

### Core SDK Evolution
The product suite follows a clear evolutionary path with three main SDK generations:

**Legacy JavaScript SDK (amplitude-js)** - The original maintenance-mode SDK that established core analytics patterns including the `amplitude.getInstance()` API, `logEvent()` methods, and AMP_ cookie conventions.

**Browser SDK 1.x (@amplitude/analytics-browser v1)** - A TypeScript-first rewrite introducing the HTTP V2 API, plugin architecture, and modern promise-based APIs while maintaining backward compatibility patterns.

**Browser SDK 2.x (@amplitude/analytics-browser v2)** - The current flagship SDK featuring built-in autocapture functionality, consolidated marketing attribution, simplified configuration, and enhanced plugin capabilities.

### Specialized SDK Variants
**Marketing Analytics SDK (@amplitude/marketing-analytics-browser)** - An extension of Browser SDK 1.x specifically designed for marketing attribution tracking, including UTM parameters, referrer data, click IDs, and multi-touch attribution models.

**Browser Unified SDK (@amplitude/unified)** - A beta integration layer providing unified access to Analytics, Experiment, and Session Replay products through a single initialization point using `initAll()`.

### Code Generation Tools
**Ampli Wrappers** - Strongly-typed code generation tools that create JavaScript/TypeScript APIs from Amplitude Data tracking plans, available for JavaScript SDK, Browser SDK 1.0, and Browser SDK 2.0 with consistent CLI commands (`ampli pull`, `ampli status`) and core methods (`ampli.load()`, `ampli.identify()`, `ampli.track()`, `ampli.flush()`).

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Core Analytics Concepts
- **deviceId**: Persistent browser identifier stored in cookies/localStorage
- **sessionId**: Time-bounded user session identifier with configurable timeout
- **userId**: Application-specific user identifier for cross-device tracking
- **API Key**: Project identifier for routing events to correct Amplitude project
- **HTTP V2 API**: Modern event ingestion endpoint used by Browser SDK 1.x/2.x

### Event Tracking Terminology
- **track()**: Primary event logging method in modern SDKs
- **identify()**: User property management using Identify interface
- **revenue()**: Specialized revenue event tracking with Revenue interface
- **flush()**: Force immediate event transmission to Amplitude servers
- **Autocapture**: Automatic tracking of page views, sessions, form interactions, file downloads, and element interactions

### Cookie and Storage Conventions
- **AMP_ prefix**: Cookie naming pattern combining "AMP_" + API key
- **AMP_MKTG_ prefix**: Marketing attribution cookie naming for UTM/referrer data
- **identityStorage**: Configuration option for storage backend (cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage, none)
- **cookieOptions**: Configuration object for cookie expiration, domain, secure, sameSite settings

### Plugin Architecture
- **EnrichmentPlugin**: Plugins that modify event data before transmission
- **DestinationPlugin**: Plugins that handle event transmission to endpoints
- **Plugin Interface**: Standardized plugin structure with setup(), execute(), and teardown() methods

### Marketing Attribution Terms
- **UTM Parameters**: Campaign tracking parameters (utm_source, utm_medium, utm_campaign, etc.)
- **Click IDs**: Platform-specific tracking identifiers (gclid, fbclid, dclid, ttclid, etc.)
- **First-touch Attribution**: Credit assignment to initial campaign touchpoint
- **Multi-touch Attribution**: Credit distribution across multiple campaign touchpoints
- **Web Attribution V1/V2**: Different versions of marketing attribution tracking logic

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

### Amplitude Data Platform Integration
The Browser SDKs integrate with Amplitude's broader data platform through standardized event schemas and tracking plans. Ampli code generation tools bridge the gap between Amplitude Data's schema management and client-side implementation, ensuring type safety and schema compliance.

### Cross-Product Compatibility
The Browser Unified SDK demonstrates Amplitude's move toward integrated product experiences, combining Analytics event tracking with Experiment feature flagging and Session Replay user experience monitoring under unified configuration and initialization patterns.

### Migration and Compatibility Strategy
The product suite maintains clear migration paths between SDK versions, with comprehensive documentation covering API mapping, configuration changes, and breaking changes. The maintenance mode designation for older SDKs provides stability while encouraging adoption of newer versions.

## API Endpoints and CLI Commands

### CLI Commands (Ampli)
- `ampli pull`: Download latest tracking plan and generate strongly-typed code
- `ampli status`: Verify implementation compliance with tracking plan schema

### Core SDK Methods
- `amplitude.init(apiKey, config)`: SDK initialization with configuration
- `amplitude.track(eventType, eventProperties)`: Event logging
- `amplitude.identify(identify)`: User property management
- `amplitude.revenue(revenue)`: Revenue event tracking
- `amplitude.flush()`: Force event transmission
- `amplitude.reset()`: Clear user data and reset state

### Configuration Endpoints
- **serverZone**: 'US' or 'EU' for data residency compliance
- **serverUrl**: Custom endpoint override for event transmission
- **flushIntervalMillis**: Automatic batch transmission interval
- **flushQueueSize**: Event count threshold for automatic transmission

### Plugin Integration Points
- `amplitude.add(plugin)`: Register enrichment or destination plugins
- `client.instance`: Access underlying AmplitudeClient for advanced plugin development

The Browser SDK product suite represents a mature, feature-rich analytics platform with clear evolutionary paths, comprehensive migration support, and deep integration with Amplitude's broader data and experimentation ecosystem.
