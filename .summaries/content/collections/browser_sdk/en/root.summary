## Amplitude Browser SDK Product Suite

Amplitude's Browser SDK is a comprehensive analytics tracking solution for web applications that enables developers to capture user interactions, events, and behavioral data. The product suite consists of multiple SDK versions and specialized tools designed for different use cases and migration paths.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Browser SDK ecosystem follows an evolutionary architecture with three main SDK generations:

**Legacy Foundation**: The original `amplitude-js` JavaScript SDK serves as the foundational analytics solution, now in maintenance mode with migration paths to newer versions.

**Generation 1**: Browser SDK 1.0 (`@amplitude/analytics-browser` v1) introduced modern TypeScript support, HTTP V2 API integration, and plugin architecture while maintaining backward compatibility.

**Generation 2**: Browser SDK 2.0 (`@amplitude/analytics-browser` v2+) represents the current flagship offering with enhanced autocapture capabilities, consolidated attribution tracking, and streamlined configuration.

**Specialized Extensions**: The Marketing Analytics Browser SDK (`@amplitude/marketing-analytics-browser`) extends Browser SDK functionality with advanced marketing attribution features, though it's now in maintenance mode with features consolidated into Browser SDK 2.0.

**Code Generation Layer**: The Ampli Wrapper system generates strongly-typed TypeScript/JavaScript APIs from Amplitude Data tracking plans, available for all SDK versions (JavaScript SDK, Browser SDK 1.0, and Browser SDK 2.0).

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Tracking Concepts**:
- **deviceId**: Unique identifier for user devices, managed through cookies with `AMP_` prefix
- **userId**: Application-specific user identifier for authenticated users
- **sessionId**: Temporary identifier for user sessions with configurable timeout
- **Event Properties**: Custom data attached to tracked events
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes associated with users via Identify interface

**SDK Architecture**:
- **Plugins**: Extensible architecture supporting enrichment and destination plugins
- **Autocapture**: Automated tracking of user interactions without manual instrumentation
- **HTTP V2 API**: Modern Amplitude ingestion endpoint used by Browser SDK versions
- **CJS Module**: CommonJS module packaging for Node.js compatibility

**Attribution and Marketing**:
- **UTM Parameters**: Campaign tracking parameters (utm_source, utm_medium, utm_campaign, etc.)
- **Click ID Parameters**: Platform-specific identifiers (gclid, fbclid, dclid) for attribution
- **Cross-domain Tracking**: Device identification across multiple domains
- **Web Attribution**: Automated capture of marketing attribution data

**Configuration and Storage**:
- **identityStorage**: Configuration for cookie and localStorage management
- **serverZone**: Data residency options (US, EU)
- **trackingOptions**: Granular control over data collection fields
- **flushQueueSize/flushIntervalMillis**: Event batching and transmission settings

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Browser SDK integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics platform through several key touchpoints:

**Amplitude Data Platform**: The Ampli Wrapper connects directly to Amplitude Data tracking plans, generating type-safe APIs that enforce event schemas and provide autocompletion for consistent data collection.

**Session Replay**: Browser SDK 2.0 provides compatibility with Amplitude's Session Replay product for comprehensive user experience analysis.

**Server-side Processing**: Modern SDK versions leverage server-side enrichment for user agent parsing and data enhancement, reducing client-side processing overhead.

**Multi-platform Analytics**: The Browser SDK shares common patterns and APIs with Amplitude's mobile and server-side SDKs, enabling consistent analytics implementation across platforms.

## API Endpoints and CLI Commands

**Core SDK Methods**:
- `amplitude.init(apiKey, options)`: Initialize SDK with configuration
- `amplitude.track(eventType, eventProperties)`: Log custom events
- `amplitude.identify(identifyObject)`: Set user properties
- `amplitude.setGroup(groupType, groupValue)`: Assign users to groups
- `amplitude.flush()`: Force immediate event transmission

**Ampli CLI Commands**:
- `ampli pull`: Download and generate tracking code from Amplitude Data
- `ampli status`: Verify implementation against tracking plan schema

**Revenue Tracking**:
- `amplitude.revenue.track(revenueObject)`: Track monetary transactions with Revenue interface

**Installation Methods**:
- **npm/yarn**: `npm install @amplitude/analytics-browser` or `yarn add @amplitude/analytics-browser`
- **Script Loader**: Direct browser integration via CDN
- **Package Management**: Support for both npm and yarn package managers

**Transport and Configuration**:
- **sendBeacon**: Reliable event transmission using browser Beacon API
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Compatible with strict security policies
- **Offline Mode**: Queue events when network connectivity is unavailable
- **Remote Configuration**: Dynamic SDK configuration from Amplitude servers

The Browser SDK product suite provides a comprehensive, evolutionarily-designed analytics solution that balances backward compatibility with modern web development practices, offering multiple integration paths and specialized features for different organizational needs and technical requirements.
