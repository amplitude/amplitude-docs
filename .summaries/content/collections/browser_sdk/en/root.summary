# Amplitude Browser SDK Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude's Browser SDK is a JavaScript/TypeScript library designed for tracking user events and analytics in web applications. The product has evolved through several versions, with Browser SDK 2.0 being the current recommended version, while older versions (Browser SDK 1.0 and JavaScript SDK) are in maintenance mode.

The Browser SDK enables developers to:
- Track user events and interactions
- Identify users and manage user properties
- Track revenue events
- Capture marketing attribution data
- Manage sessions
- Implement cross-domain tracking
- Configure event batching and offline support

The SDK supports both manual event tracking through explicit API calls and automatic event capture (Autocapture) for common user interactions like clicks and form submissions.

## Product Relationships and Features

### SDK Versions and Evolution

1. **JavaScript SDK (Legacy)**: The original SDK, now in maintenance mode.
2. **Browser SDK 1.0**: An improved version with TypeScript support and plugin architecture, now in maintenance mode.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Browser SDK integrates with the broader Amplitude ecosystem:

1. **Amplitude Analytics**: The Browser SDK sends event data to Amplitude Analytics for processing and visualization.

2. **Amplitude Data**: The Ampli Wrapper connects with Amplitude Data tracking plans to enforce event schemas.

3. **Cross-Platform Tracking**: Works alongside other Amplitude SDKs (Mobile, Server) to provide a complete view of the user journey across platforms.

4. **Plugin Ecosystem**: Supports extensions through plugins for additional functionality.
