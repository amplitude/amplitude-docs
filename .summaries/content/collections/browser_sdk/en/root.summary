## Amplitude Browser SDK Product Ecosystem

The Amplitude Browser SDK is a comprehensive analytics tracking solution for web applications, offering multiple SDK versions and specialized tools for event tracking, user analytics, and marketing attribution. The ecosystem centers around strongly-typed JavaScript/TypeScript SDKs that integrate with Amplitude's HTTP V2 API for robust web analytics.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

### Core SDK Evolution
The product ecosystem follows a clear evolutionary path with three main SDK generations:

**Legacy JavaScript SDK (amplitude-js)** - The original maintenance-mode SDK providing basic event tracking, user identification, and analytics capabilities through the `amplitude.getInstance()` pattern.

**Browser SDK 1.0 (@amplitude/analytics-browser v1)** - A modernized TypeScript/JavaScript SDK that introduced the HTTP V2 API, plugin architecture, and eliminated the getInstance() pattern in favor of direct method calls.

**Browser SDK 2.0 (@amplitude/analytics-browser v2+)** - The current flagship SDK featuring built-in autocapture functionality, enhanced marketing attribution, consolidated configuration options, and server-side user agent parsing.

### Specialized Extensions and Tools

**Ampli Wrappers** - Code generation tools that create strongly-typed tracking APIs from Amplitude Data tracking plans, available for all SDK versions (JavaScript SDK, Browser SDK 1.0, and Browser SDK 2.0). These generate CJS modules with methods like `ampli.load()`, `ampli.identify()`, `ampli.track()`, and `ampli.flush()`.

**Marketing Analytics SDK (@amplitude/marketing-analytics-browser)** - A maintenance-mode extension providing automatic UTM parameter tracking, referrer attribution, click ID capture, and page view tracking with campaign-based session management.

**Browser Unified SDK (@amplitude/unified)** - A beta integration package that provides unified initialization for Analytics, Experiment, and Session Replay through a single `initAll()` method.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Core Tracking Concepts
- **deviceId**: Persistent browser identifier stored in cookies with AMP_ prefix
- **sessionId**: Temporary session identifier for grouping user interactions
- **userId**: Custom user identifier for cross-device tracking
- **Autocapture**: Automatic tracking of page views, sessions, form interactions, file downloads, and element interactions
- **Attribution**: Marketing campaign tracking including UTM parameters, referrers, and click IDs (gclid, fbclid, dclid)

### Configuration and Storage
- **identityStorage**: Storage mechanism options (cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage, none)
- **cookieOptions**: Cookie configuration including expiration, secure flags, and sameSite settings
- **AMP_{api_key}**: Cookie naming convention using API key suffix
- **serverZone**: Data residency configuration for EU compliance
- **trackingOptions**: Granular control over what data gets tracked

### Plugin Architecture
- **EnrichmentPlugin**: Plugins that modify event data before sending
- **DestinationPlugin**: Plugins that handle event delivery
- **Plugin Interface**: Extensible system for custom functionality

### Event Management
- **flushQueueSize**: Number of events to batch before sending
- **flushIntervalMillis**: Time interval for automatic event sending
- **sendBeacon**: Browser API for reliable event delivery during page unload
- **defaultTracking**: Configuration object for built-in tracking features

## Integration Patterns and API Methods

### Core SDK Methods
All modern SDKs share common method patterns:
- `track()`: Event tracking with properties
- `identify()`: User property management
- `setUserId()`: User identification
- `setDeviceId()`: Device identification
- `flush()`: Force event queue processing
- `reset()`: Clear user data and reset state

### CLI Integration
Ampli wrappers integrate with the Amplitude CLI:
- `ampli pull`: Download tracking plan and generate code
- `ampli status`: Verify implementation against tracking plan

### Installation Methods
SDKs support multiple installation approaches:
- Script loader for direct browser integration
- npm/yarn package management
- RequireJS module loading
- Google Tag Manager integration

## Consent Management and Privacy

The ecosystem provides comprehensive privacy controls including GDPR and CNIL compliance through deferred initialization patterns, opt-out mechanisms, and configurable cookie policies. The `deferInitialization` and `enableTracking()` methods enable consent management platform integration.

## Migration and Maintenance Strategy

The documentation reveals a clear migration path from legacy systems to modern implementations, with detailed migration guides for each transition. The Marketing Analytics SDK and Browser SDK 1.0 are in maintenance mode, with Browser SDK 2.0 representing the current development focus. The ecosystem maintains backward compatibility while encouraging adoption of newer, more feature-rich versions.
