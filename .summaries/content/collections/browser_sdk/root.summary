# Amplitude Browser SDK Product Suite

The Amplitude Browser SDK is a comprehensive web analytics platform that enables developers to track user behavior, measure marketing attribution, and analyze engagement across web applications. The product suite encompasses multiple SDK generations, specialized tracking tools, and code generation utilities designed to capture, process, and transmit user interaction data to Amplitude's analytics platform.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

### Core SDK Evolution
The product suite follows a clear evolutionary progression across three main SDK generations:

**Legacy JavaScript SDK (amplitude-js)** serves as the foundational analytics implementation, now in maintenance mode. It established core patterns including the `amplitude.getInstance()` API, `logEvent()` methods, and AMP_ cookie naming conventions that persist across newer versions.

**Browser SDK 1.x (@amplitude/analytics-browser v1)** represents a complete TypeScript rewrite introducing the HTTP V2 API, plugin architecture, and modern promise-based APIs. This version maintains backward compatibility while modernizing the underlying implementation.

**Browser SDK 2.x (@amplitude/analytics-browser v2)** is the current flagship offering, featuring built-in autocapture functionality for automatic event tracking, consolidated marketing attribution, simplified configuration patterns, and enhanced plugin capabilities.

### Specialized SDK Variants
**Marketing Analytics SDK (@amplitude/marketing-analytics-browser)** extends Browser SDK 1.x specifically for marketing attribution use cases. It provides specialized tracking for UTM parameters, referrer data, click IDs (gclid, fbclid, dclid, ttclid), and supports both first-touch and multi-touch attribution models.

**Browser Unified SDK (@amplitude/unified)** offers a beta integration layer that consolidates Analytics, Experiment, and Session Replay products through a single initialization point using `initAll()`, representing Amplitude's unified product strategy.

### Code Generation Tools
**Ampli Wrappers** provide strongly-typed code generation from Amplitude Data tracking plans, creating JavaScript/TypeScript APIs that ensure schema compliance. Available for all major SDK versions, they maintain consistent CLI patterns and core method signatures across implementations.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Core Analytics Concepts
- **deviceId**: Persistent browser identifier stored in cookies or localStorage for anonymous user tracking
- **sessionId**: Time-bounded user session identifier with configurable timeout periods
- **userId**: Application-specific user identifier enabling cross-device user journey tracking
- **API Key**: Project-specific identifier routing events to the correct Amplitude project
- **HTTP V2 API**: Modern event ingestion endpoint utilized by Browser SDK 1.x and 2.x

### Event Tracking Terminology
- **track()**: Primary event logging method in modern SDK implementations
- **identify()**: User property management using the Identify interface for user attribute updates
- **revenue()**: Specialized revenue event tracking utilizing the Revenue interface
- **flush()**: Force immediate transmission of queued events to Amplitude servers
- **Autocapture**: Automatic tracking of page views, sessions, form interactions, file downloads, and element interactions without manual instrumentation

### Storage and Cookie Conventions
- **AMP_ prefix**: Cookie naming pattern combining "AMP_" with the API key for event data storage
- **AMP_MKTG_ prefix**: Marketing attribution cookie naming for UTM parameters and referrer data
- **identityStorage**: Configuration option specifying storage backend (cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage, none)
- **cookieOptions**: Configuration object controlling cookie expiration, domain, secure, and sameSite attributes

### Plugin Architecture
- **EnrichmentPlugin**: Plugins that modify or enhance event data before transmission
- **DestinationPlugin**: Plugins handling event transmission to various endpoints
- **Plugin Interface**: Standardized plugin structure requiring setup(), execute(), and teardown() methods

### Marketing Attribution Terms
- **UTM Parameters**: Campaign tracking parameters including utm_source, utm_medium, utm_campaign, utm_content, and utm_term
- **Click IDs**: Platform-specific tracking identifiers from advertising networks
- **First-touch Attribution**: Credit assignment methodology attributing conversion to the initial campaign touchpoint
- **Multi-touch Attribution**: Credit distribution methodology spreading conversion value across multiple campaign touchpoints
- **Web Attribution V1/V2**: Different versions of marketing attribution tracking logic with varying feature sets

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

### Amplitude Data Platform Integration
The Browser SDKs integrate deeply with Amplitude's data platform through standardized event schemas and tracking plans. Ampli code generation tools create a bridge between Amplitude Data's schema management capabilities and client-side implementation, ensuring type safety and maintaining schema compliance across development teams.

### Cross-Product Compatibility
The Browser Unified SDK demonstrates Amplitude's strategic move toward integrated product experiences, combining Analytics event tracking with Experiment feature flagging and Session Replay user experience monitoring. This unified approach provides consistent configuration patterns and shared initialization logic across product boundaries.

### Migration and Compatibility Strategy
The product suite maintains comprehensive migration paths between SDK versions, with detailed documentation covering API mapping, configuration changes, and breaking changes. The maintenance mode designation for legacy SDKs provides stability for existing implementations while encouraging adoption of newer versions with enhanced capabilities.

## API Endpoints and CLI Commands

### CLI Commands (Ampli)
- `ampli pull`: Downloads the latest tracking plan from Amplitude Data and generates strongly-typed wrapper code
- `ampli status`: Verifies implementation compliance with the defined tracking plan schema

### Core SDK Methods
- `amplitude.init(apiKey, config)`: Initializes the SDK with API key and configuration options
- `amplitude.track(eventType, eventProperties)`: Logs events with specified type and properties
- `amplitude.identify(identify)`: Updates user properties using the Identify interface
- `amplitude.revenue(revenue)`: Tracks revenue events using the Revenue interface
- `amplitude.flush()`: Forces immediate transmission of queued events
- `amplitude.reset()`: Clears user data and resets SDK state

### Configuration Endpoints
- **serverZone**: Accepts 'US' or 'EU' values for data residency compliance
- **serverUrl**: Allows custom endpoint override for event transmission
- **flushIntervalMillis**: Controls automatic batch transmission interval timing
- **flushQueueSize**: Sets event count threshold triggering automatic transmission

### Plugin Integration Points
- `amplitude.add(plugin)`: Registers enrichment or destination plugins with the SDK
- `client.instance`: Provides access to underlying AmplitudeClient for advanced plugin development

The Browser SDK product suite represents a mature, feature-rich analytics platform offering clear evolutionary paths, comprehensive migration support, and deep integration with Amplitude's broader data and experimentation ecosystem. Its modular architecture supports diverse implementation patterns while maintaining consistency across the product family.
