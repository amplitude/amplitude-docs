The Amplitude Browser SDK is a comprehensive web analytics tracking solution that provides multiple JavaScript/TypeScript SDK versions for event tracking, user analytics, and marketing attribution in web applications. The ecosystem integrates with Amplitude's HTTP V2 API to deliver robust analytics capabilities through strongly-typed SDKs with built-in privacy compliance and cross-domain tracking support.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

### Core SDK Offerings

**Browser SDK 2.0** (`@amplitude/analytics-browser`) serves as the flagship product with integrated autocapture functionality for automatic tracking of page views, sessions, form interactions, file downloads, element interactions, and network requests. This version includes built-in marketing attribution tracking with UTM parameters and click ID support, consolidating previously separate analytics packages.

**Browser SDK 1.0** operates in maintenance mode, providing core functionality but requiring separate plugins for advanced features like autocapture and marketing attribution that are now built into version 2.0.

**Legacy JavaScript SDK** (`amplitude-js`) remains available in maintenance mode for existing implementations, though migration to Browser SDK 2.0 is recommended for new projects.

### Specialized Tools and Extensions

**Ampli Wrappers** generate strongly-typed APIs from Amplitude Data tracking plans, available across all SDK versions (Browser SDK 1.0, 2.0, and JavaScript SDK). These wrappers enforce event schema compliance and provide IDE autocompletion for tracking properties through generated CommonJS modules.

**Browser Unified SDK** (`@amplitude/unified`) provides unified initialization for Analytics, Experiment, and Session Replay features through a single `initAll()` method, optimizing bundle size and configuration management.

**Marketing Analytics SDK** (`@amplitude/marketing-analytics-browser`) exists in maintenance mode as a specialized extension for automatic marketing attribution and page view tracking, with functionality now integrated into Browser SDK 2.0.

### Plugin Ecosystem

The architecture supports enrichment and destination plugins including:
- **Autocapture Plugin**: Deprecated standalone plugin, now built into Browser SDK 2.0+
- **Page URL Enrichment Plugin**: Adds comprehensive page URL properties and navigation tracking
- **User Agent Enrichment Plugin**: Provides server-side user agent parsing capabilities

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Core Tracking Methods
- **`track()`**: Primary event logging method replacing legacy `logEvent()`
- **`identify()`**: User property management using Identify interface
- **`load()`/`init()`**: SDK initialization with API keys and configuration
- **`flush()`**: Manual event queue processing, replacing `sendEvents()`

### Configuration Parameters
- **`flushQueueSize`**: Batch size for event transmission
- **`flushIntervalMillis`**: Automatic flush timing interval
- **`identityStorage`**: Storage mechanism (cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage, none)
- **`serverZone`**: Data residency configuration (US/EU)
- **`trackingOptions`**: Granular control over automatic data collection

### Cookie and Storage Management
- **AMP_ prefix**: Cookie naming convention with API key suffix
- **AMP_MKTG_**: Marketing attribution cookie prefix
- **deviceId/sessionId/userId**: Core identity tracking parameters
- **cookieOptions**: Consolidated cookie configuration including expiration, secure, sameSite

### Autocapture Events
- **`[Amplitude] Page Viewed`**: Automatic page view tracking
- **`[Amplitude] Session Started`**: Session initiation events
- **`[Amplitude] Form Started/Submitted`**: Form interaction tracking
- **`[Amplitude] File Downloaded`**: File download monitoring
- **`[Amplitude] Element Clicked`**: Element interaction capture

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The Browser SDK integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics platform through multiple touchpoints. It connects to **Amplitude Data** for tracking plan management and schema validation via Ampli wrappers. The **Browser Unified SDK** creates seamless integration with **Amplitude Experiment** for A/B testing and **Session Replay** for user behavior analysis. Marketing attribution capabilities connect with campaign management tools through UTM parameter tracking and click ID processing.

The SDK ecosystem supports **Amplitude's HTTP V2 API** as the primary transport mechanism, with fallback to browser sendBeacon API for reliable event delivery. Cross-domain tracking enables unified user journeys across multiple properties using deviceId-based identification.

## API Endpoints and Integration Methods

### Installation Patterns
- **Script Loader**: Direct browser integration via CDN
- **NPM/Yarn**: Package manager installation for build systems  
- **Snippet**: Legacy JavaScript implementation pattern

### CLI Commands (Ampli)
- **`ampli pull`**: Download tracking plan and generate typed APIs
- **`ampli status`**: Verify implementation against tracking plan

### Transport Integration
- **HTTP V2 API**: Primary event transmission protocol to Amplitude servers
- **sendBeacon**: Browser API for reliable event delivery during page unload
- **Cross-domain tracking**: deviceId-based user identification across domains

## Compliance and Privacy Features

The SDK provides comprehensive privacy controls including deferred initialization for consent management, `setOptOut()` for user privacy preferences, and GDPR/CNIL compliance features. Data residency options include EU serverZone configuration for European data processing requirements. Storage alternatives support cookie-less tracking, while User Privacy API and DSAR API integration enables data subject rights implementation.

Migration pathways guide users from legacy implementations to Browser SDK 2.0, which represents the convergence point incorporating previously separate marketing analytics and autocapture functionality into a unified solution with enhanced TypeScript support and streamlined plugin architecture.
