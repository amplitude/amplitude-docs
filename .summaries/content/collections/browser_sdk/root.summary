## Amplitude Browser SDK Product Suite

Amplitude's Browser SDK is a comprehensive JavaScript/TypeScript analytics solution for web applications that enables event tracking, user identification, and behavioral analytics. The product suite consists of multiple SDK versions and specialized tools designed to capture user interactions and send analytics data to Amplitude's platform.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

The Browser SDK ecosystem is built around several core products that work together:

**Browser SDK 2.0** (`@amplitude/analytics-browser`) serves as the flagship modern SDK, utilizing the HTTP V2 API and featuring built-in autocapture capabilities, comprehensive marketing attribution tracking, and advanced session management. This represents the current recommended implementation.

**Browser SDK 1.x** operates in maintenance mode, providing similar core functionality but with different configuration patterns and plugin architecture. It serves as a stepping stone between the legacy JavaScript SDK and the modern Browser SDK 2.0.

**Legacy JavaScript SDK** (`amplitude-js`) remains in maintenance mode, representing the original implementation that many existing applications still use. Migration paths are provided to move users toward the modern SDK versions.

**Unified SDK** (`@amplitude/unified`) provides a single entry point for initializing Analytics, Experiment, and Session Replay features together, optimizing bundle size and configuration management across Amplitude's product suite.

**Marketing Analytics SDK** (`@amplitude/marketing-analytics-browser`) extends the Browser SDK with specialized marketing attribution features, though it's now in maintenance mode with functionality integrated into Browser SDK 2.0.

**Ampli Wrappers** generate strongly-typed APIs for each SDK version, providing compile-time validation and autocompletion based on Amplitude Data tracking plans.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Autocapture**: Automated tracking of user interactions including page views, form interactions, file downloads, element clicks, frustration events (rage clicks, dead clicks), and network requests without manual instrumentation.

**Attribution Tracking**: Capture and analysis of marketing campaign data including UTM parameters, click IDs (gclid, fbclid, dclid), referrer information, and campaign attribution across user sessions.

**Device ID and User ID**: Core identifiers where deviceId represents anonymous user tracking and userId represents authenticated user identification, with validation through `minIdLength` configuration.

**Session Management**: Automatic session tracking with configurable timeout periods, cross-domain session continuity using `ampDeviceId` and `ampSessionId` URL parameters, and session storage persistence.

**Plugin Architecture**: Extensible system supporting enrichment plugins (data transformation) and destination plugins (data routing), with interfaces for setup, execute, and teardown lifecycle methods.

**Cookie Management**: First-party cookie implementation using `AMP_{api_key}` naming convention with configurable expiration (default 365 days), secure/sameSite flags, and GDPR compliance options.

**Transport Methods**: Multiple data transmission options including `sendBeacon` for reliable event delivery, standard HTTP requests, and batch processing with configurable `flushQueueSize` and `flushIntervalMillis`.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The Browser SDK integrates deeply with Amplitude's broader analytics and experimentation platform:

**Amplitude Data Integration**: Ampli wrappers connect directly to Amplitude Data tracking plans, generating type-safe event schemas and providing CLI tools (`ampli pull`, `ampli status`) for synchronization.

**Session Replay Compatibility**: Browser SDK 2.0 provides native compatibility with Amplitude's Session Replay product, sharing configuration and initialization through the Unified SDK.

**Experiment Integration**: The Unified SDK enables seamless integration with Amplitude Experiment for A/B testing and feature flagging alongside analytics tracking.

**Server-Side Processing**: Modern SDKs leverage server-side user agent parsing and enrichment, reducing client-side processing overhead while maintaining data accuracy.

**Cross-Domain Tracking**: Enterprise-grade session continuity across multiple domains using URL parameter passing and shared cookie configurations.

## API Endpoints and Implementation Patterns

**Core Initialization Methods**:
- `amplitude.init(apiKey, options)` - Primary SDK initialization
- `initAll()` - Unified SDK initialization for multiple products
- `ampli.load()` - Ampli wrapper initialization

**Event Tracking APIs**:
- `amplitude.track(eventType, eventProperties)` - Core event tracking
- `amplitude.identify(identifyObject)` - User property management
- `amplitude.revenue(revenueObject)` - Revenue event tracking
- `ampli.track.eventName()` - Type-safe event tracking via Ampli

**Configuration Management**:
- `fetchRemoteConfig` - Dynamic configuration retrieval
- `cookieOptions` - Cookie behavior configuration
- `defaultTracking` - Autocapture feature configuration
- `identityStorage` - Storage mechanism selection (cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage, none)

**Plugin Integration**:
- `amplitude.add(plugin)` - Plugin registration
- `@amplitude/plugin-page-url-enrichment-browser` - URL tracking enhancement
- `@amplitude/plugin-user-agent-enrichment-browser` - User agent processing

**Consent Management**:
- `deferInitialization` - GDPR-compliant delayed initialization
- `amplitude.reset()` - User data clearing
- `setOptOut()` - Privacy compliance controls

The SDK suite supports multiple installation methods including script loader, npm/yarn package management, and CDN integration, with comprehensive TypeScript support and compatibility with modern frameworks like Angular, Next.js, and single-page applications.
