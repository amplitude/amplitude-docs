The Amplitude Browser SDK is a comprehensive web analytics tracking solution that provides JavaScript/TypeScript libraries for capturing user behavior, marketing attribution, and custom events in web applications. The ecosystem centers around strongly-typed SDKs that integrate with Amplitude's HTTP V2 API to deliver robust analytics capabilities with automatic data collection, user identification, and cross-device tracking.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

### Core SDK Evolution
The product follows a three-generation evolutionary architecture:

**Legacy JavaScript SDK (amplitude-js)** serves as the foundational maintenance-mode SDK using `amplitude.getInstance()` patterns and `logEvent()` methods with legacy HTTP API integration. This provides the baseline for migration strategies.

**Browser SDK 1.0 (@amplitude/analytics-browser v1)** introduced modern TypeScript implementation with HTTP V2 API integration, plugin architecture, and unified `track()` APIs. This version established strongly-typed event handling and modular plugin systems while transitioning to maintenance mode.

**Browser SDK 2.0 (@amplitude/analytics-browser v2+)** represents the current flagship offering with enhanced autocapture functionality, consolidated marketing attribution, server-side user agent parsing, and streamlined configuration. This version provides comprehensive automatic tracking including page views, session management, and form interactions.

### Specialized SDK Variants

**Marketing Analytics Browser SDK (@amplitude/marketing-analytics-browser)** focuses on automatic marketing attribution with UTM parameter capture, referrer analysis, and click ID tracking (gclid, fbclid, dclid). This maintenance-mode SDK provides first-touch and multi-touch attribution with campaign-based session management.

**Browser Unified SDK (@amplitude/unified)** offers beta integration across Analytics, Experiment, and Session Replay through unified `initAll()` initialization with shared configuration options.

### Code Generation System

**Ampli Wrapper System** generates strongly-typed JavaScript/TypeScript APIs from Amplitude Data tracking plans across all SDK versions. The Ampli CLI provides `pull` and `status` commands for schema synchronization, while generated wrappers offer `load()`, `identify()`, `track()`, and `flush()` methods with compile-time type checking.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Core Tracking Concepts
- **deviceId**: Persistent browser identifier stored in cookies with AMP_ prefix
- **sessionId**: Temporary session identifier for event grouping
- **userId**: Custom user identifier enabling cross-device tracking
- **Autocapture**: Automatic tracking of page views, sessions, form interactions, file downloads, and element interactions
- **defaultTracking**: SDK 2.0 configuration object controlling automatic event collection

### Storage and Cookie Management
- **AMP_{api_key}**: Cookie naming convention combining AMP prefix with API key
- **AMP_MKTG_{api_key}**: Marketing attribution cookie storage pattern
- **identityStorage**: Storage backend configuration (cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage, none)
- **cookieOptions**: Consolidated cookie settings including expiration, secure, sameSite, and domain properties

### Plugin Architecture
- **EnrichmentPlugin**: Plugins modifying event data before transmission
- **DestinationPlugin**: Plugins handling event delivery to endpoints
- **Plugin Interface**: Simplified plugin structure with optional properties in SDK 2.0

### Attribution and Marketing
- **Web Attribution V1/V2**: Marketing attribution systems with UTM parameter capture
- **resetSessionOnNewCampaign**: Campaign-based session management configuration
- **excludeReferrers**: Referrer filtering for attribution accuracy
- **trackHistoryChanges**: Single-page application navigation tracking

## Integration Patterns and API Endpoints

### Initialization Methods
- **amplitude.init(apiKey, options)**: Standard SDK initialization
- **initAll()**: Unified SDK initialization for multiple Amplitude products
- **deferInitialization**: Consent management pattern for GDPR compliance

### Event Tracking APIs
- **amplitude.track(eventType, eventProperties)**: Primary event tracking method
- **amplitude.identify(identifyObject)**: User property management
- **amplitude.revenue(revenueObject)**: Revenue event tracking
- **amplitude.flush()**: Force event queue transmission

### Advanced Configuration
- **flushQueueSize/flushIntervalMillis**: Batch processing configuration
- **sendBeacon**: Browser beacon API transport for reliable delivery
- **serverZone**: EU data residency configuration
- **trackingOptions**: Granular control over automatic data collection

### Plugin Management
- **amplitude.add(plugin)**: Plugin registration for SDK extensions
- **autocapturePlugin()**: Built-in autocapture functionality configuration

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The Browser SDK integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics platform through HTTP V2 API endpoints, supporting EU data residency via serverZone configuration and cross-product functionality through the Unified SDK. The ecosystem connects with Amplitude Data for schema management via Ampli code generation, Amplitude Experiment for feature flagging, and Session Replay for user behavior analysis.

The SDKs support comprehensive privacy compliance including GDPR consent management through deferred initialization, CNIL France exemption handling, opt-out mechanisms via `setOptOut()` methods, and configurable data retention policies. Cookie management provides secure, SameSite, and cross-domain configurations with automatic localStorage fallback.

Migration paths maintain backward compatibility across SDK versions with detailed breaking change documentation, configuration mapping guides, and API transformation instructions, encouraging adoption of Browser SDK 2.0 for enhanced autocapture, consolidated attribution tracking, and improved plugin architecture.
