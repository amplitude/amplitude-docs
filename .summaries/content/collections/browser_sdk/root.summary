# Amplitude Browser SDK Product Overview

## High-Level Overview

The Amplitude Browser SDK is a JavaScript/TypeScript library for tracking user events and analytics in web applications. It enables developers to capture user interactions, identify users, track revenue events, and gather marketing attribution data. The SDK has evolved through multiple versions, with Browser SDK 2.0 being the current recommended version, while older versions (Browser SDK 1.0 and JavaScript SDK) are maintained but not actively developed.

Key features include:
- Event tracking (both manual and automatic)
- User identification and property management
- Revenue tracking
- Marketing attribution capture
- Session management
- Cross-domain tracking
- Offline support and event batching
- Plugin architecture for extensibility

## Product Relationships and Features

### SDK Version Evolution

The Browser SDK has evolved through several iterations:

1. **JavaScript SDK (Legacy)**: The original implementation, now in maintenance mode.
2. **Browser SDK 1.0**: Introduced TypeScript support and plugin architecture, now in maintenance mode.
3. **Browser SDK 2.0**: The current recommended version featuring a simplified API, enhanced functionality, and consolidated features from previous specialized SDKs.
4. **Marketing Analytics Browser SDK**: A specialized version focused on attribution tracking that has now been consolidated into Browser SDK 2.0.

### Ampli Wrapper

The Ampli Wrapper sits on top of the Browser SDK, providing type safety and schema enforcement based on Amplitude Data tracking plans. It offers:
- Type-safe event tracking with autocompletion
- Validation against predefined schemas
- Prevention of instrumentation errors
- Support for both JavaScript and TypeScript

Ampli Wrapper versions exist for all three SDK generations (JavaScript SDK, Browser SDK 1.0, and Browser SDK 2.0).

### Feature Categories

- **Group Management**: Associate users with organizations or groups
- **Revenue Tracking**: Capture purchase and monetization events

#### Advanced Capabilities
- **Autocapture**: Automatically track clicks, form submissions, and other interactions
- **Marketing Attribution**: Track UTM parameters, referrers, and click IDs
- **Session Management**: Configure session timeouts and track user sessions
- **Cross-Domain Tracking**: Maintain user identity across different domains

- **EU Data Residency**: Configure for compliance with EU data storage requirements

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: A discrete user action or occurrence tracked in the system
- **User Properties**: Attributes associated with a specific user (e.g., name, email, plan type)
- **Device ID**: Automatically generated unique identifier for a device/browser
- **User ID**: Custom identifier assigned to a specific user, typically from your authentication system
- **Session**: A period of user activity, typically ending after a period of inactivity
- **Tracking Plan**: Schema defining expected events and properties in Amplitude Data
- **Autocapture**: Automatic tracking of user interactions without manual instrumentation
- **Marketing Attribution**: Tracking which marketing channels and campaigns drive user acquisition
- **Plugin**: Extension module that adds functionality to the SDK
- **Flush**: Process of sending batched events to Amplitude servers
- **Identity Storage**: Methods for storing user identity (cookies, localStorage, etc.)
- **First-touch Attribution**: Crediting the first marketing touchpoint in a user's journey
- **Multi-touch Attribution**: Tracking multiple marketing touchpoints throughout a user's journey

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Browser SDK is a key component in Amplitude's broader product ecosystem:

1. **Amplitude Analytics**: The Browser SDK sends event data to Amplitude Analytics for processing, analysis, and visualization.

2. **Amplitude Data**: The Ampli Wrapper connects with Amplitude Data tracking plans to enforce consistent event schemas across the organization.

3. **Cross-Platform Tracking**: Works alongside other Amplitude SDKs (Mobile, Server) to provide a complete view of the user journey across different platforms and touchpoints.

4. **Plugin Ecosystem**: Supports extensions through plugins for additional functionality, such as specialized tracking or integration with other tools.
