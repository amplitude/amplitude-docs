The Amplitude Browser SDK is a comprehensive JavaScript/TypeScript analytics platform designed for web applications, providing event tracking, user identification, and marketing attribution capabilities. The ecosystem consists of multiple SDK versions, specialized plugins, and code generation tools that work together to deliver robust analytics functionality.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

### Core SDK Evolution
The product ecosystem centers around three main SDK generations:

**Legacy JavaScript SDK (amplitude-js)** - The original maintenance-mode SDK that established core patterns like `amplitude.getInstance()`, `logEvent()`, and cookie-based storage with AMP_ prefixes. This SDK uses HTTP V1 API endpoints and provides foundational features like user identification, revenue tracking, and basic attribution.

**Browser SDK 1.0 (@amplitude/analytics-browser v1)** - The first modern TypeScript SDK that introduced HTTP V2 API, plugin architecture, and promise-based APIs. It replaced the getInstance pattern with direct initialization and consolidated event tracking under a unified `track()` method.

**Browser SDK 2.0 (@amplitude/analytics-browser v2+)** - The current flagship SDK featuring built-in autocapture functionality, enhanced marketing attribution, consolidated configuration options under `defaultTracking`, and server-side user agent parsing. This version provides the most comprehensive feature set including automatic page view tracking, form interactions, file downloads, and element interactions.

### Specialized SDKs and Extensions

**Marketing Analytics Browser SDK (@amplitude/marketing-analytics-browser)** - A maintenance-mode extension of Browser SDK 1.0 that provides enhanced marketing attribution tracking including UTM parameters, referrer data, click IDs (gclid, fbclid, dclid), and configurable first-touch/multi-touch attribution models.

**Browser Unified SDK (@amplitude/unified)** - A beta integration layer that provides a single entry point for initializing Analytics, Experiment, and Session Replay products through the `initAll()` method with shared configuration options.

### Code Generation and Type Safety

**Ampli Wrappers** - Strongly-typed code generation tools that create JavaScript/TypeScript APIs from Amplitude Data tracking plans:
- Ampli for Browser SDK 1.0/2.0 (@amplitude/ampli)
- Ampli for JavaScript SDK (legacy)

These wrappers generate CJS modules with methods like `ampli.load()`, `ampli.identify()`, `ampli.track()`, and `ampli.flush()`, providing compile-time type checking and autocompletion for event properties.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Core Tracking Concepts
- **Event Tracking**: Primary analytics function using `track()` (modern SDKs) or `logEvent()` (legacy)
- **User Identification**: Associating events with users via `identify()` and user properties
- **Device ID**: Persistent identifier stored in cookies/localStorage with AMP_ prefix
- **Session Management**: Automatic session tracking with configurable timeout periods
- **Revenue Tracking**: Specialized event type for e-commerce using Revenue interface

### Configuration and Storage
- **Cookie Naming**: AMP_{api_key}_{property} pattern for first-party cookie storage
- **Identity Storage**: Configurable storage backends (cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage, none)
- **Server Zone**: Data residency configuration (US/EU) via serverZone parameter
- **Transport**: Event delivery mechanism (fetch, sendBeacon, XHR)

### Plugin Architecture
- **Enrichment Plugins**: Modify events before sending (user agent, page URL, attribution)
- **Destination Plugins**: Handle event delivery and batching
- **Plugin Interface**: Standardized setup(), execute(), teardown() lifecycle methods

### Autocapture and Attribution
- **Default Tracking**: Automatic event collection for page views, sessions, forms, file downloads
- **Marketing Attribution**: UTM parameter and referrer tracking with campaign attribution
- **Element Interactions**: Click tracking with CSS selector allowlists
- **Network Tracking**: HTTP request monitoring with configurable options

## API Endpoints and Commands

### CLI Commands (Ampli)
- `ampli pull` - Download tracking plan and generate typed code
- `ampli status` - Verify implementation against tracking plan

### Core SDK Methods
- `amplitude.init(apiKey, options)` - Initialize SDK with configuration
- `amplitude.track(eventType, eventProperties)` - Send custom events
- `amplitude.identify(identify)` - Set user properties
- `amplitude.setUserId(userId)` - Associate events with user
- `amplitude.setDeviceId(deviceId)` - Set device identifier
- `amplitude.flush()` - Force send queued events
- `amplitude.reset()` - Clear user data and reset state

### Configuration Options
- `flushQueueSize` / `flushIntervalMillis` - Batching configuration
- `trackingOptions` - Control automatic data collection
- `cookieOptions.expiration` - Cookie lifetime management
- `defaultTracking.attribution` - Marketing attribution settings
- `autocapture` - Element interaction tracking configuration

### HTTP Endpoints
- **HTTP V2 API** - Modern event ingestion endpoint used by Browser SDK 1.0/2.0
- **HTTP V1 API** - Legacy endpoint used by amplitude-js

## Ecosystem Integration

The Browser SDK ecosystem integrates with broader Amplitude platform services including Amplitude Data for schema management, Amplitude Experiment for feature flagging, and Session Replay for user experience monitoring. The unified SDK approach enables shared configuration and coordinated initialization across these products.

Migration paths are clearly defined between SDK versions, with comprehensive documentation covering breaking changes, configuration mapping, and feature evolution. The plugin system allows for extensibility while maintaining core functionality, and the Ampli code generation tools bridge the gap between schema definition and implementation.

The ecosystem supports modern web development practices including Content Security Policy compliance, cross-domain tracking, offline mode operation, and integration with popular frameworks and build tools through npm/yarn package management.
