The Amplitude Browser SDK is a comprehensive web analytics tracking ecosystem built around strongly-typed JavaScript/TypeScript libraries that integrate with Amplitude's analytics platform. The product provides event tracking, user analytics, and marketing attribution capabilities for web applications through multiple SDK versions and specialized tools.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

The ecosystem follows a clear evolutionary architecture with four main SDK tiers:

**Legacy JavaScript SDK (amplitude-js)** serves as the original maintenance-mode foundation using HTTP V1 API with `getInstance()` patterns and `logEvent()` methods.

**Browser SDK 1.0** (`@amplitude/analytics-browser@1.x`) represents the first-generation TypeScript implementation in maintenance mode, introducing HTTP V2 API, plugin architecture, and `track()` methods.

**Browser SDK 2.0** (`@amplitude/analytics-browser@2.x`) functions as the current flagship SDK featuring built-in autocapture, enhanced attribution tracking, improved cookie management, and server-side user agent parsing.

**Browser Unified SDK** (`@amplitude/unified`) operates as a beta integration layer providing unified initialization for Analytics, Experiment, and Session Replay products through `initAll()`.

The **Marketing Analytics Browser SDK** (`@amplitude/marketing-analytics-browser`) extends the ecosystem as a maintenance-mode tool focused on automatic UTM parameter tracking, referrer attribution, and campaign-based session management.

**Ampli Wrappers** provide code generation capabilities creating strongly-typed tracking APIs from Amplitude Data tracking plans, supporting JavaScript SDK, Browser SDK 1.0, and Browser SDK 2.0.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Core Tracking Interface
- **track()** - Primary event logging method replacing legacy `logEvent()`
- **identify()** - User property management using Identify interface
- **Autocapture** - Automatic tracking of page views, sessions, form interactions, file downloads, and element interactions
- **Attribution Tracking** - Automatic capture of UTM parameters, referrer data, and click IDs (gclid, fbclid, dclid)

### Storage and Configuration
- **AMP_ Cookie Prefix** - Standard naming convention using `AMP_{api_key}` format for device ID, session ID, and user ID persistence
- **identityStorage** - Configurable storage options including cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage, or none
- **deviceId** - Persistent device identifier for cross-session tracking
- **sessionId** - Temporary session identifier with configurable timeout
- **serverZone** - Data residency configuration (US/EU)

### Plugin Architecture
- **Enrichment Plugins** - Modify event data before sending (Page URL Enrichment, User Agent Enrichment)
- **Destination Plugins** - Handle event transmission and storage
- **Plugin Interface** - Standardized plugin structure with setup(), execute(), and teardown() methods

### Advanced Capabilities
- **Cross-domain Tracking** - Device ID sharing via URL parameters (`ampDeviceId`)
- **sendBeacon Transport** - Reliable event transmission using Navigator.sendBeacon API
- **Deferred Initialization** - Consent management pattern for GDPR/CNIL compliance
- **Remote Configuration** - Server-side SDK configuration via `fetchRemoteConfig()`

## API Endpoints and Integration Methods

### Installation Patterns
```javascript
// Script loader
<script src="https://cdn.amplitude.com/libs/analytics-browser-2.0.0-min.js.gz"></script>

// Package manager
npm install @amplitude/analytics-browser
```

### Core API Methods
- `amplitude.init(apiKey, options)` - SDK initialization
- `amplitude.track(eventType, eventProperties)` - Event tracking
- `amplitude.identify(identifyObject)` - User property updates
- `amplitude.revenue(revenueObject)` - Revenue tracking
- `amplitude.setUserId(userId)` - User identification
- `amplitude.setDeviceId(deviceId)` - Device identification
- `amplitude.flush()` - Force event transmission
- `amplitude.reset()` - Clear user data and regenerate device ID

### Ampli CLI Commands
- `ampli pull` - Generate tracking code from Amplitude Data tracking plans
- `ampli status` - Verify implementation against tracking plan

Configuration operates through parameters including `flushQueueSize`, `flushIntervalMillis`, `trackingOptions`, `cookieOptions`, `defaultTracking`, `autocapture`, and `attribution` settings.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The Browser SDK integrates with multiple Amplitude platform components:

**Amplitude Data** provides tracking plan schemas for Ampli code generation and event validation.

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the core event ingestion and analysis platform receiving data via HTTP V2 API.

**Amplitude Experiment** offers feature flagging services integrated through the Unified SDK.

**Amplitude Session Replay** provides user session recording capabilities integrated through the Unified SDK with shared configuration.

**Content Security Policy (CSP)** support enables nonce-based CSP implementation for secure deployments.

The migration strategy guides users through the progression: legacy JavaScript SDK → Browser SDK 1.0 → Browser SDK 2.0, supported by comprehensive migration documentation and backward compatibility considerations. The ecosystem emphasizes type safety, automatic tracking capabilities, and flexible plugin architecture while maintaining privacy regulation compliance through robust consent management features.
