The Amplitude Browser SDK is a comprehensive web analytics tracking solution that provides JavaScript/TypeScript libraries for capturing user behavior, marketing attribution, and custom events in web applications. The ecosystem centers around strongly-typed SDKs that integrate with Amplitude's HTTP V2 API to deliver robust analytics capabilities with built-in privacy compliance and performance optimization features.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

### Core SDK Offerings

**Browser SDK 2.0** (`@amplitude/analytics-browser`) serves as the flagship product, featuring comprehensive autocapture functionality that automatically tracks page views, sessions, form interactions, file downloads, element interactions, and network requests without manual instrumentation. This SDK includes integrated marketing attribution with automatic UTM parameter capture, referrer tracking, and click ID collection (gclid, fbclid, dclid).

**Browser SDK 1.0** operates in maintenance mode, providing foundational analytics capabilities without the advanced autocapture features of version 2.0. Both current SDKs utilize the HTTP V2 API and offer full TypeScript/JavaScript support.

**Legacy JavaScript SDK** (`amplitude-js`) remains available in maintenance mode for existing implementations, though migration to Browser SDK 2.0 is recommended for new projects.

### Specialized Extensions and Unified Solutions

**Marketing Analytics Browser SDK** (`@amplitude/marketing-analytics-browser`) previously extended core functionality with enhanced marketing attribution capabilities but is now in maintenance mode, with its features consolidated into Browser SDK 2.0's default tracking.

**Unified SDK** (`@amplitude/unified`) provides a single initialization point for Analytics, Experiment, and Session Replay products through the `initAll()` method, optimizing bundle size and configuration management across the entire Amplitude product suite.

### Code Generation and Type Safety

**Ampli Wrappers** generate strongly-typed APIs from Amplitude Data tracking plans, available for Browser SDK 1.0, 2.0, and JavaScript SDK implementations. These wrappers utilize the Ampli CLI with commands like `ampli pull` and `ampli status` to synchronize tracking schemas and provide compile-time type checking for event properties.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Core Tracking Concepts

- **deviceId**: Persistent identifier stored in cookies with `AMP_` prefix and API key suffix for cross-session user recognition
- **userId**: User-specific identifier for authenticated user tracking across sessions and devices  
- **sessionId**: Temporary identifier for grouping events within a user session
- **Autocapture**: Automatic tracking of user interactions without manual event instrumentation
- **Default Tracking**: Built-in event collection for attribution, page views, sessions, and user interactions

### Storage and Identity Management

The SDK implements a sophisticated cookie system using `AMP_{api_key}` naming conventions for first-party cookies. Marketing attribution data uses `AMP_MKTG_{api_key}` prefixes. The `identityStorage` configuration supports multiple storage backends including cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage, or none for cookieless implementations.

### Plugin Architecture

The SDK employs an extensible plugin system with two primary types:
- **Enrichment Plugins**: Modify event data before transmission to add context or transform properties
- **Destination Plugins**: Handle event delivery to various endpoints and services

Notable plugins include the Page URL Enrichment plugin for automatic URL property addition and the deprecated Autocapture plugin (functionality now built into Browser SDK 2.0).

### Core API Methods

Primary tracking methods include:
- `track()`: Log custom events with properties and context
- `identify()`: Set user properties using Identify objects
- `flush()`: Force immediate transmission of queued events
- `load()`/`init()`: SDK initialization with configuration options
- `setGroup()`: Assign users to groups for organizational analytics

## Integration Patterns and Configuration

### Consent Management and Privacy Compliance

The SDK provides comprehensive consent management through deferred initialization patterns, supporting GDPR compliance and CNIL France exemptions for first-party analytics cookies. The `deferInitialization` option combined with `enableTracking()` enables consent-first implementations that respect user privacy preferences.

### Transport and Performance Optimization

Multiple transport mechanisms accommodate various deployment scenarios:
- **sendBeacon**: Browser-native reliable event transmission that persists through page navigation
- **fetch/xhr**: Standard HTTP transport methods with fallback capabilities
- **Batch processing**: Configurable via `flushQueueSize` and `flushIntervalMillis` for optimized network usage

### Attribution and Cross-Domain Tracking

Advanced features include cross-domain tracking via shared deviceId parameters, UTM parameter preservation across sessions, and campaign-based session management through `resetSessionOnNewCampaign` configuration for accurate marketing attribution.

### Security and Content Policy Integration

The SDK supports Content Security Policy (CSP) implementations with configurable security headers and provides secure cookie options including `sameSite` and `secure` flags for enhanced privacy protection in modern web environments.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The Browser SDK integrates seamlessly with Amplitude's broader analytics platform, connecting to Amplitude Data for schema management, Amplitude Experiment for feature flagging, and Session Replay for user experience analysis. The HTTP V2 API serves as the backbone for data transmission, while the Ampli CLI bridges the gap between tracking plan definition and implementation.

Migration pathways are well-defined for transitioning between SDK versions, with comprehensive guides addressing breaking changes in API methods, configuration options, and architectural differences. The ecosystem emphasizes backward compatibility while encouraging adoption of Browser SDK 2.0 for optimal feature availability and long-term support.
