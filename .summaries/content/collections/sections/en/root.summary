# Amplitude Product Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and product optimization platform that helps businesses understand user behavior, improve product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven decisions. The platform combines behavioral analytics, experimentation capabilities, customer data management, and engagement tools in an integrated ecosystem.

## Key Features and Products

### Analytics
Amplitude's core analytics platform provides behavioral analytics and AI automation to help users answer growth questions without coding. It unifies data to facilitate product improvement and offers no-code analytics capabilities for tracking user interactions and product performance.

### Data
Amplitude Data offers tools for data integration, identity resolution across devices, and customer/product data management. It enables cross-device tracking, tech stack integration, and provides data quality tools. The platform supports data warehouse native capabilities for comprehensive data management.

### Experiment
Amplitude Experiment provides feature flagging and experimentation capabilities including:
- A/B testing
- Multivariate experiments
- Multi-armed Bandit optimization
- Remote configuration
- Web experimentation (no-code experimentation)

The platform includes SDKs, APIs, and a demo environment for implementing and managing experiments.

### Web Experiment
A specialized feature (possibly in partnership with LaunchDarkly) that enables running experiments on websites without coding. It supports A/B, multivariate, and Multi-armed bandit tests with targeting capabilities, performance considerations, and post-experiment actions for landing page and conversion optimization.

### Session Replay
This feature provides qualitative insights by recording and playing back user sessions. It allows teams to:
- Understand user behavior beyond quantitative metrics
- Troubleshoot issues
- Improve product conversions
- Directly observe user interactions with timestamps
- Synchronize events with user actions

Session Replay includes search and filtering capabilities, dashboard integration, and element masking for privacy.

### Guides and Surveys
A platform feature that provides an alternative to popup components for:
- User onboarding
- Product feedback collection
- User journey optimization
- Customer communication
- Improving key metrics like retention, activation, and engagement

### CDP (Customer Data Platform)
A customer data platform natively integrated with analytics that helps:
- Proactively improve data quality
- Discover new audiences
- Sync behavioral data across the technology stack

## Product Ecosystem and Relationships

Amplitude's products are designed to work together in an integrated ecosystem:

1. **Data Collection and Management**: SDKs and Data products form the foundation, collecting and organizing user behavior data.
2. **Analysis and Insights**: Analytics provides the tools to understand this data and derive insights.
3. **Testing and Optimization**: Experiment and Web Experiment enable testing hypotheses and optimizing based on insights.
4. **User Engagement**: Guides and Surveys and Session Replay help understand and improve the user experience.
5. **Data Activation**: CDP enables activating insights by creating audiences and syncing data across tools.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **SDKs (Software Development Kits)**: Libraries for implementing Amplitude in different platforms, categorized as:
  - Analytics SDKs
  - Experiment SDKs
  - Session Replay SDKs
  - Guides and Surveys SDKs

- **Ampli CLI and Wrapper**: Tools for type-safe tracking implementation

- **Client-side vs Server-side**: Implementation approaches for Amplitude SDKs
