## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Behavioral analytics**: Analysis of user actions and interactions within a product
- **Feature flagging**: Technique to enable/disable features for specific users
- **A/B testing**: Comparing two versions of a page or feature to determine which performs better
- **Multivariate testing**: Testing multiple variables simultaneously
- **Multi-armed Bandit**: Experimentation approach that automatically optimizes for the best-performing variation
- **Identity resolution**: Process of connecting multiple identifiers to a single user
- **Session Replay**: Recording and playback of user interactions with a website or application
- **CDP (Customer Data Platform)**: System that unifies customer data from multiple sources
- **Tracking Plan**: Specification that defines events and properties to be collected
