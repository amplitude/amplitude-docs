Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides behavioral analytics, customer data management, and product optimization tools for businesses to understand and improve user experiences. The platform consists of several integrated products designed to help teams make data-driven decisions about product development and user engagement.

## Core Product Architecture

The Amplitude ecosystem is built around five primary products that work together to provide end-to-end analytics and optimization capabilities:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundation, offering behavioral analytics with AI automation for product growth insights. It enables teams to answer growth questions without coding skills and provides data unification across touchpoints.

**Amplitude Data** functions as the data integration layer, connecting with existing tech stacks and providing cross-device identity resolution. It focuses on improving data quality and managing both customer and product data through warehouse-native capabilities.

**Amplitude CDP (Customer Data Platform)** is natively integrated with analytics to help teams proactively improve data quality, discover new audiences, and sync behavioral data across their entire technology stack.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides comprehensive experimentation capabilities including feature flagging, A/B testing, multivariate experiments, and Multi-armed Bandit experiments. It supports both traditional experimentation and advanced optimization techniques.

**Amplitude Session Replay** enables visual analysis of user behavior through session recordings, accessible via User Look-Up, various chart types (Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Journeys, User Sessions), and homepage widgets.

## Key Features and Capabilities

The platform offers **Web Experiment** functionality for no-code A/B testing and multivariate testing with one-line code installation, targeting capabilities, and performance optimization. **Guides and Surveys** provides an alternative to popup components for user onboarding, feedback collection, and improving retention, activation, and engagement metrics throughout the user journey.

**Session Replay** includes advanced filtering by cohorts, events, properties, and session duration, with support for custom session definitions, account-level reporting, and HTML element masking for privacy compliance.

## Technical Implementation

Amplitude provides extensive **SDK support** with both client-side and server-side implementation options. The SDK catalog includes Analytics SDKs, Experiment SDKs, Session Replay SDKs, and Guides/Surveys SDKs. The platform features the **Ampli CLI** and code-generated **Ampli Wrapper** for type-safe tracking plan implementation with static type checking and autocomplete functionality.

**API infrastructure** includes Analytics/Data APIs, Experiment APIs, and Guides/Surveys Translation API, with comprehensive authentication using Amplitude keys, tokens, SCIM tokens, org API keys, and secret keys. Postman collection integration is available for API testing and development.

## Administrative and Developer Resources

The platform includes **administrative capabilities** for billing, account management, and single sign-on integration. **Developer resources** encompass SDK documentation, API references, and integration guides. The **Partners** section provides information about third-party integrations and ecosystem connections.

## Data Management and Quality

Amplitude emphasizes data quality through ingestion monitoring, throttling management (including 429 error handling), and comprehensive data validation. The platform supports various event types including Autocapture events (Page Viewed, Element Clicked, Element Changed) and custom event tracking with property-based filtering and analysis.

The documentation structure indicates a mature platform with comprehensive onboarding flows, FAQ resources, and detailed technical documentation across all product areas, designed to support teams from initial setup through advanced implementation and optimization workflows.
