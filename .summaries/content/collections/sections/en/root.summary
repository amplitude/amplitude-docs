### CDP (Customer Data Platform)
Amplitude's CDP is natively integrated with analytics to help:
- Proactively improve data quality
- Discover new audiences
- Sync behavioral data across technology stacks

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **SDKs (Software Development Kits)**: Libraries for implementing Amplitude in applications, available in four categories:
  - Analytics SDKs
  - Experiment SDKs
  - Session Replay SDKs
  - Guides and Surveys SDKs

- **Ampli CLI and Wrapper**: Tools for implementing type-safe tracking in applications

- **Client-side vs. Server-side**: Implementation approaches for Amplitude SDKs:
  - Client-side: Implemented directly in user-facing applications
  - Server-side: Implemented on backend servers

- **APIs**: Amplitude offers several API categories:
  - Analytics and Data APIs
  - Experiment APIs
  - Guides and Surveys Translation API

- **Web Experiment**: A feature allowing no-code A/B, multivariate, and Multi-armed bandit experiments on websites

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's products are designed to work together as an integrated ecosystem:

1. **Data Collection and Management**: The foundation begins with Amplitude Data and SDKs for collecting and managing user behavior data across platforms.

2. **Analytics and Insights**: The core Analytics platform processes this data to provide insights into user behavior and product performance.

3. **Experimentation and Optimization**: Feature Experiment and Web Experiment leverage these insights to test and optimize product experiences.

4. **User Engagement**: Guides and Surveys use behavioral data to deliver targeted in-app experiences and collect feedback.

5. **Session Analysis**: Session Replay provides qualitative context to the quantitative data collected through the platform.

6. **Partner Integrations**: Amplitude connects with partner tools and platforms to extend its capabilities.

## API Endpoints and Implementation

Amplitude provides several API categories for programmatic access:

- **Analytics and Data APIs**: For sending and retrieving analytics data
- **Experiment APIs**: For managing feature flags and experiments
- **Guides and Surveys Translation API**: For translating in-app content

Authentication for APIs is handled through keys and tokens, and Amplitude provides a Postman collection for testing API requests.

For implementation, Amplitude offers SDKs across multiple platforms and languages, with both client-side and server-side options available. The Ampli CLI and Wrapper provide additional tools for type-safe tracking implementation.

The platform also includes administrative features for organization management, billing, account management, and single sign-on capabilities.
