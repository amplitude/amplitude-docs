Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides behavioral analytics, customer data management, and product optimization tools for businesses to understand and improve user experiences across their digital products.

## Core Product Suite

The platform consists of six primary products that work together to provide end-to-end analytics and optimization capabilities:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational behavioral analytics platform, offering AI-powered automation for product growth analysis. It includes specialized analysis types such as funnel analysis, retention analysis, event segmentation, user sessions, revenue LTV tracking, engagement matrices, impact analysis, user personas, stickiness analysis, user journeys, and data tables with compass and charts functionality.

**Amplitude Data** functions as a customer data platform (CDP) natively integrated with analytics, focusing on data quality improvement, audience discovery, and behavioral data synchronization across technology stacks. It provides cross-device identity resolution, warehouse-native capabilities, and comprehensive customer/product data control.

**Amplitude Experiment** enables feature flagging and experimentation through A/B testing, multivariate experiments, and Multi-armed Bandit experiments. It supports both programmatic implementation via SDKs/APIs and no-code web experimentation with one-line JavaScript installation.

**Session Replay** provides qualitative insights from quantitative data by recording user sessions viewable from User Look-Up, various chart types (Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Journeys, User Sessions, Experiments), and the homepage, with event stream synchronization and advanced filtering capabilities.

**Guides and Surveys** offers an alternative to popup components for user onboarding and feedback collection, designed to improve product metrics like retention, activation, and engagement throughout the user journey.

**Web Experiment** specifically focuses on no-code A/B testing, multivariate testing, and multi-armed bandit experiments with targeting capabilities, performance optimization, impression tracking, and post-experiment workflows.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

The platform uses several core concepts:
- **Event Segmentation**: Analysis of user actions and behaviors
- **Funnel Analysis**: Tracking user progression through defined steps
- **Retention Analysis**: Measuring user return behavior over time
- **Revenue LTV**: Lifetime value tracking and analysis
- **Cross-device Identity Resolution**: Connecting user behavior across multiple devices
- **Behavioral Data**: User interaction data collected across digital touchpoints
- **Multi-armed Bandit**: Algorithmic approach to experiment optimization
- **Impression Tracking**: Recording when users are exposed to experiments
- **Ampli CLI/Wrapper**: Code-generated SDK for type-safe tracking plan implementation

## Technical Implementation

The platform provides comprehensive API coverage including Analytics/Data APIs, Experiment APIs, and Guides/Surveys Translation API, with authentication through various key types (org_api_key, org_secret_key, SCIM tokens). Postman collection integration is available for API testing and development.

SDK support spans both client-side and server-side implementations, with specialized SDKs for Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, and Guides/Surveys. The Ampli CLI and Ampli Wrapper provide type-safe tracking plan implementation with static type checking and autocomplete functionality.

## Administrative and Support Infrastructure

The platform includes robust administrative capabilities covering billing, account management, and single sign-on integration. A comprehensive FAQ and troubleshooting library provides support across all products and features. Partner integrations extend the platform's capabilities through third-party connections.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's architecture emphasizes native integration between its analytics and CDP capabilities, enabling seamless data flow between behavioral analysis and customer data management. The experimentation tools integrate directly with analytics for comprehensive performance measurement, while Session Replay provides qualitative context to quantitative insights. The platform supports warehouse-native deployments and extensive third-party integrations through its partner ecosystem, positioning it as a central hub for product analytics and optimization workflows.
