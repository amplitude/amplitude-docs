# Amplitude Product Suite

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics platform that helps businesses understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of several integrated products designed to work together to provide a complete solution for product teams.

## Core Products Overview

### Analytics
Amplitude's core analytics platform provides behavioral analytics and AI automation to help users answer growth questions without coding. It unifies data to facilitate product improvement with no-code analytics capabilities, enabling teams to track user behavior, identify patterns, measure product performance, and make data-driven decisions.

### Data
Amplitude Data serves as the foundation for the platform, providing tools for data integration across tech stacks, cross-device identity resolution, data quality validation, customer data management, product data control, and native integration with data warehouses.

### Experiment
This product enables teams to run controlled experiments to optimize features and user experiences through:
- Feature flagging for controlled rollouts
- A/B testing to compare variations
- Multivariate experiments for testing multiple variables
- Multi-armed Bandit experiments for optimization
- Remote configuration management

### Web Experiment
A specialized feature within Experiment that allows running experiments on websites without coding, including code-free experimentation capabilities, advanced targeting options, performance optimization, impression tracking, post-experiment actions, and landing page optimization.

### Session Replay
A qualitative analytics tool that records and plays back user sessions to visualize journeys, synchronize with event streams, diagnose bugs, analyze user experience, share replays with team members, and apply search filters to find specific sessions.

### Guides and Surveys
An alternative to popup components for improving user experience through in-app messaging, user onboarding, product feedback collection, user journey optimization, and cross-functional team collaboration.

### CDP (Customer Data Platform)
A customer data platform natively integrated with analytics that helps improve data quality, discover new audiences, and sync behavioral data across technology stacks.

## Product Relationships and Integration

The Amplitude ecosystem is designed as an integrated platform where:

1. **Data** forms the foundation, ensuring quality information flows into the system
2. **Analytics** builds on this data to provide actionable insights
3. **Experiment** enables testing hypotheses derived from analytics
4. **Session Replay** provides qualitative validation of quantitative findings
5. **Guides and Surveys** facilitates direct user engagement based on insights
6. **CDP** connects user data across the entire tech stack

This integrated approach creates a seamless workflow from data collection to insight generation to action, allowing teams to make informed product decisions.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: A tracked user action or occurrence in Amplitude
- **User Property**: Attributes associated with specific users
- **Cohort**: A group of users sharing common characteristics
- **Feature Flag**: A toggle enabling/disabling features for specific users
- **Experiment**: A controlled test comparing different variations
- **Variant**: A specific version in an experiment
- **Session**: A period of continuous user activity
- **Impression**: When a user is exposed to an experiment
- **Conversion**: When a user completes a desired action

## Implementation Tools

### SDKs
Amplitude provides various SDKs categorized by product:
- **Analytics SDKs**: For sending event data
- **Experiment SDKs**: For implementing feature flags and experiments
- **Session Replay SDKs**: For recording user sessions
