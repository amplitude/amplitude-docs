## Product Relationships and Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's products form an integrated ecosystem:
1. **Data Collection Layer**: SDKs and APIs capture user interactions
2. **Data Management Layer**: CDP and Data products ensure quality and identity resolution
3. **Analysis Layer**: Analytics provides insights from collected data
4. **Action Layer**: Experiment enables testing, Guides facilitates engagement, Session Replay provides qualitative context

The platform is designed for a closed-loop workflow where insights drive experiments, experiments lead to optimizations, and the cycle continues with new data collection.

## Developer Resources

### SDKs
Multiple SDK categories are available:
- Analytics SDKs for event data
- Experiment SDKs for feature flagging and A/B testing
- Session Replay SDKs for capturing user sessions
- Guides and Surveys SDKs for in-app messaging

Both client-side and server-side implementations are supported.

The Ampli CLI and Wrapper provide type-safe event tracking based on Tracking Plans.

### APIs
Amplitude offers two main API categories:
1. **Analytics/Data APIs**: For programmatic data access
   - Endpoint examples include `/api/2/events` for sending events and `/api/2/export` for data export
   
2. **Experiment APIs**: For managing feature flags and experiments
   - Endpoints include `/api/2/flags` for feature flag management

Authentication uses API keys and tokens, with a Postman collection available for testing.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Behavioral analytics**: Analysis of user actions within a product
- **Feature flagging**: Technique to enable/disable features for specific users
- **A/B testing**: Comparing two versions to determine which performs better
- **Multivariate testing**: Testing multiple variables simultaneously
- **Multi-armed Bandit**: Experimentation approach that automatically optimizes for the best-performing variation
- **Identity resolution**: Connecting multiple identifiers to a single user
- **Session Replay**: Recording and playback of user interactions
- **CDP (Customer Data Platform)**: System unifying customer data from multiple sources
- **Tracking Plan**: Specification defining events and properties to collect
- **Event**: A discrete user action or system occurrence tracked in Amplitude
- **Property**: Metadata associated with events providing additional context
- **Cohort**: A group of users who share common characteristics or behaviors
- **Funnel Analysis**: Tracking user progression through a sequence of events
- **Retention Analysis**: Measuring how users continue to engage over time
