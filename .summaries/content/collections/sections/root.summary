## Product Relationships and Integration

Amplitude's product suite is designed as an integrated ecosystem where:

1. **Data** forms the foundation, collecting and managing user behavior information across platforms.

2. **Analytics** processes this data to generate insights about user behavior and product performance.

3. **Feature Experiment** and **Web Experiment** use these insights to test and optimize product experiences.

4. **Guides and Surveys** leverage behavioral data to deliver targeted in-app experiences and collect feedback.

5. **Session Replay** provides qualitative context to complement the quantitative data.

6. **CDP** ensures data quality and synchronization across the technology stack.

All products share a common data layer, allowing for seamless integration and cross-product functionality.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **SDKs (Software Development Kits)**: Implementation libraries available in four categories:
  - Analytics SDKs
  - Experiment SDKs
  - Session Replay SDKs
  - Guides and Surveys SDKs

- **Ampli CLI and Wrapper**: Tools for implementing type-safe tracking in applications

- **Client-side Implementation**: SDK integration directly in user-facing applications

- **Server-side Implementation**: SDK integration on backend servers

- **Web Experiment**: No-code experimentation tool for websites

- **Feature Flags**: Controls to enable/disable features for specific users or segments

- **Identity Resolution**: Technology to track users across devices and sessions

## Product Ecosystem Context

Amplitude positions itself as a complete product analytics and optimization platform that:

1. Connects to existing data sources and technology stacks
