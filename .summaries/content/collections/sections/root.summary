Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides behavioral analytics, customer data management, and product optimization tools for businesses to understand and improve user experiences. The platform consists of several integrated products designed to help teams make data-driven decisions without requiring extensive technical expertise.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem is built around five core products that work together seamlessly:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundation, providing behavioral analytics and AI automation capabilities for product growth insights. It includes Session Replay functionality for visual analysis of user behavior through recorded sessions, accessible via User Look-Up, Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Journeys, User Sessions, and Experiments charts.

**Amplitude Experiment** handles feature flagging, A/B testing, multivariate experiments, and Multi-armed Bandit experiments. It integrates with Web Experiment for no-code experimentation capabilities, allowing teams to run conversion optimization tests with one-line code installation.

**Amplitude Data** manages data integration across tech stacks, providing cross-device identity resolution and customer/product data management with data quality improvement tools. The platform includes a Customer Data Platform (CDP) that's natively integrated with analytics to improve data quality, discover audiences, and sync behavioral data across systems.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** replaces traditional popup components for user onboarding and feedback collection, helping improve retention, activation, and engagement metrics throughout the user journey.

The platform also provides comprehensive **Developer Tools** including SDKs for all products, APIs for programmatic access, and the Ampli CLI with code-generated Ampli Wrapper for type-safe tracking plan implementation.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Behavioral Analytics**: Analysis of user actions and interactions within digital products to understand user behavior patterns and drive product optimization decisions.

**Session Replay**: Visual recordings of user sessions that can be filtered by cohorts, events, properties, and session duration, with features like HTML element masking and support for Canvas WebGL, iFrames, and Lottie Animations.

**Feature Flagging**: Remote configuration capability that allows teams to control feature rollouts and conduct experiments without code deployments.

**Multi-armed Bandit**: An advanced experimentation method that automatically optimizes traffic allocation to the best-performing variants during an experiment.

**Autocapture Events**: Automatically tracked user interactions including Page Viewed, Element Clicked, and Element Changed events without manual instrumentation.

**Cross-device Identity Resolution**: Technology that connects user behavior across multiple devices and touchpoints to create unified user profiles.

**Ampli CLI and Wrapper**: Code-generation tools that provide type-safe tracking plan implementation with static type checking and autocomplete functionality.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates extensively with external systems through its comprehensive API ecosystem and partner network. The platform offers Analytics/Data APIs, Experiment APIs, and Guides/Surveys Translation API, all supported by robust authentication mechanisms including SCIM tokens, org API keys, and secret keys. Postman collection integration facilitates API testing and development.

The platform supports both client-side and server-side SDK implementations across multiple programming languages and frameworks, enabling flexible integration approaches based on technical requirements. The CDP component ensures seamless data synchronization across the entire technology stack, while the partner ecosystem extends functionality through third-party integrations.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

The platform provides several key API categories:
- **Analytics/Data APIs** for programmatic access to behavioral data and analytics functionality
- **Experiment APIs** for managing feature flags and experiments programmatically  
- **Guides/Surveys Translation API** for internationalization and localization of in-product messaging

Authentication is handled through multiple token types including SCIM tokens for user provisioning, org API keys for organization-level access, and secret keys for secure data transmission. The platform includes comprehensive SDK support with the Ampli CLI providing code generation capabilities for type-safe implementation.

Administrative features include billing management, account administration, single sign-on integration, and comprehensive FAQ documentation for troubleshooting across all products. The platform also provides ingestion monitoring capabilities to track data quality and identify issues like 429 throttling errors, along with session replay quota management and retention controls.
