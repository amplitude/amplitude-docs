Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides behavioral analytics, customer data management, and product optimization tools for businesses to understand and improve user experiences. The platform consists of five integrated products designed to help teams make data-driven decisions about product development and user engagement.

## Core Product Architecture

The Amplitude ecosystem is built around five primary products that work together to provide end-to-end analytics and optimization capabilities:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational behavioral analytics platform with AI automation for product growth insights. It enables teams to answer growth questions without coding skills and provides data unification across touchpoints.

**Amplitude Data** functions as the data integration layer, connecting with existing tech stacks and providing cross-device identity resolution. It focuses on improving data quality and managing both customer and product data through warehouse-native capabilities.

**Amplitude CDP (Customer Data Platform)** is natively integrated with analytics to help teams proactively improve data quality, discover new audiences, and sync behavioral data across their entire technology stack.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides comprehensive experimentation capabilities including feature flagging, A/B testing, multivariate experiments, and Multi-armed Bandit experiments. It supports both traditional experimentation and advanced optimization techniques.

**Amplitude Session Replay** enables visual analysis of user behavior through session recordings, accessible via User Look-Up, various chart types (Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Journeys, User Sessions), and homepage widgets.

## Product Relationships and Integration

The products are designed to work synergistically within the Amplitude ecosystem. Analytics serves as the data foundation that feeds into the CDP for audience discovery and data quality management. Experiment leverages analytics data for targeting and measurement, while Session Replay provides qualitative context to quantitative analytics insights. Data acts as the connective tissue, ensuring consistent data flow between products and external systems.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** are the fundamental data units representing user actions, including Autocapture events (Page Viewed, Element Clicked, Element Changed) and custom events with associated properties.

**Cohorts** are user segments based on behavioral patterns or characteristics used for filtering and targeting across the platform.

**Funnels** represent sequential user journeys through defined conversion paths, while **Journeys** provide broader user path analysis capabilities.

**Feature Flags** enable controlled feature rollouts and experimentation, while **Multi-armed Bandit** experiments provide automated optimization based on performance metrics.

**Ampli CLI** and **Ampli Wrapper** provide type-safe tracking plan implementation with static type checking and autocomplete functionality for developers.

## Technical Implementation

Amplitude provides extensive SDK support with both client-side and server-side implementation options. The SDK catalog includes Analytics SDKs, Experiment SDKs, Session Replay SDKs, and Guides/Surveys SDKs. Key technical components include:

- **Ampli CLI** for tracking plan management and code generation
- **API infrastructure** including Analytics/Data APIs, Experiment APIs, and Guides/Surveys Translation API
- **Authentication** using Amplitude keys, tokens, SCIM tokens, org API keys, and secret keys
- **Postman collection** integration for API testing and development

## Broader Product Ecosystem

Amplitude positions itself as a central hub in the modern data stack, integrating with existing technology infrastructure through its Data product. The platform connects with data warehouses, marketing tools, and other business applications to create a unified view of customer behavior. The Partners ecosystem extends functionality through third-party integrations, while the CDP enables data activation across the entire marketing and product technology stack.

## Specialized Features

**Web Experiment** provides no-code A/B testing and multivariate testing capabilities with one-line code installation, targeting capabilities, and performance optimization.

**Guides and Surveys** offers an alternative to popup components for user onboarding, feedback collection, and improving retention, activation, and engagement metrics throughout the user journey.

**Session Replay** includes advanced filtering by cohorts, events, properties, and session duration, with support for custom session definitions, account-level reporting, and HTML element masking for privacy compliance.

## Data Quality and Management

The platform emphasizes data quality through ingestion monitoring, throttling management (including 429 error handling), and comprehensive data validation. Administrative capabilities include billing management, account administration, and single sign-on integration, supported by extensive developer resources including SDK documentation, API references, and integration guides.
