Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that provides behavioral analytics, customer data management, and growth optimization tools for product teams. The platform consists of several integrated products designed to help organizations understand user behavior, run experiments, and activate data across their technology stack.

## Core Product Architecture

The Amplitude ecosystem is built around five primary product areas that work together to provide end-to-end analytics and experimentation capabilities:

**Analytics Platform** serves as the foundation, offering behavioral analytics with AI automation for product growth analysis. It includes specialized analysis tools like Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Personas, Revenue LTV, Impact Analysis, Stickiness metrics, and an Engagement Matrix. The platform features Session Replay functionality for visual user behavior analysis through recorded sessions.

**Data Management** encompasses multiple data-related products including Amplitude Data for tech stack integration and cross-device identity resolution, a Customer Data Platform (CDP) natively integrated with analytics for data quality improvement and audience discovery, and comprehensive source/destination catalogs for data connectivity.

**Experimentation Suite** includes Amplitude Experiment for feature flagging and A/B testing, Web Experiment for browser-based experimentation, and support for multivariate experiments and Multi-armed Bandit optimization approaches.

**User Engagement Tools** feature Guides and Surveys as an alternative to popup components for user onboarding, feedback collection, and improving retention, activation, and engagement metrics throughout the user journey.

**Developer Infrastructure** provides extensive SDK support for both client-side and server-side implementations, comprehensive APIs, and the Ampli CLI/Wrapper system for code-generated tracking libraries with static type checking and autocomplete functionality.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Behavioral Analytics**: Analysis of user actions and interactions within products to understand usage patterns and optimize user experience.

**Event Segmentation**: Analysis method for breaking down events by user properties, event properties, or cohorts to understand different user behaviors.

**Funnel Analysis**: Tracking user progression through defined steps to identify conversion rates and drop-off points.

**Retention Analysis**: Measurement of user return behavior over time to understand product stickiness and long-term engagement.

**Session Replay**: Visual recordings of user sessions that can be accessed through User Look-Up, various chart types, and integrated with features like Microscope for detailed analysis.

**CDP (Customer Data Platform)**: Natively integrated system for improving data quality, discovering audiences, and syncing behavioral data across technology stacks.

**Amplitude Experiment**: Feature flagging and experimentation platform supporting A/B testing, multivariate experiments, and Multi-armed Bandit approaches.

**Ampli CLI/Wrapper**: Code-generated SDK system that provides static type checking, autocomplete functionality, and structured event tracking based on Tracking Plans.

**Cross-device Identity Resolution**: Technology for connecting user behavior across multiple devices and touchpoints.

## API Endpoints and Technical Integration

The platform provides several API categories:

- **Analytics/Data APIs** for programmatic access to analytics data and configuration
- **Experiment APIs** for managing feature flags and experiment configurations  
- **Guides/Surveys Translation API** for internationalization of user engagement content
- **SCIM API** for user and group management with enterprise authentication systems

Authentication utilizes multiple token types including org_api_key, org_secret_key, and SCIM tokens. The platform integrates with Postman collections for API testing and development.

SDK implementation supports both client-side and server-side approaches across Analytics SDKs, Experiment SDKs, Session Replay SDKs, and Guides/Surveys SDKs, with the Ampli system providing code-generated tracking libraries.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude positions itself as a central hub for product intelligence that integrates with existing technology stacks through its data platform. The CDP functionality enables bidirectional data flow with data warehouses, marketing tools, and other business systems. The platform supports warehouse-native architectures and provides extensive source and destination catalogs for data connectivity.

Administrative capabilities include billing management, account administration, single sign-on integration, and partner ecosystem support. The platform serves multiple team types including product teams, growth teams, and product marketing teams with role-based access and organizational controls.

The documentation structure indicates enterprise-grade capabilities with features like PII handling, data governance controls, session replay quotas and retention policies, account-level reporting, and portfolio views for multi-product organizations.
