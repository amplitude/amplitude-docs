- Post-experiment actions for conversion optimization

### Session Replay
A qualitative analysis tool that records and plays back user sessions to:
- Provide context beyond quantitative metrics
- Enable issue troubleshooting
- Improve conversion rates
- Observe direct user interactions with timestamp correlation
- Synchronize events with specific user actions
- Search and filter capabilities for efficient analysis
- Privacy controls through element masking

### Guides and Surveys
An engagement platform that replaces traditional popup components to:
- Streamline user onboarding
- Collect product feedback
- Optimize user journeys
- Facilitate customer communication
- Improve key metrics (retention, activation, engagement)

### CDP (Customer Data Platform)
An integrated customer data platform that:
- Proactively improves data quality
- Enables audience discovery and segmentation
- Synchronizes behavioral data across technology stacks

## Product Ecosystem Relationships

Amplitude's product suite functions as an integrated ecosystem with clear relationships:

1. **Data Foundation Layer**: 
   - Data products and SDKs collect, organize, and manage user behavior data
   - CDP connects and resolves identities across platforms

2. **Analysis Layer**:
   - Analytics tools process the collected data
   - Session Replay provides qualitative context to quantitative metrics

3. **Optimization Layer**:
   - Experiment and Web Experiment enable hypothesis testing
   - Insights from analytics drive experiment design

4. **Engagement Layer**:
   - Guides and Surveys facilitate direct user interaction
   - CDP activates insights by creating targetable audiences

5. **Integration Layer**:
   - APIs connect Amplitude to external systems
   - Data synchronization enables cross-platform activation
