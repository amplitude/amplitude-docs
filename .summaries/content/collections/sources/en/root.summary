## Amplitude Sources and Data Instrumentation Platform

Amplitude Sources is a comprehensive data ingestion and instrumentation platform that enables organizations to connect third-party data sources, track user behavior, and manage data flow from various platforms into Amplitude's analytics ecosystem. The platform provides robust tools for revenue tracking, session management, user identification, and data validation across mobile and web applications.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

The Sources platform operates through several interconnected components:

**Sources Interface** serves as the central hub, featuring a Sources List tab for managing connected data sources and an Ingestion Debugger for real-time monitoring of data flow, throttled users/devices, and event volume tracking. The Catalog interface facilitates adding new third-party integrations through a streamlined Set Up Connection workflow.

**Data Instrumentation Layer** encompasses multiple tracking capabilities including revenue instrumentation with properties like `$revenue`, `$price`, and `$quantity`, session tracking with automatic ID generation and timeout configurations, and unique user identification through a three-tier ID system (device ID, user ID, Amplitude ID).

**Data Export and Validation** components handle timezone reconciliation between Amplitude charts, Snowflake/Redshift destinations, and Export API, ensuring data consistency across different output formats and time zone configurations.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Identifiers:**
- **Amplitude ID**: Automatically generated unique identifier for user tracking
- **Device ID**: Platform-specific identifier (IDFV for iOS, UUID for web, IDFA/AdID for advertising)
- **User ID**: Custom identifier assigned when anonymous users are identified
- **Session ID**: Automatically generated identifier for user session tracking

**Revenue Tracking:**
- **Revenue (Verified)**: In-app purchases validated through iTunes Connect or Google Play receipt validation
- **Revenue (Unverified)**: Revenue events without receipt validation
- **logRevenueV2**: Current revenue tracking function (logRevenue is deprecated)

**Session Management:**
- **client_event_time**: Timestamp used for session length calculations using max(client_event_time) - min(client_event_time) formula
- **server_upload_time**: Server-side timestamp used by Export API for date range filtering
- **setMinTimeBetweenSessionsMillis**: Configuration method for session timeout settings

**Data Processing:**
- **Throttled users/devices**: Users or devices with restricted data ingestion due to volume limits
- **Out-of-session events**: Events tracked outside normal session boundaries
- **Anonymous user merging**: Automatic process combining anonymous user data with identified user profiles

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Sources integrates with multiple external platforms and internal Amplitude products:

**Third-party Integrations** include Snowflake and Redshift for data warehousing, iTunes Connect and Google Play for in-app purchase verification, and various data platforms accessible through the Catalog interface.

**Internal Amplitude Products** connect through Revenue LTV charts for monetization analysis, User Sessions charts for engagement tracking, Event Segmentation charts for behavioral analysis, and Portfolio cross-project user matching for enterprise-level user tracking across multiple properties.

**Data Flow Architecture** supports both SDK-based instrumentation and HTTP API integration, with automatic timezone handling between UTC (Export API/Snowflake) and project-specific timezones (Amplitude charts).

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Key Methods and Functions:**
- `logRevenueV2()`: Revenue event tracking with verification support
- `setMinTimeBetweenSessionsMillis()`: Session timeout configuration
- `setOptOut()`: User privacy control for revenue tracking
- `trackingSessionEvents`: Boolean configuration for Start/End Session event tracking

**Configuration Options:**
- **defaultTracking.sessions**: Automatic session tracking enablement
- **iTunes Connect In App Purchase Shared Secret**: iOS receipt validation
- **Google Play License Public Key**: Android receipt validation
- **Session ID -1**: HTTP API designation for out-of-session events

**Data Access:**
- **Manager permissions**: Required access level for Sources interface management
- **30-day activity status**: Standard monitoring period for source activity
- **Redshift raw data immutability**: Ensures data integrity in warehouse exports

The platform maintains data consistency through UTC standardization in export systems while preserving project-specific timezone settings for user-facing analytics, ensuring accurate cross-platform data analysis and reporting.
