Amplitude Data Sources is a comprehensive data ingestion and management platform that enables organizations to connect, monitor, and analyze data from third-party platforms and custom implementations. The system provides robust tracking capabilities for user behavior, revenue, and session analytics while offering advanced debugging and monitoring tools for data quality assurance.

## Core Product Architecture

The Amplitude Data Sources ecosystem consists of several interconnected components:

**Data Sources Interface** serves as the central hub for managing third-party platform connections through the Sources List tab, where users can monitor ingestion status, configure source notifications, and track data flow from external systems.

**Ingestion Debugger** provides real-time monitoring capabilities for data quality, including throttled users/devices tracking, event volume analysis over 30-day and 90-day timeframes, successful/error request monitoring, and silenced device ID management.

**Export API and Data Destinations** facilitate data export to external systems like Snowflake and Redshift, with specific handling for timezone differences and data synchronization.

**Tracking SDKs and APIs** enable custom instrumentation for revenue tracking, session management, and unique user identification across web and mobile platforms.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**User Identity Management:**
- **Device ID**: Platform-specific identifier (IDFV for iOS, UUID for web)
- **User ID**: Custom identifier assigned by the application
- **Amplitude ID**: Internal identifier that enables user merging and cross-device tracking
- **Anonymous User Merging**: Automatic process linking pre-identification and post-identification user behavior

**Session Tracking:**
- **Session ID**: Unix timestamp-based identifier with platform-specific timeouts (5 minutes mobile, 30 minutes web)
- **Session Length**: Calculated as max(client_event_time) - min(client_event_time) for events within a session
- **Out-of-session Events**: Events assigned session ID -1 when occurring outside defined session boundaries
- **Start/End Session Events**: Configurable automatic events for session boundary tracking

**Revenue Tracking Properties:**
- **$revenue**: Total transaction value
- **$price**: Individual item price
- **$quantity**: Number of items
- **$productId**: Product identifier
- **$revenueType**: Transaction categorization
- **$currency**: ISO 4217 currency codes
- **Revenue Verification**: iTunes Connect Shared Secret or Google Play License Public Key validation

**Data Quality Monitoring:**
- **Throttled Users/Devices**: Rate-limited entities due to excessive event volume
- **Silenced Device IDs**: Permanently blocked devices from data ingestion
- **Manager Permissions Throttling**: Administrative controls for data ingestion limits

## Integration Ecosystem

The platform integrates with multiple external systems and services:

**Third-party Platforms** connect through the Sources interface with configurable notification systems, including Slack integration for real-time alerts about source activity and data quality issues.

**Data Warehouses** like Snowflake and Redshift receive exported data with UTC timezone standardization, while the Export API provides programmatic access using server_upload_time-based filtering rather than event_time.

**Mobile App Stores** integrate for revenue verification through iTunes Connect and Google Play services, enabling distinction between verified and unverified in-app purchase events.

**Cross-domain Tracking** enables user journey analysis across multiple web properties within the same organization through shared device identification.

## API Endpoints and Implementation

**Revenue Tracking API:**
- `logRevenueV2()` function for comprehensive revenue event logging
- HTTP API revenue fields for server-side implementation
- `setOptOut()` method for privacy compliance

**Session Management API:**
- `setMinTimeBetweenSessionsMillis()` for custom session timeout configuration
- `trackingSessionEvents` and `defaultTracking.sessions` for automatic session event generation

**Data Export:**
- Export API with UTC-based date range filtering
- Raw data exports to Redshift with immutable merged user handling

The system generates three distinct revenue event types (Revenue, Revenue (Verified), Revenue (Unverified)) that populate Revenue LTV charts, while session data feeds into User Sessions charts and Pathfinder analysis tools. Event filtering excludes hidden, inactive, and deleted events from calculations, ensuring data accuracy across all analytical outputs.
