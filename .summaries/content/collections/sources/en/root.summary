## Amplitude Sources and Data Instrumentation Platform

Amplitude Sources is a comprehensive data ingestion and instrumentation platform that enables organizations to connect third-party data platforms, track user behavior, and manage event data flow into Amplitude's analytics ecosystem. The platform provides robust tools for revenue tracking, session management, user identification, and data source connectivity with built-in debugging and monitoring capabilities.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

The Sources platform operates as the primary data entry point for Amplitude's analytics ecosystem, with several interconnected components:

**Sources Interface** serves as the central hub for managing data connections, featuring the Sources List tab for overview management and the Catalog for setting up new integrations. The **Ingestion Debugger** provides real-time monitoring of data flow, tracking throttled users/devices, monitoring event volumes, and displaying successful vs. error request metrics over 30-day activity periods.

**Revenue Tracking** integrates directly with the Sources platform through SDK implementations and HTTP API endpoints, feeding data into Revenue LTV charts. The system supports both verified and unverified revenue streams, with automatic receipt validation for mobile app purchases.

**Session Management** works in conjunction with user tracking to provide comprehensive behavioral analytics, feeding data into User Sessions charts and supporting custom session definitions across different platform types.

**User Identification System** operates across all data sources to maintain consistent user identity through device ID, user ID, and Amplitude ID relationships, enabling cross-platform user journey tracking.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Identity Concepts:**
- **Amplitude ID**: Automatically generated unique identifier for each user profile
- **Device ID**: Platform-specific identifier (IDFV for iOS, UUID for web, IDFA/AdID for advertising)
- **User ID**: Custom identifier assigned by the application for authenticated users
- **Anonymous User Merging**: Automatic process combining pre and post-authentication user data

**Revenue Tracking Properties:**
- **$revenue**: Total monetary value of the transaction
- **$price**: Individual item price
- **$quantity**: Number of items purchased
- **Revenue (Verified)**: Transactions validated through iTunes Connect or Google Play
- **Revenue (Unverified)**: Self-reported revenue without third-party validation

**Session Management:**
- **Session ID**: Unix timestamp-based identifier with platform-specific timeouts (5 minutes mobile, 30 minutes web)
- **Out-of-session events**: Events with session ID -1, occurring outside normal session boundaries
- **Session length**: Calculated as max(client_event_time) - min(client_event_time) per session

**Data Processing Terms:**
- **server_upload_time**: UTC timestamp when Amplitude receives the event
- **event_time**: Timestamp when the event actually occurred
- **client_event_time**: Local timestamp from the client device
- **Throttled users/devices**: Rate-limited entities due to excessive event volume

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Sources integrates with multiple components of the broader Amplitude ecosystem:

**Analytics Integration**: Data flows from Sources into Amplitude's core analytics products, including Event Segmentation charts, User Sessions charts, and Revenue LTV charts, with timezone handling differences between UTC (Export API/Snowflake) and project-specific timezones (Amplitude charts).

**Data Destinations**: Sources connects to enterprise data warehouses including Snowflake and Redshift destinations, with specific considerations for timezone handling and data consistency across platforms.

**Cross-Project Portfolio**: User identification system supports Portfolio functionality for cross-project user matching, enabling unified user journey tracking across multiple Amplitude projects.

**Notification Systems**: Integration with Slack for real-time alerts and notifications about source performance, errors, and data quality issues.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Revenue Tracking Implementation:**
- `logRevenueV2()` function for SDK-based revenue tracking
- HTTP API revenue fields for server-side implementation
- `setOptOut()` method for privacy compliance

**Session Management Configuration:**
- `setMinTimeBetweenSessionsMillis()` for custom session timeout configuration
- `trackingSessionEvents` parameter for Start/End Session event control
- `defaultTracking.sessions` for automatic session tracking enablement

**Data Export and Analysis:**
- Export API with UTC timezone standardization
- Date range filtering based on server_upload_time vs event_time
- Raw data access through Redshift with immutable event records

**Monitoring and Debugging:**
- 90-day time frame analysis for historical data review
- Manager permissions for throttling visibility and control
- Real-time event volume monitoring with success/error rate tracking

The platform maintains data integrity through comprehensive validation, receipt verification for mobile purchases, and automatic user profile merging while providing extensive debugging tools for data quality assurance.
