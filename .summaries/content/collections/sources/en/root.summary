## Amplitude Sources and Data Instrumentation Platform

Amplitude Sources is a comprehensive data ingestion and instrumentation platform that enables organizations to connect third-party data sources, track user behavior, and manage data flow from various platforms into Amplitude's analytics ecosystem. The platform provides both automated data collection capabilities and manual instrumentation tools for tracking specific user actions and business metrics.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

The Sources platform operates through several interconnected components:

**Sources Interface and Management**: The primary entry point is the Sources List tab, which provides visibility into all connected data sources, their 30-day activity status, and overall health monitoring. The Ingestion Debugger serves as the operational monitoring layer, tracking throttled users/devices, event volume, successful/error requests, and silenced device IDs. New integrations are managed through the Catalog interface with a Set Up Connection tab for configuration.

**Data Instrumentation Layer**: The platform supports multiple instrumentation methods including SDKs and HTTP API for tracking specific user behaviors. Revenue tracking utilizes specialized properties ($revenue, $price, $quantity) with the logRevenueV2 function, while session tracking employs automatic session ID generation using Unix timestamps with configurable timeout intervals.

**User Identity Management**: The system implements a sophisticated user tracking mechanism that combines device ID, user ID, and Amplitude ID to create unified user profiles across anonymous sessions, multiple devices, and authenticated user states.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Identifiers**:
- **Amplitude ID**: Primary user identifier generated by Amplitude for tracking users across sessions and devices
- **Device ID**: Platform-specific identifier (IDFV for iOS, UUID for web, advertising identifiers like IDFA/AdID)
- **User ID**: Custom identifier assigned by the application for authenticated users
- **Session ID**: Unix timestamp-based identifier with automatic generation and configurable timeouts

**Revenue Tracking Terminology**:
- **Revenue (Verified)**: In-app purchases validated through iTunes Connect or Google Play receipt validation
- **Revenue (Unverified)**: Revenue events without receipt validation
- **logRevenueV2**: Current revenue tracking function (logRevenue is deprecated)

**Session Management**:
- **Mobile Session Timeout**: 5-minute default inactivity threshold
- **Web Session Timeout**: 30-minute default inactivity threshold
- **Out-of-session Events**: Events with session ID -1 indicating activity outside defined session boundaries
- **Session Length Calculation**: max(client_event_time) - min(client_event_time) based on session ID property

**Data Processing Concepts**:
- **server_upload_time**: Server-side timestamp used by Export API for date range filtering
- **client_event_time**: Client-side timestamp used for session length calculations
- **event_time**: Event occurrence timestamp used in Amplitude charts
- **Throttled Users/Devices**: Rate-limited entities monitored through the Ingestion Debugger

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Sources integrates with multiple components of the broader Amplitude ecosystem:

**Data Destinations**: The platform connects with Snowflake and Redshift data destinations, though timezone handling differs (UTC for exports vs. project timezone for charts). Export API provides programmatic access to event data with server_upload_time-based filtering.

**Analytics and Visualization**: Sources data feeds into various Amplitude chart types including Event Segmentation charts, Revenue LTV charts, User Sessions charts, and Pathfinder charts. The User Sessions chart supports custom session property definitions for flexible analysis.

**Cross-Platform Capabilities**: Portfolio functionality enables cross-project user matching, while cross-domain tracking maintains user identity across different web properties. The system handles merged users scenarios and provides event ID sequencing for data integrity.

**Third-Party Integrations**: The platform supports connections with iTunes Connect for iOS in-app purchase verification, Google Play for Android receipt validation, and Segment cloud-mode connections for additional data routing capabilities.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Key Functions and Methods**:
- `logRevenueV2()`: Primary revenue tracking function with verification capabilities
- `setMinTimeBetweenSessionsMillis()`: Configure custom session timeout intervals
- `setOptOut()`: Revenue tracking opt-out functionality
- `trackingSessionEvents` and `defaultTracking.sessions`: Browser SDK session configuration

**Configuration Parameters**:
- iTunes Connect In App Purchase Shared Secret for iOS receipt validation
- Google Play License Public Key for Android verification
- Manager permissions required for Sources interface access
- Session timeout configuration for mobile (5min) and web (30min) platforms

The platform excludes hidden, inactive, and deleted events from session length calculations and provides comprehensive monitoring through the Ingestion Debugger for operational visibility into data flow and quality metrics.
