# Amplitude Data Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude Data is a comprehensive analytics platform that enables organizations to collect, process, and analyze user behavior data from various sources. The platform focuses on tracking user interactions, sessions, revenue, and unique user identification across web and mobile applications. Amplitude Data allows businesses to connect third-party data sources, track custom events, and gain insights into user behavior through specialized tracking mechanisms.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Data Sources and Integration

Amplitude Data allows integration with third-party platforms through the Sources interface, which consists of:
- **Sources List**: Displays all connected data sources with their status and event volume
- **Ingestion Debugger**: Helps troubleshoot data ingestion issues
- **Catalog**: A repository of available data source connectors

Users can connect new data sources through a step-by-step process in the Catalog, enabling data import from various third-party platforms.

### User Identification System

Amplitude uses a three-tiered identification system:
- **Device ID**: Identifies a specific device or browser
- **User ID**: Custom identifier assigned when users log in
- **Amplitude ID**: Amplitude's internal user identifier that manages the relationship between Device IDs and User IDs

This system enables tracking users across different devices and login states, with automatic user merging when Amplitude determines multiple Amplitude IDs belong to the same user.

### Session Tracking

Amplitude defines and tracks user sessions with these key concepts:
- **Session ID**: A unique identifier for each user session
- **Session Length**: Calculated as the difference between maximum and minimum client_event_time within a session
- **Timeout Behaviors**: Different timeout settings for mobile (5 minutes of inactivity) and web (30 minutes of inactivity)
- **Custom Session Definition**: Options to define sessions based on specific user behaviors

Sessions can be implemented through SDKs or the HTTP API, with options to handle out-of-session events and configure custom session properties.

### Revenue Tracking

Amplitude provides specialized tracking for revenue-generating events:
- **Revenue Properties**: Standard properties like $revenue, $price, $quantity
- **In-App Purchase Tracking**: Methods for tracking and verifying in-app purchases
- **Non-App Purchase Tracking**: Options for tracking revenue from other sources
- **Revenue Verification**: Tools to validate in-app purchases against app store receipts

### Data Export and Analysis

Amplitude offers data export capabilities with some important considerations:
- **Timezone Differences**: Amplitude analytics uses project timezone while exports (Snowflake/Redshift and Export API) use UTC
- **Time References**: Export API uses server_upload_time rather than event time
- **Data Discrepancies**: Explanations for why exported data might differ from what appears in Amplitude charts

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **client_event_time**: The timestamp when an event occurred on the client device
- **server_upload_time**: The timestamp when Amplitude servers received the event
- **Amplitude ID**: Amplitude's internal user identifier
- **Device ID**: Identifier for a specific device or browser (may be IDFA, AdID, or custom)
- **User ID**: Custom identifier typically assigned at user login
- **Session ID**: Unique identifier for a user session
- **Revenue Properties**: Special properties ($revenue, $price, $quantity) used for revenue tracking
- **Sources List**: Interface showing all connected data sources
- **Ingestion Debugger**: Tool for troubleshooting data ingestion issues
- **Catalog**: Repository of available data source connectors

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Data appears to be part of a broader Amplitude ecosystem, with connections to:
- **Amplitude Analytics**: The core analytics platform where data is visualized and analyzed
- **Snowflake/Redshift**: Data warehouse integrations for exporting and analyzing Amplitude data
- **Export API**: API for programmatically exporting data from Amplitude
- **Mobile and Web SDKs**: Client-side libraries for implementing Amplitude tracking

The platform is designed to collect data from various sources, process it according to configurable rules, and make it available for analysis both within Amplitude's native tools and through exports to other systems.

## API Endpoints and Implementation

While specific API endpoints aren't fully detailed in the provided documentation, several implementation methods are mentioned:

- **HTTP API**: Used for sending events to Amplitude, including session and revenue tracking
- **Export API**: Used for exporting data from Amplitude (uses server_upload_time and UTC timezone)
- **SDK Methods**:
  - `logRevenueV2`: Method for tracking revenue events
  - Session tracking methods for starting and ending sessions

Implementation considerations include handling user identification across devices, configuring session timeouts, validating revenue events, and ensuring proper timezone handling when analyzing exported data.
