## Amplitude Sources and Data Instrumentation Platform

Amplitude Sources is a comprehensive data ingestion and instrumentation platform that enables organizations to connect third-party data platforms, track user behavior, and manage data flow from various sources into Amplitude's analytics ecosystem. The platform provides robust tools for monitoring data quality, tracking revenue events, managing user sessions, and ensuring accurate user identification across multiple touchpoints.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

The Sources platform operates through several interconnected components:

**Sources Interface and Management**: The primary interface includes a Sources List tab for managing connected data sources and an Ingestion Debugger that provides real-time monitoring of data flow with success/error metrics, throttled users/devices tracking, and event volume analysis over 30-day and 90-day timeframes.

**Data Instrumentation Layer**: Core tracking capabilities encompass revenue tracking through specialized properties ($revenue, $price, $quantity), session management with automatic ID generation, and unique user identification using a three-tier ID system (device ID, user ID, Amplitude ID).

**Export and Data Consistency**: The platform maintains data integrity across different destinations (Snowflake, Redshift) while managing timezone differences and ensuring consistent data representation between Amplitude charts and external systems.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**User Identification System**:
- **Device ID**: Platform-specific identifiers (IDFV for iOS, UUID for web, IDFA/AdID for advertising)
- **User ID**: Custom identifier assigned when users authenticate
- **Amplitude ID**: Automatically generated unique identifier that persists across device/user ID changes

**Session Management**:
- **Session ID**: Unix timestamp-based identifier with platform-specific timeouts (5 minutes mobile, 30 minutes web)
- **Out-of-session events**: Events with session ID -1 that occur outside normal session boundaries
- **Session length**: Calculated as max(client_event_time) - min(client_event_time) per session ID

**Revenue Tracking Categories**:
- **Revenue (Verified)**: In-app purchases validated through iTunes Connect/Google Play receipt validation
- **Revenue (Unverified)**: Revenue events without receipt validation
- **Revenue properties**: $revenue, $price, $quantity for comprehensive transaction tracking

**Data Processing Terms**:
- **server_upload_time**: UTC timestamp when events reach Amplitude servers
- **client_event_time**: Local timestamp when events occur on client devices
- **Throttled users/devices**: Accounts with restricted data ingestion due to volume limits
- **Silenced device IDs**: Devices excluded from data collection

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Sources serves as the foundational data layer within Amplitude's analytics ecosystem, feeding data into downstream products like Revenue LTV charts, User Sessions charts, and Event Segmentation charts. The platform integrates with major cloud data warehouses (Snowflake, Redshift) and maintains compatibility with Amplitude's Portfolio feature for cross-project user matching.

The system supports both SDK-based implementation and HTTP API integration, providing flexibility for different technical architectures. Data flows from Sources into Amplitude's core analytics engine, where it powers various visualization and analysis tools while maintaining data lineage and quality controls.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Key SDK Methods**:
- `logRevenueV2()`: Revenue event tracking with verification capabilities
- `setMinTimeBetweenSessionsMillis()`: Custom session timeout configuration
- `setOptOut()`: Privacy control for revenue tracking
- `trackingSessionEvents`: Boolean flag for Start/End Session event generation

**HTTP API Integration**: Direct revenue tracking through HTTP API with revenue-specific fields and session management capabilities.

**Configuration Parameters**:
- `defaultTracking.sessions`: Automatic session tracking enablement
- iTunes Connect Shared Secret and Google Play License Public Key for receipt validation
- Manager permissions for throttling visibility controls

The platform maintains strict data governance with UTC standardization for exports while preserving project-specific timezone settings for chart visualization, ensuring consistency across different analytical contexts and export destinations.
