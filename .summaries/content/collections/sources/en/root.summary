## Amplitude Sources and Data Instrumentation Platform

Amplitude Sources is a comprehensive data ingestion and instrumentation platform that enables organizations to connect third-party data sources, track user behavior, and manage data flow from various platforms into Amplitude's analytics ecosystem. The platform provides both automated data collection capabilities and manual instrumentation tools for tracking specific user actions and business metrics.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

The Sources platform operates through several interconnected components:

**Sources Interface and Data Management**: The primary Sources List tab serves as the central hub for managing all connected data sources, providing visibility into ingestion status, event volumes, and connection health. The Ingestion Debugger works alongside this interface to monitor throttled users and devices, track successful and error requests, and manage silenced device IDs.

**Data Instrumentation Layer**: The platform supports multiple instrumentation methods including SDKs and HTTP API endpoints for tracking various event types. Revenue tracking capabilities integrate with in-app purchase systems through iTunes Connect and Google Play receipt validation, while session tracking provides automatic session ID generation and timeout management across mobile and web platforms.

**User Identity Management**: The system employs a sophisticated user tracking mechanism that combines device IDs, user IDs, and Amplitude IDs to create unified user profiles across anonymous sessions, multiple devices, and authenticated user states.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Identity Concepts**:
- **Amplitude ID**: Unique identifier generated by Amplitude to track users across sessions and devices
- **Device ID**: Platform-specific identifier (IDFV for iOS, UUID for web, advertising identifiers like IDFA/AdID)
- **User ID**: Custom identifier assigned by the application for authenticated users

**Session Management**:
- **Session ID**: Automatically generated identifier grouping related user events
- **Session Length**: Calculated as max(client_event_time) - min(client_event_time) based on session ID
- **Session Timeout**: Configurable period (setMinTimeBetweenSessionsMillis) determining when new sessions begin

**Revenue Tracking Properties**:
- **$revenue**: Primary revenue amount property
- **$price**: Individual item price
- **$quantity**: Number of items purchased
- **Revenue (Verified)**: In-app purchases validated through app store receipts
- **Revenue (Unverified)**: Revenue events without receipt validation

**Data Processing Concepts**:
- **server_upload_time**: UTC timestamp when Amplitude receives the event
- **client_event_time**: Local timestamp when the event occurred on the device
- **event_time**: Processed event timestamp used in Amplitude charts

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Sources integrates with multiple components of the broader Amplitude ecosystem:

**Data Destinations**: The platform connects with Snowflake and Redshift data warehouses, though timezone handling differs between these destinations (UTC) and Amplitude charts (project timezone). The Export API provides programmatic access to event data using server_upload_time for date ranges.

**Analytics and Visualization**: Sources data feeds into various Amplitude chart types including Event Segmentation charts, Revenue LTV charts, and User Sessions charts. The Portfolio feature enables cross-project user matching for enterprise analytics.

**Third-Party Integrations**: The Catalog interface facilitates connections to external data platforms, while receipt validation integrates with iTunes Connect and Google Play for revenue verification.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Key API Functions**:
- **logRevenueV2**: Primary method for tracking revenue events (replaces deprecated logRevenue)
- **setOptOut**: Method for excluding users from revenue tracking
- **trackingSessionEvents**: Configuration for Start/End Session event tracking
- **defaultTracking.sessions**: Browser SDK session configuration

**HTTP API Specifications**:
- Session ID value of -1 indicates out-of-session events
- Unix timestamp epoch format for session timing
- UTC timezone standardization for server processing

**Configuration Options**:
- **setMinTimeBetweenSessionsMillis**: Mobile session timeout configuration
- **Enrichment Plugin**: Custom session property implementation
- **Manager permissions**: Required access level for Sources interface management

The platform excludes hidden, inactive, and deleted events from session length calculations and provides 30-day activity status monitoring for all connected sources.
