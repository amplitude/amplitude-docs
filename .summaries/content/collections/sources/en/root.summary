## Amplitude Sources and Data Instrumentation Platform

Amplitude Sources is a comprehensive data ingestion and instrumentation platform that enables organizations to connect third-party data sources, track user behavior, and manage data flow from various platforms into Amplitude's analytics ecosystem. The platform provides robust tools for data source management, event tracking, and user identification across web and mobile applications.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

The Sources platform operates through several interconnected components:

**Sources Interface** serves as the central hub for data source management, featuring the Sources List tab for monitoring connected integrations and the Ingestion Debugger for real-time data flow monitoring. The Catalog interface enables users to discover and configure new data connections through the Set Up Connection tab.

**Event Tracking System** encompasses multiple specialized tracking capabilities including revenue tracking with verification, session management with platform-specific timeouts, and unique user identification through a three-tier ID system. These tracking mechanisms feed into Amplitude's broader analytics charts including Revenue LTV charts, User Sessions charts, and Pathfinder charts.

**Data Export and API Layer** provides programmatic access to tracked data through the Export API, with specific considerations for timezone handling and data consistency across different destination platforms like Snowflake and Redshift.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**User Identification System:**
- **Device ID**: Platform-specific identifier (IDFV for iOS, UUID for web, IDFA/AdID for advertising)
- **User ID**: Custom identifier assigned by the application
- **Amplitude ID**: Internal identifier that enables user profile merging and cross-session tracking

**Session Management:**
- **Session ID**: Unix timestamp-based identifier with platform-specific timeout windows
- **Mobile Sessions**: 5-minute inactivity timeout (configurable via `setMinTimeBetweenSessionsMillis`)
- **Web Sessions**: 30-minute inactivity timeout
- **Out-of-session Events**: Events with session ID -1 that occur outside normal session boundaries

**Revenue Tracking Properties:**
- **$revenue**: Total revenue amount for the transaction
- **$price**: Individual item price
- **$quantity**: Number of items purchased
- **Revenue (Verified)**: In-app purchases validated through iTunes Connect or Google Play
- **Revenue (Unverified)**: Revenue events without receipt validation

**Data Processing Terms:**
- **server_upload_time**: UTC timestamp when events reach Amplitude servers
- **client_event_time**: Local timestamp when events occur on user devices
- **event_time**: User-timezone adjusted event timestamp
- **Throttled Users/Devices**: Rate-limited entities tracked in the Ingestion Debugger

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Sources integrates with multiple external platforms and internal Amplitude products:

**Third-party Integrations** include data warehouses (Snowflake, Redshift), mobile app stores (iTunes Connect, Google Play), and analytics platforms accessible through the Catalog interface. The platform handles timezone discrepancies between UTC-based export systems and project-specific timezone settings in Amplitude charts.

**Internal Amplitude Products** benefit from Sources data including Revenue LTV charts for monetization analysis, User Sessions charts for engagement tracking, Pathfinder charts for user journey analysis, and Event Segmentation charts for behavioral analysis. The Portfolio feature enables cross-project user matching for enterprise customers.

**SDK and API Integration** supports multiple implementation methods including native mobile SDKs with `logRevenueV2` functions, browser SDKs with `defaultTracking` configurations, HTTP API endpoints for server-side implementation, and Segment cloud-mode integration with specific session ID handling.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Revenue Tracking Implementation:**
- `logRevenueV2()` function for mobile SDKs
- HTTP API revenue fields for server-side tracking
- `setOptOut()` method for privacy compliance
- iTunes Connect Shared Secret and Google Play License Public Key configuration for receipt validation

**Session Configuration:**
- `setMinTimeBetweenSessionsMillis()` for custom mobile session timeouts
- `trackingSessionEvents` configuration for Start/End Session event generation
- `defaultTracking.sessions` for browser SDK session management

**Data Access:**
- Export API with UTC timezone standardization
- Redshift raw data access with immutable event records
- Real-time monitoring through Ingestion Debugger endpoints

The platform requires Manager permissions for source configuration and provides 30-day activity status monitoring with comprehensive error tracking and silenced device ID management capabilities.
