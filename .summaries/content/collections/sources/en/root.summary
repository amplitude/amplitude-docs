# Amplitude Data Sources and Instrumentation

## Overview

Amplitude is an analytics platform that allows organizations to collect, analyze, and visualize user behavior data. The platform enables tracking of various user interactions, including sessions, revenue, and unique user identification. Amplitude Data provides capabilities to connect third-party platforms as data sources, track specific user behaviors, and export data for further analysis.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Data Sources and Integration

Amplitude Data allows connecting third-party platforms as data sources through the Sources interface, which consists of:

- **Sources List**: Displays all connected data sources with metrics on event volume and throttled users
- **Ingestion Debugger**: Helps troubleshoot data ingestion issues
- **Catalog**: Provides a collection of available source connectors for integration

Users can add new data sources through a step-by-step process in the Catalog, enabling data import from various third-party platforms.

### User Identification System

Amplitude uses a three-tiered identification system to track unique users:

1. **Device ID**: Automatically assigned to track a user on a specific device
2. **User ID**: Optional identifier set by the implementation to track logged-in users
3. **Amplitude ID**: Internally generated ID that Amplitude uses to link user activity

The platform employs user merging logic to combine multiple Amplitude IDs when it determines they belong to the same user, ensuring consistent user tracking across devices and sessions.

### Session Tracking

Amplitude defines sessions with the following characteristics:

- **Default Timeout**: 5 minutes for mobile apps, 30 minutes for web applications
- **Session ID**: Unique identifier for each session
- **Out-of-Session Events**: Marked with session ID -1
- **Session Length Calculation**: Difference between maximum and minimum client_event_time within a session

Custom session definitions can be implemented through explicit Start/End Session events or by modifying timeout behaviors.

### Revenue Tracking

Amplitude provides specialized methods for tracking revenue events with properties including:

- **$revenue**: Total revenue amount
- **$price**: Unit price of the item
- **$quantity**: Number of items purchased
- **$receipt**: Receipt data for verification (especially for in-app purchases)

The platform supports tracking both in-app purchases (with receipt validation) and non-in-app purchases, with revenue data visualized in charts like Revenue LTV.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Amplitude ID**: Internal identifier used to track unique users across devices and sessions
- **Device ID**: Identifier for a specific device or browser instance
- **User ID**: Custom identifier set by the implementation for logged-in users
- **Session ID**: Unique identifier for a user's continuous interaction period
- **client_event_time**: Timestamp when an event occurred on the client device
- **server_upload_time**: Timestamp when Amplitude servers received the event
- **Sources List**: Interface showing all connected data sources
- **Ingestion Debugger**: Tool for troubleshooting data ingestion issues
- **Catalog**: Collection of available source connectors
- **Revenue Properties**: Special properties ($revenue, $price, etc.) for tracking purchase events

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Data integrates with the broader Amplitude ecosystem in several ways:

1. **Data Collection**: Sources interface allows importing data from third-party platforms
2. **Data Export**: Export API enables exporting data to external systems like Snowflake/Redshift
3. **Analytics Platform**: Collected data feeds into Amplitude's analytics capabilities for visualization and analysis

There are important considerations when comparing data across the ecosystem:

- Timezone differences between Amplitude analytics (project timezone) and Export API/Snowflake (UTC)
- Different time references (event time vs. server_upload_time) can cause discrepancies
- Data filtering (hidden, inactive, or deleted events) affects metrics like session length

## API and Technical Details

While specific API endpoints aren't fully detailed in the provided documentation, several technical implementation aspects are mentioned:

- **Revenue Tracking Methods**: `logRevenueV2` method for tracking revenue events
- **Session Configuration**: Options to customize session timeout periods and definitions
- **User Identification**: Methods to set Device ID and User ID for proper user tracking
- **Export API**: Used to export data, with important differences in timezone handling compared to the main platform

The documentation suggests that Amplitude provides both client-side SDKs for direct instrumentation and server-side APIs for data export and integration with other systems.
