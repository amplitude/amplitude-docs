## Amplitude Sources and Data Instrumentation Platform

Amplitude Sources is a comprehensive data ingestion and instrumentation platform that enables organizations to connect third-party data sources, track user behavior, and manage data flow from various platforms into Amplitude's analytics ecosystem. The platform provides both automated data collection capabilities and manual instrumentation tools for tracking specific user actions and business metrics.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

The Sources platform operates through several interconnected components:

**Sources Interface** serves as the central hub for managing data connections, featuring a Sources List tab for monitoring active integrations and an Ingestion Debugger for real-time troubleshooting. The Catalog interface enables users to discover and configure new data sources through a streamlined Set Up Connection workflow.

**Data Instrumentation Layer** provides SDKs and HTTP API endpoints for tracking specific user behaviors including revenue events, session management, and user identification. This layer integrates directly with the Sources interface to ensure consistent data flow and validation.

**Data Export and Synchronization** maintains consistency across different data destinations (Snowflake, Redshift) and the Export API, though with specific timezone and timestamp handling differences that affect data analysis workflows.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**User Identity Management:**
- **Amplitude ID**: Automatically generated unique identifier that persists across sessions and devices
- **Device ID**: Platform-specific identifier (IDFV for iOS, UUID for web, advertising identifiers)
- **User ID**: Custom identifier assigned when users authenticate or register

**Session Tracking:**
- **Session ID**: Automatically generated identifier grouping related user actions
- **Session Length**: Calculated as max(client_event_time) - min(client_event_time) for events sharing a session ID
- **Session Timeout**: Configurable period (setMinTimeBetweenSessionsMillis) determining when new sessions begin
- **Out-of-session Events**: Events with session ID -1, not included in standard session analysis

**Revenue Tracking:**
- **$revenue**: Primary revenue property for tracking monetary transactions
- **$price and $quantity**: Granular properties for detailed transaction analysis
- **Revenue (Verified)**: In-app purchases validated through iTunes Connect or Google Play
- **Revenue (Unverified)**: Revenue events without receipt validation
- **logRevenueV2**: Current SDK function for revenue tracking (logRevenue deprecated)

**Data Processing:**
- **server_upload_time**: UTC timestamp when Amplitude receives events
- **client_event_time**: Local timestamp when events occur on user devices
- **event_time**: Processed timestamp used in Amplitude charts with project timezone
- **Throttled Users/Devices**: Accounts exceeding rate limits, monitored through Ingestion Debugger

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Sources integrates with multiple components of the broader Amplitude ecosystem:

**Analytics and Visualization**: Data flows into Event Segmentation charts, User Sessions charts, Revenue LTV charts, and Pathfinder charts, with session definitions configurable through dedicated modals for custom analysis.

**Data Destinations**: Seamless integration with Snowflake and Redshift data warehouses, though timezone handling differs from core Amplitude charts (UTC vs. project timezone).

**Cross-Project Analytics**: Portfolio functionality enables user matching across multiple Amplitude projects, though with limitations in Redshift raw data access.

**Third-Party Integrations**: Catalog interface supports connections to various external platforms, with Manager permissions required for configuration and 30-day activity status tracking.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Revenue Tracking**: logRevenueV2() function with iTunes Connect In App Purchase Shared Secret and Google Play License Public Key for receipt validation

**Session Management**: trackingSessionEvents and defaultTracking configurations for Start/End Session event automation

**User Identification**: setOptOut() method for privacy compliance and cross-domain tracking capabilities

**Data Export**: Export API with UTC timezone standardization and server_upload_time-based date ranges

**Debugging and Monitoring**: Real-time endpoint monitoring through Ingestion Debugger with successful/error request tracking and silenced device ID management

The platform maintains event ID sequencing for proper data ordering and handles user property overwriting during user merging scenarios, ensuring data integrity across complex user journey tracking implementations.
