## Amplitude Sources and Data Instrumentation Platform

Amplitude Sources is a comprehensive data ingestion and instrumentation platform that enables organizations to connect third-party data sources, track user behavior, and manage data flow from various platforms into Amplitude's analytics ecosystem. The platform provides robust tools for revenue tracking, session management, user identification, and data validation across multiple channels.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

The Sources platform operates through several interconnected components:

**Sources Interface** serves as the central hub, featuring a Sources List tab for managing connected data platforms and an Ingestion Debugger for real-time monitoring of data flow, throttled users/devices, and event volume tracking. The Catalog interface facilitates adding new data sources through a streamlined Set Up Connection process.

**Data Instrumentation Layer** encompasses three core tracking capabilities that work in tandem: revenue tracking through specialized properties and verification systems, session management with automatic ID generation and timeout configurations, and unique user identification using a three-tier ID system (device ID, user ID, Amplitude ID).

**Data Export and Validation** components ensure data consistency across different destinations, with specific handling for timezone differences between Amplitude charts, Snowflake/Redshift destinations, and Export API endpoints.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**User Identification System:**
- **Device ID**: Platform-specific identifier (IDFV for iOS, UUID for web, IDFA/AdID for advertising)
- **User ID**: Custom identifier assigned when users authenticate
- **Amplitude ID**: Automatically generated unique identifier for user profile management
- **Anonymous User Merging**: Automatic process combining anonymous and identified user profiles

**Session Management:**
- **Session ID**: Unix timestamp-based identifier with platform-specific timeouts (5 minutes mobile, 30 minutes web)
- **Out-of-session Events**: Events with session ID -1 occurring outside normal session windows
- **Session Length**: Calculated as max(client_event_time) - min(client_event_time) per session ID

**Revenue Tracking Properties:**
- **$revenue**: Primary revenue amount property
- **$price**: Individual item price
- **$quantity**: Number of items purchased
- **Revenue (Verified)**: In-app purchases validated through iTunes Connect/Google Play
- **Revenue (Unverified)**: Revenue events without receipt validation

**Data Processing Terms:**
- **server_upload_time**: UTC timestamp when events reach Amplitude servers
- **client_event_time**: Local timestamp when events occur on user devices
- **Throttled Users/Devices**: Rate-limited entities monitored through Ingestion Debugger

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Sources integrates with multiple external platforms and internal Amplitude products:

**Third-party Integrations** include Snowflake and Redshift for data warehousing, iTunes Connect and Google Play for in-app purchase verification, and various SDK implementations across mobile and web platforms.

**Internal Amplitude Products** leverage Sources data through User Sessions charts for session analysis, Revenue LTV charts for monetization tracking, Pathfinder charts for user journey visualization, and Event Segmentation charts for behavioral analysis. The platform also supports Portfolio cross-project user matching for enterprise-level user tracking.

**Data Destinations** handle timezone conversions automatically, with Snowflake and Export API using UTC while Amplitude charts respect project timezone settings.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Core SDK Methods:**
- `logRevenueV2()`: Primary revenue tracking function (replaces deprecated `logRevenue()`)
- `setMinTimeBetweenSessionsMillis()`: Custom session timeout configuration
- `setOptOut()`: Privacy compliance for revenue tracking
- `trackingSessionEvents`: Configuration for Start/End Session event generation
- `defaultTracking.sessions`: Browser SDK session tracking enablement

**HTTP API Integration** supports session tracking with custom session ID assignment and out-of-session event handling through session ID -1 designation.

**Monitoring Endpoints** provide real-time visibility into successful requests, error requests, silenced device IDs, and 30-day activity status through the Sources interface, requiring Manager permissions for full access.

The platform maintains data integrity through automatic exclusion of hidden, inactive, and deleted events from calculations while preserving raw data immutability in Redshift destinations for audit and compliance purposes.
