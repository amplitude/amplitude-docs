# Amplitude Sources: Data Instrumentation and Ingestion Platform

Amplitude Sources is a comprehensive data ingestion and instrumentation platform that serves as the primary entry point for connecting third-party data platforms, tracking user behavior, and managing event data flow into Amplitude's analytics ecosystem. The platform provides robust tools for revenue tracking, session management, user identification, and data source connectivity with built-in debugging and monitoring capabilities.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

The Sources platform operates as the foundational data layer for Amplitude's analytics ecosystem through several interconnected components:

**Sources Interface** functions as the central management hub, featuring the Sources List tab for connection oversight and the Catalog for establishing new integrations. The **Ingestion Debugger** provides real-time data flow monitoring, tracking throttled users/devices, monitoring event volumes, and displaying success versus error request metrics across 30-day activity periods.

**Revenue Tracking** integrates seamlessly through SDK implementations and HTTP API endpoints, feeding validated transaction data into Revenue LTV charts. The system distinguishes between verified revenue streams (validated through app store receipts) and unverified self-reported revenue data.

**Session Management** coordinates with user tracking systems to deliver comprehensive behavioral analytics, populating User Sessions charts while supporting custom session definitions across different platform implementations.

**User Identification System** maintains consistent identity resolution across all data sources through device ID, user ID, and Amplitude ID relationships, enabling unified cross-platform user journey analysis.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Identity Framework:**
- **Amplitude ID**: Automatically generated unique identifier for each user profile within the system
- **Device ID**: Platform-specific identifier (IDFV for iOS, UUID for web browsers, IDFA/AdID for advertising attribution)
- **User ID**: Application-defined identifier for authenticated users
- **Anonymous User Merging**: Automated process combining pre-authentication and post-authentication user data into unified profiles

**Revenue Tracking Properties:**
- **$revenue**: Total monetary transaction value
- **$price**: Individual item unit price
- **$quantity**: Number of items in the transaction
- **Revenue (Verified)**: Transactions validated through iTunes Connect or Google Play receipt verification
- **Revenue (Unverified)**: Self-reported revenue without third-party validation

**Session Management Concepts:**
- **Session ID**: Unix timestamp-based identifier with platform-specific timeout periods (5 minutes mobile, 30 minutes web)
- **Out-of-session events**: Events assigned session ID -1, occurring outside normal session boundaries
- **Session length**: Calculated as max(client_event_time) - min(client_event_time) within each session

**Data Processing Terminology:**
- **server_upload_time**: UTC timestamp marking when Amplitude receives the event
- **event_time**: Timestamp indicating when the event actually occurred
- **client_event_time**: Local timestamp from the originating client device
- **Throttled users/devices**: Rate-limited entities due to excessive event volume transmission

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Sources integrates extensively within the broader Amplitude analytics ecosystem:

**Analytics Pipeline Integration**: Data flows from Sources into core analytics products including Event Segmentation charts, User Sessions charts, and Revenue LTV charts, with timezone handling differences between UTC (Export API/Snowflake) and project-specific timezones (Amplitude charts).

**Data Warehouse Connectivity**: Sources connects to enterprise data destinations including Snowflake and Redshift, maintaining data consistency and handling timezone considerations across platforms.

**Cross-Project Portfolio**: The user identification system supports Portfolio functionality for cross-project user matching, enabling unified user journey tracking across multiple Amplitude project implementations.

**Notification Infrastructure**: Integration with Slack provides real-time alerts about source performance, data quality issues, and system errors.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Revenue Tracking Implementation:**
- `logRevenueV2()` function for SDK-based revenue event tracking
- HTTP API revenue fields for server-side implementation
- `setOptOut()` method for privacy compliance and data collection control

**Session Management Configuration:**
- `setMinTimeBetweenSessionsMillis()` for custom session timeout configuration
- `trackingSessionEvents` parameter controlling Start/End Session event generation
- `defaultTracking.sessions` for automatic session tracking enablement

**Data Export and Analysis:**
- Export API with UTC timezone standardization for consistent data retrieval
- Date range filtering capabilities based on server_upload_time versus event_time
- Raw data access through Redshift with immutable event record storage

**Monitoring and Debugging Tools:**
- 90-day historical analysis timeframe for comprehensive data review
- Manager-level permissions for throttling visibility and control mechanisms
- Real-time event volume monitoring with detailed success/error rate tracking

The platform ensures data integrity through comprehensive validation processes, mobile purchase receipt verification, and automatic user profile merging while providing extensive debugging capabilities for maintaining data quality assurance across all connected sources.
