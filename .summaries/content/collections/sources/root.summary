## Amplitude Sources: Data Ingestion and Instrumentation Platform

Amplitude Sources is a comprehensive data ingestion and instrumentation platform that enables organizations to connect third-party data sources, track user behavior, and manage data flow into Amplitude's analytics ecosystem. The platform provides robust tools for revenue tracking, session management, user identification, and data validation across mobile and web applications, serving as the foundational layer for collecting and processing behavioral analytics data.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

The Sources platform operates through several interconnected components that work together to provide end-to-end data management:

**Sources Interface** serves as the central management hub, featuring a Sources List tab for managing connected data sources and an Ingestion Debugger for real-time monitoring of data flow, throttled users/devices, and event volume tracking. The Catalog interface facilitates adding new third-party integrations through a streamlined Set Up Connection workflow.

**Data Instrumentation Layer** encompasses multiple tracking capabilities including revenue instrumentation with properties like `$revenue`, `$price`, and `$quantity`, session tracking with automatic ID generation and timeout configurations, and unique user identification through a three-tier ID system (device ID, user ID, Amplitude ID).

**Data Export and Validation** components handle timezone reconciliation between Amplitude charts, Snowflake/Redshift destinations, and Export API, ensuring data consistency across different output formats and time zone configurations.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Identifiers:**
- **Amplitude ID**: Automatically generated unique identifier for user tracking across sessions and devices
- **Device ID**: Platform-specific identifier (IDFV for iOS, UUID for web, IDFA/AdID for advertising)
- **User ID**: Custom identifier assigned when anonymous users are identified through login or registration
- **Session ID**: Automatically generated identifier for user session tracking with configurable timeout periods

**Revenue Tracking:**
- **Revenue (Verified)**: In-app purchases validated through iTunes Connect or Google Play receipt validation
- **Revenue (Unverified)**: Revenue events without receipt validation
- **logRevenueV2**: Current revenue tracking function (logRevenue is deprecated)

**Session Management:**
- **client_event_time**: Timestamp used for session length calculations using max(client_event_time) - min(client_event_time) formula
- **server_upload_time**: Server-side timestamp used by Export API for date range filtering
- **setMinTimeBetweenSessionsMillis**: Configuration method for session timeout settings

**Data Processing:**
- **Throttled users/devices**: Users or devices with restricted data ingestion due to volume limits
- **Out-of-session events**: Events tracked outside normal session boundaries
- **Anonymous user merging**: Automatic process combining anonymous user data with identified user profiles

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Sources integrates extensively with both external platforms and internal Amplitude products to create a comprehensive analytics ecosystem:

**Third-party Integrations** include Snowflake and Redshift for data warehousing, iTunes Connect and Google Play for in-app purchase verification, and various data platforms accessible through the Catalog interface for seamless data source connectivity.

**Internal Amplitude Products** connect through Revenue LTV charts for monetization analysis, User Sessions charts for engagement tracking, Event Segmentation charts for behavioral analysis, and Portfolio cross-project user matching for enterprise-level user tracking across multiple properties.

**Data Flow Architecture** supports both SDK-based instrumentation and HTTP API integration, with automatic timezone handling between UTC (Export API/Snowflake) and project-specific timezones (Amplitude charts), ensuring consistent data processing across different consumption patterns.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Key Methods and Functions:**
- `logRevenueV2()`: Revenue event tracking with verification support for in-app purchases
- `setMinTimeBetweenSessionsMillis()`: Session timeout configuration for custom session definitions
- `setOptOut()`: User privacy control for revenue tracking compliance
- `trackingSessionEvents`: Boolean configuration for Start/End Session event tracking

**Configuration Options:**
- **defaultTracking.sessions**: Automatic session tracking enablement across SDKs
- **iTunes Connect In App Purchase Shared Secret**: iOS receipt validation configuration
- **Google Play License Public Key**: Android receipt validation setup
- **Session ID -1**: HTTP API designation for out-of-session events

**Data Access and Management:**
- **Manager permissions**: Required access level for Sources interface management and configuration
- **30-day activity status**: Standard monitoring period for source activity and health
- **Redshift raw data immutability**: Ensures data integrity in warehouse exports

The platform maintains data consistency through UTC standardization in export systems while preserving project-specific timezone settings for user-facing analytics, ensuring accurate cross-platform data analysis and reporting. This dual-timezone approach enables both technical data processing and business-friendly analytics visualization within the same ecosystem.
