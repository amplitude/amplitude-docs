# Amplitude Sources: Data Instrumentation and Ingestion Platform

Amplitude Sources is a comprehensive data collection and instrumentation platform that enables organizations to track user behavior, connect third-party data sources, and manage data flow into Amplitude's analytics ecosystem. The platform combines automated data collection capabilities with manual instrumentation tools, providing real-time debugging and monitoring features for enterprise-scale analytics implementations.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Sources platform operates through three primary interconnected layers:

**Sources Management Interface** functions as the central control hub, featuring a Sources List tab for monitoring active integrations and connection health, paired with an Ingestion Debugger for real-time data flow troubleshooting. The Catalog interface enables discovery and configuration of new data sources through a guided Set Up Connection workflow, requiring Manager-level permissions for implementation.

**Data Instrumentation Layer** provides SDKs and HTTP API endpoints for granular user behavior tracking, including revenue events, session management, and user identification workflows. This layer integrates directly with the Sources interface to ensure data validation and consistent flow patterns across all connected platforms.

**Data Export and Synchronization Layer** maintains data consistency across multiple destinations including Snowflake and Redshift data warehouses, while managing the Export API. This layer handles timezone conversions and timestamp standardization, though with specific handling differences that impact cross-platform data analysis workflows.

## Core Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**User Identity Architecture:**
- **Amplitude ID**: Automatically generated persistent unique identifier that maintains continuity across sessions, devices, and platforms
- **Device ID**: Platform-specific identifier utilizing IDFV for iOS, UUID for web browsers, and advertising identifiers for mobile platforms
- **User ID**: Custom identifier assigned during user authentication or registration processes, enabling cross-device user journey tracking

**Session Management Framework:**
- **Session ID**: Automatically generated identifier that groups related user actions within defined time boundaries
- **Session Length**: Calculated as max(client_event_time) - min(client_event_time) for all events sharing a session ID
- **Session Timeout**: Configurable duration (setMinTimeBetweenSessionsMillis) that determines when new sessions begin after periods of inactivity
- **Out-of-session Events**: Events assigned session ID -1, excluded from standard session analysis but retained for custom analytics

**Revenue Tracking Taxonomy:**
- **$revenue**: Primary monetary transaction property for tracking revenue events
- **$price and $quantity**: Granular transaction properties enabling detailed product-level revenue analysis
- **Revenue (Verified)**: In-app purchases validated through iTunes Connect or Google Play receipt verification
- **Revenue (Unverified)**: Revenue events without platform receipt validation
- **logRevenueV2**: Current SDK function for revenue tracking (logRevenue marked as deprecated)

**Data Processing Timestamps:**
- **server_upload_time**: UTC timestamp marking when Amplitude servers receive events
- **client_event_time**: Local device timestamp when events occur on user devices
- **event_time**: Processed timestamp used in Amplitude visualizations, adjusted for project timezone settings
- **Throttled Users/Devices**: Accounts exceeding configured rate limits, monitored through Ingestion Debugger alerts

## Ecosystem Integration and Data Flow

Amplitude Sources integrates across multiple components of the broader Amplitude analytics ecosystem:

**Analytics and Visualization Layer**: Data flows into Event Segmentation charts, User Sessions charts, Revenue LTV charts, and Pathfinder user journey visualizations. Session definitions remain configurable through dedicated modals for custom analysis requirements.

**Data Warehouse Integration**: Seamless connectivity with Snowflake and Redshift data warehouses, though timezone handling differs from core Amplitude charts (UTC standardization vs. project timezone localization).

**Cross-Project Analytics**: Portfolio functionality enables user identity matching across multiple Amplitude projects, with limitations in Redshift raw data access for security and performance optimization.

**Third-Party Platform Connections**: Catalog interface supports automated connections to external platforms, with 30-day activity status tracking and health monitoring for all active integrations.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Revenue Tracking Implementation**: 
- `logRevenueV2()` function with iTunes Connect In App Purchase Shared Secret and Google Play License Public Key for receipt validation
- Revenue event validation and verification workflows

**Session Management APIs**:
- `trackingSessionEvents` and `defaultTracking` configurations for automated Start/End Session event generation
- Configurable session timeout and boundary detection

**User Identity Management**:
- `setOptOut()` method for privacy compliance and GDPR/CCPA adherence
- Cross-domain tracking capabilities for unified user journey analysis
- User merging and property overwriting during identity resolution

**Data Export and Monitoring**:
- Export API with UTC timezone standardization and server_upload_time-based date range filtering
- Real-time endpoint monitoring through Ingestion Debugger with successful/error request tracking
- Silenced device ID management for debugging workflow optimization

**Data Integrity Features**:
- Event ID sequencing for proper chronological data ordering
- User property handling during user merging scenarios
- Rate limiting and throttling management for high-volume implementations

The platform maintains comprehensive event validation and ensures data integrity across complex user journey tracking implementations, supporting enterprise-scale analytics requirements with real-time monitoring and debugging capabilities.
