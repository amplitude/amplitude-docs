# Amplitude Data Sources and Instrumentation

## Product Overview

Amplitude is an analytics platform for collecting, analyzing, and visualizing user behavior data. The platform enables organizations to track user interactions including sessions, revenue events, and unique user identification across devices. Amplitude Data provides robust capabilities for connecting third-party platforms as data sources, tracking specific user behaviors, and exporting data for further analysis.

## Product Relationships and Features

The Amplitude Data ecosystem consists of several interconnected components:

1. **Sources Interface** - The central hub for data source management with three main components:
   - **Sources List**: Displays all connected data sources with metrics on event volume and throttled users
   - **Ingestion Debugger**: Troubleshooting tool for data ingestion issues
   - **Catalog**: Repository of available source connectors for integration

2. **Data Collection System** - Handles the ingestion of user behavior data through:
   - Direct instrumentation via SDKs
   - Third-party platform connections
   - Custom implementations

3. **User Identification System** - A three-tiered approach to track unique users:
   - **Device ID**: Automatically assigned to track users on specific devices
   - **User ID**: Optional identifier set by implementation for logged-in users
   - **Amplitude ID**: Internal identifier that links user activity across sessions and devices

4. **Session Tracking** - Defines and manages user interaction periods with:
   - Configurable timeout settings (default: 5 minutes for mobile, 30 minutes for web)
   - Session ID assignment
   - Session length calculation based on client_event_time

5. **Revenue Tracking** - Specialized functionality for monitoring purchase events with:
   - Dedicated tracking methods (logRevenueV2)
   - Specialized properties for revenue data
   - Support for both in-app and non-in-app purchases

6. **Data Export** - Capabilities to move data to external systems through:
   - Export API
   - Integrations with data warehouses like Snowflake/Redshift

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Amplitude ID**: Internal identifier used to track unique users across devices and sessions
- **Device ID**: Identifier for a specific device or browser instance
- **User ID**: Custom identifier set by the implementation for logged-in users
- **Session ID**: Unique identifier for a user's continuous interaction period
- **client_event_time**: Timestamp when an event occurred on the client device
- **server_upload_time**: Timestamp when Amplitude servers received the event
- **Sources List**: Interface showing all connected data sources
- **Ingestion Debugger**: Tool for troubleshooting data ingestion issues
- **Catalog**: Collection of available source connectors
- **Revenue Properties**: Special properties ($revenue, $price, $quantity, $receipt) for tracking purchase events
- **User Merging Logic**: System that combines multiple Amplitude IDs when they belong to the same user

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Data serves as the foundation for the broader Amplitude analytics platform:

1. **Data Collection Layer**: The Sources interface enables importing data from various third-party platforms and custom implementations, forming the base layer of the analytics stack.

2. **Data Processing**: Once collected, data undergoes processing including:
   - User identification and merging
   - Session definition and calculation
   - Revenue tracking and validation

3. **Analytics Platform**: Processed data feeds into Amplitude's analytics capabilities for visualization and analysis, with important considerations:
   - Timezone differences between Amplitude analytics (project timezone) and Export API/Snowflake (UTC)
   - Different time references (event time vs. server_upload_time) can cause discrepancies
   - Data filtering (hidden, inactive, or deleted events) affects metrics like session length

4. **Data Export**: The Export API enables exporting data to external systems like Snowflake/Redshift for further analysis or integration with other business systems.

## Technical Implementation Details

While specific API endpoints aren't fully detailed in the documentation, several technical implementation aspects are mentioned:

- **Revenue Tracking Method**: `logRevenueV2` method for tracking revenue events
- **Session Configuration**: Options to customize session timeout periods (default 5 minutes for mobile, 30 minutes for web)
- **User Identification Methods**: Functionality to set Device ID and User ID for proper user tracking
- **Custom Session Definitions**: Can be implemented through explicit Start/End Session events or by modifying timeout behaviors
- **Receipt Validation**: Support for validating in-app purchases through receipt data

The platform provides both client-side SDKs for direct instrumentation and server-side APIs for data export and integration with other systems, allowing for flexible implementation based on organizational needs.
