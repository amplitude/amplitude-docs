# Amplitude Sources Data Instrumentation Platform

Amplitude Sources is a comprehensive data ingestion and instrumentation platform that enables organizations to connect third-party data sources, track user behavior, and manage data flow into Amplitude's analytics ecosystem. The platform provides automated data collection capabilities alongside manual instrumentation tools for tracking user actions and business metrics across web, mobile, and server environments.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

The Sources platform operates through several interconnected components that work together to provide end-to-end data management:

**Sources Interface and Data Management**: The Sources List tab serves as the central control hub for managing all connected data sources, providing real-time visibility into ingestion status, event volumes, and connection health. The Ingestion Debugger operates in tandem with this interface to monitor throttled users and devices, track successful and error requests, and manage silenced device IDs for data quality control.

**Multi-Modal Data Instrumentation**: The platform supports diverse instrumentation methods including native SDKs for mobile platforms, JavaScript SDKs for web applications, and HTTP API endpoints for server-side tracking. Revenue tracking capabilities integrate directly with app store ecosystems through iTunes Connect and Google Play receipt validation systems, while automated session tracking provides seamless session ID generation and timeout management across all supported platforms.

**Unified User Identity Resolution**: The system employs a sophisticated multi-layered user tracking mechanism that combines device IDs, user IDs, and Amplitude IDs to create unified user profiles that persist across anonymous browsing sessions, multiple devices, and authenticated user states.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Identity Framework**:
- **Amplitude ID**: System-generated unique identifier that tracks users across sessions and devices, serving as the primary key for user unification
- **Device ID**: Platform-specific identifier (IDFV for iOS, UUID for web browsers, advertising identifiers like IDFA/AdID for mobile)
- **User ID**: Application-defined custom identifier assigned for authenticated users

**Session Management Architecture**:
- **Session ID**: Automatically generated identifier that groups related user events into logical interaction sequences
- **Session Length**: Calculated as max(client_event_time) - min(client_event_time) based on session ID grouping
- **Session Timeout**: Configurable period (setMinTimeBetweenSessionsMillis) that determines when new sessions begin after user inactivity

**Revenue Tracking Properties**:
- **$revenue**: Primary revenue amount property for tracking monetary transactions
- **$price**: Individual item price for granular revenue analysis
- **$quantity**: Number of items purchased in a single transaction
- **Revenue (Verified)**: In-app purchases validated through official app store receipt verification
- **Revenue (Unverified)**: Revenue events tracked without app store receipt validation

**Temporal Data Processing**:
- **server_upload_time**: UTC timestamp marking when Amplitude receives the event
- **client_event_time**: Local device timestamp when the event originally occurred
- **event_time**: Processed event timestamp used in Amplitude charts and analytics

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Sources integrates seamlessly with multiple components of the broader Amplitude analytics ecosystem:

**Data Warehouse Destinations**: The platform provides native connectors to Snowflake and Redshift data warehouses, with important timezone handling differences where destinations use UTC while Amplitude charts respect project timezone settings. The Export API enables programmatic access to event data using server_upload_time for precise date range queries.

**Analytics and Visualization Layer**: Sources data feeds directly into Amplitude's visualization suite including Event Segmentation charts, Revenue LTV analysis, User Sessions analytics, and custom dashboard components. The Portfolio feature enables sophisticated cross-project user matching for enterprise-level analytics across multiple product lines.

**Third-Party Platform Integration**: The Catalog interface streamlines connections to external data platforms and marketing tools, while automated receipt validation integrates with iTunes Connect and Google Play for revenue verification and fraud prevention.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Primary API Methods**:
- **logRevenueV2**: Enhanced revenue tracking method that replaces the deprecated logRevenue function
- **setOptOut**: User privacy control method for excluding users from revenue tracking
- **trackingSessionEvents**: Configuration interface for Start/End Session event tracking
- **defaultTracking.sessions**: Browser SDK session management configuration

**HTTP API Specifications**:
- Session ID value of -1 designates out-of-session events for proper categorization
- Unix timestamp epoch format required for all session timing calculations
- UTC timezone standardization enforced for server-side processing consistency

**Configuration Parameters**:
- **setMinTimeBetweenSessionsMillis**: Mobile platform session timeout configuration
- **Enrichment Plugin**: Custom session property implementation framework
- **Manager permissions**: Required access level for Sources interface administration

The platform automatically excludes hidden, inactive, and deleted events from session length calculations and provides comprehensive 30-day activity status monitoring for all connected sources. Advanced features include device ID silencing for data quality management and real-time ingestion monitoring with detailed error reporting and resolution workflows.
