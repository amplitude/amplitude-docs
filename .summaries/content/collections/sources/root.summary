# Amplitude Data Sources and Instrumentation

## Overview

Amplitude is an analytics platform that tracks and analyzes user behavior across digital products. The platform collects data from various sources, tracks user sessions, revenue, and unique users, and provides tools for data export and analysis.

Key features include:
- Integration with third-party platforms through the Sources interface
- User identification and tracking across devices using a three-ID system
- Customizable session tracking for different platforms
- Revenue tracking for in-app and non-app purchases
- Data export capabilities with connections to data warehouses

## Product Relationships and Features

### Data Sources and Integration

Amplitude Data connects to third-party platforms through the Sources interface, which consists of:

1. **Sources List**: Displays all connected data sources with information about:
   - Source name and type
   - Connection status
   - Event volume
   - Number of throttled users

2. **Ingestion Debugger**: Helps troubleshoot data ingestion issues

3. **Catalog**: Provides a list of available source integrations that can be connected

The connection process involves selecting a source from the Catalog, configuring authentication and data mapping, and monitoring the data flow through the Ingestion Debugger.

### Tracking and Instrumentation

Amplitude provides several core tracking capabilities:

1. **User Tracking**:
   - Uses a three-ID system: Device ID, User ID, and Amplitude ID
   - Handles user identification across anonymous browsing, multi-device usage, and login states
   - Performs automatic user merging when multiple Amplitude IDs belong to the same user
   - Supports cross-domain tracking

2. **Session Tracking**:
   - Defines sessions differently for mobile and web applications
   - Generates session IDs based on platform-specific rules
   - Allows custom session definitions based on properties, events, or timeout intervals
   - Supports Start/End Session events
   - Calculates session length as the difference between maximum and minimum client_event_time within a session

3. **Revenue Tracking**:
   - Tracks revenue through specific properties ($revenue, $price, $quantity)
   - Supports both in-app and non-in-app purchase tracking
   - Provides revenue verification for in-app purchases
   - Displays revenue data in the Revenue LTV chart

### Data Export and Analysis

Amplitude offers data export capabilities with some important considerations:

- Data exported through the Export API or to Snowflake/Redshift may show discrepancies compared to the Amplitude analytics platform
- These discrepancies are primarily due to:
  - Timezone differences (Amplitude uses project timezone while Snowflake and Export API use UTC)
  - Different time references (Export API uses server_upload_time rather than event time)

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Amplitude ID**: A unique identifier assigned by Amplitude to track users across devices and sessions

2. **Device ID**: A unique identifier for a specific device or browser instance

3. **User ID**: A custom identifier set by the application to identify logged-in users

4. **Session ID**: A unique identifier for a user's session, generated based on platform-specific rules

5. **client_event_time**: The timestamp when an event occurred on the client device

6. **server_upload_time**: The timestamp when an event was received by Amplitude servers

7. **Revenue Properties**:
   - $revenue: Total revenue amount
   - $price: Price of the item
   - $quantity: Number of items purchased
   - $receipt: Receipt data for verification
   - $receipt_sig: Receipt signature for verification

8. **Sources List**: Interface showing all connected data sources in Amplitude Data

9. **Ingestion Debugger**: Tool for troubleshooting data ingestion issues

10. **Catalog**: List of available source integrations that can be connected to Amplitude

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude consists of several interconnected components:

1. **Amplitude Data**: The data collection and integration platform that connects to various sources

2. **Amplitude Analytics**: The core analytics platform that processes and visualizes the collected data

3. **Export API**: Allows exporting data from Amplitude to other systems

4. **Data Warehouse Integrations**: Connections to Snowflake and Redshift for advanced data analysis

The platform collects data from multiple sources, processes it according to configured rules for user identification and session tracking, and makes it available for analysis both within Amplitude and through exports to other systems.

## API Endpoints and Commands

The following API endpoints and methods are mentioned:

1. **Export API**: Used to export data from Amplitude, with data referenced by server_upload_time

2. **SDK Methods**:
   - `logRevenueV2`: Used for tracking revenue events
   - `setOptOut`: Used to opt users out of tracking

3. **HTTP API**: Can be used as an alternative to SDKs for implementing session tracking

4. **Revenue Verification API**: Used for validating in-app purchases

Amplitude provides both client-side SDKs and server-side APIs for data collection and management, allowing flexible implementation based on specific use cases.
