## Amplitude Sources: Data Instrumentation and Integration Platform

Amplitude Sources is a comprehensive data ingestion and instrumentation platform that enables organizations to connect third-party data sources, track user behavior, and manage data flow into Amplitude's analytics ecosystem. The platform serves as the central data collection hub, providing robust tools for event tracking, user identification, revenue monitoring, and session management across web and mobile applications.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

The Sources platform operates through several interconnected components that form a cohesive data management ecosystem:

**Sources Interface** functions as the central command center, featuring the Sources List tab for monitoring connected integrations and the Ingestion Debugger for real-time data flow analysis. The Catalog interface enables discovery and configuration of new data connections through the Set Up Connection tab, creating a seamless onboarding experience for new data sources.

**Event Tracking System** encompasses specialized tracking capabilities including revenue tracking with receipt verification, session management with platform-specific timeout configurations, and comprehensive user identification through a three-tier ID system. These tracking mechanisms directly feed Amplitude's analytics charts including Revenue LTV charts, User Sessions charts, and Pathfinder charts.

**Data Export and API Layer** provides programmatic access to collected data through the Export API, handling timezone standardization and ensuring data consistency across destination platforms like Snowflake and Redshift. This layer bridges the gap between data collection and external analytics workflows.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**User Identification Hierarchy:**
- **Device ID**: Platform-specific identifier (IDFV for iOS, UUID for web browsers, IDFA/AdID for advertising attribution)
- **User ID**: Application-assigned custom identifier for authenticated users
- **Amplitude ID**: Internal identifier enabling user profile merging and cross-session tracking continuity

**Session Management Framework:**
- **Session ID**: Unix timestamp-based identifier with platform-specific inactivity thresholds
- **Mobile Sessions**: Default 5-minute inactivity timeout (configurable via `setMinTimeBetweenSessionsMillis`)
- **Web Sessions**: Standard 30-minute inactivity timeout
- **Out-of-session Events**: Events assigned session ID -1, occurring outside normal session boundaries

**Revenue Tracking Properties:**
- **$revenue**: Total transaction revenue amount
- **$price**: Individual item unit price
- **$quantity**: Number of items in transaction
- **Revenue (Verified)**: In-app purchases validated through iTunes Connect or Google Play receipt verification
- **Revenue (Unverified)**: Revenue events without platform receipt validation

**Data Processing Timestamps:**
- **server_upload_time**: UTC timestamp when events reach Amplitude servers
- **client_event_time**: Local device timestamp when events occur
- **event_time**: Project timezone-adjusted event timestamp for chart display
- **Throttled Users/Devices**: Rate-limited entities monitored in the Ingestion Debugger

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Sources integrates extensively with both external platforms and internal Amplitude products:

**External Platform Integrations** encompass data warehouses (Snowflake, Redshift), mobile app stores (iTunes Connect, Google Play), and third-party analytics platforms accessible through the Catalog interface. The platform manages timezone discrepancies between UTC-based export systems and project-specific timezone configurations in Amplitude charts.

**Internal Amplitude Product Integration** includes Revenue LTV charts for monetization analysis, User Sessions charts for engagement tracking, Pathfinder charts for user journey mapping, and Event Segmentation charts for behavioral analysis. The Portfolio feature enables cross-project user matching for enterprise customers managing multiple products.

**SDK and Implementation Support** spans native mobile SDKs, browser SDKs with `defaultTracking` configurations, HTTP API endpoints for server-side implementation, and Segment cloud-mode integration with specialized session ID handling for third-party data routing.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Revenue Tracking Implementation:**
- `logRevenueV2()` function for mobile SDK revenue events
- HTTP API revenue fields for server-side transaction tracking
- `setOptOut()` method for privacy compliance and data collection control
- iTunes Connect Shared Secret and Google Play License Public Key configuration for receipt validation

**Session Configuration Methods:**
- `setMinTimeBetweenSessionsMillis()` for custom mobile session timeout configuration
- `trackingSessionEvents` setting for Start/End Session event generation control
- `defaultTracking.sessions` configuration for browser SDK session management

**Data Access and Monitoring:**
- Export API with standardized UTC timezone formatting
- Redshift raw data access providing immutable event record storage
- Real-time data flow monitoring through Ingestion Debugger endpoints
- Throttling and error tracking for data quality assurance

**Administrative Controls:**
- Manager-level permissions required for source configuration and management
- 30-day activity status monitoring with comprehensive error tracking
- Silenced device ID management for filtering test and development traffic
- Cross-project user matching through Portfolio feature for enterprise accounts

The platform maintains data integrity through comprehensive validation, provides real-time monitoring capabilities, and ensures seamless integration with Amplitude's broader analytics and user behavior tracking ecosystem.
