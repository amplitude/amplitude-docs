# Amplitude Sources Data Instrumentation Platform

Amplitude Sources is a comprehensive data ingestion and instrumentation platform that enables organizations to connect third-party data sources, track user behavior, and manage data flow into Amplitude's analytics ecosystem. The platform provides automated data collection capabilities alongside manual instrumentation tools for tracking user actions and business metrics across web, mobile, and server environments.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Sources platform operates through several interconnected layers that work together to provide end-to-end data management:

**Sources Management Interface**: The primary operational hub centers around the Sources List tab, providing visibility into all connected data sources with 30-day activity monitoring and health status tracking. The Catalog interface manages new integrations through a Set Up Connection workflow, while the Ingestion Debugger serves as the real-time monitoring layer for tracking throttled users/devices, event volumes, request success/error rates, and silenced device management.

**Multi-Modal Data Instrumentation**: The platform supports diverse instrumentation approaches including native SDKs for mobile and web platforms, HTTP API for server-side tracking, and third-party integrations. Specialized tracking capabilities include revenue instrumentation using the `logRevenueV2()` function with properties like `$revenue`, `$price`, and `$quantity`, and session management with automatic session ID generation using Unix timestamps and configurable timeout intervals.

**Identity Resolution System**: A sophisticated user tracking mechanism combines Device ID, User ID, and Amplitude ID to create unified user profiles that persist across anonymous sessions, multiple devices, and authenticated states. This enables cross-platform user journey analysis and portfolio-level user matching across projects.

## Core Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Identity Management**:
- **Amplitude ID**: Primary system-generated user identifier for tracking across sessions and devices
- **Device ID**: Platform-specific identifier (IDFV for iOS, UUID for web, advertising identifiers IDFA/AdID)
- **User ID**: Application-defined identifier for authenticated users
- **Session ID**: Unix timestamp-based identifier with automatic generation and configurable timeout thresholds

**Revenue Tracking Classifications**:
- **Revenue (Verified)**: In-app purchases validated through iTunes Connect or Google Play receipt verification
- **Revenue (Unverified)**: Revenue events without platform receipt validation
- **logRevenueV2**: Current revenue tracking implementation (supersedes deprecated logRevenue)

**Session Management Concepts**:
- **Mobile Session Timeout**: 5-minute default inactivity threshold
- **Web Session Timeout**: 30-minute default inactivity threshold  
- **Out-of-session Events**: Events with session ID -1 indicating activity outside defined session boundaries
- **Session Length Calculation**: Computed as max(client_event_time) - min(client_event_time) within session scope

**Temporal Data Processing**:
- **server_upload_time**: Server-side timestamp used by Export API for date range filtering
- **client_event_time**: Client-side timestamp for session length calculations
- **event_time**: Event occurrence timestamp used in Amplitude visualization charts
- **Throttled Users/Devices**: Rate-limited entities monitored through Ingestion Debugger

## Ecosystem Integration and Data Flow

Amplitude Sources integrates deeply with the broader Amplitude analytics ecosystem through multiple touchpoints:

**Data Destinations and Export**: The platform connects with enterprise data warehouses including Snowflake and Redshift, handling timezone differences between UTC exports and project timezone chart displays. The Export API provides programmatic access to event data with server_upload_time-based filtering for downstream data processing.

**Analytics and Visualization Layer**: Sources data feeds directly into Amplitude's chart ecosystem including Event Segmentation charts, Revenue LTV analysis, User Sessions charts, and Pathfinder user journey visualization. The User Sessions chart supports custom session property definitions for flexible behavioral analysis.

**Cross-Platform and Portfolio Capabilities**: Portfolio functionality enables user matching across multiple projects, while cross-domain tracking maintains user identity across different web properties. The system handles merged user scenarios and provides event ID sequencing for data integrity and deduplication.

**Third-Party Platform Integrations**: Native integrations include iTunes Connect for iOS in-app purchase verification, Google Play for Android receipt validation, and Segment cloud-mode connections for additional data routing. The platform also supports custom integrations through the Catalog interface.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Core Functions and Methods**:
- `logRevenueV2()`: Primary revenue tracking function with receipt verification capabilities
- `setMinTimeBetweenSessionsMillis()`: Configure custom session timeout intervals beyond platform defaults
- `setOptOut()`: Revenue tracking opt-out functionality for privacy compliance
- `trackingSessionEvents` and `defaultTracking.sessions`: Browser SDK session configuration parameters

**Configuration and Access Control**:
- iTunes Connect In App Purchase Shared Secret for iOS receipt validation
- Google Play License Public Key for Android verification workflows
- Manager-level permissions required for Sources interface access and configuration
- Session timeout configuration supporting mobile (5min default) and web (30min default) platforms

**Operational Monitoring**: The Ingestion Debugger provides real-time visibility into data quality metrics, excluding hidden, inactive, and deleted events from session calculations while monitoring throttling, error rates, and overall data flow health across all connected sources.
