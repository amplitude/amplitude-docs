## Amplitude Sources: Data Instrumentation and Ingestion Platform

Amplitude Sources is a comprehensive data ingestion and instrumentation platform that serves as the foundational data layer for Amplitude's analytics ecosystem. The platform enables organizations to connect third-party data sources, implement robust user behavior tracking, and manage data flow from multiple touchpoints into Amplitude's analytics infrastructure. Core capabilities include real-time data quality monitoring, sophisticated revenue event tracking, automated session management, and multi-tier user identification systems that ensure accurate data attribution across complex user journeys.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Sources platform operates through several tightly integrated components that work together to provide end-to-end data management:

**Sources Management Interface** consists of a Sources List tab for configuring and monitoring connected data sources, paired with an Ingestion Debugger that provides real-time visibility into data flow performance. The debugger tracks success/error metrics, monitors throttled users and devices, and analyzes event volume patterns across 30-day and 90-day timeframes.

**Data Instrumentation Layer** forms the core tracking infrastructure with three primary subsystems: revenue tracking through specialized event properties, session management with automatic ID generation and timeout handling, and user identification through a hierarchical ID system that maintains user continuity across devices and authentication states.

**Export and Data Consistency Engine** ensures data integrity when flowing to external destinations like Snowflake and Redshift, managing timezone conversions and maintaining consistent data representation between Amplitude's internal charts and external analytical systems.

## Core Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**User Identification Hierarchy**:
- **Device ID**: Platform-specific identifiers including IDFV (iOS), UUID (web), and IDFA/AdID (advertising platforms)
- **User ID**: Custom identifier assigned during user authentication or registration
- **Amplitude ID**: Automatically generated persistent identifier that maintains user continuity across device changes and user ID modifications

**Session Management Framework**:
- **Session ID**: Unix timestamp-based identifier with platform-specific timeout configurations (5 minutes for mobile, 30 minutes for web)
- **Out-of-session events**: Events assigned session ID -1 that occur outside normal session boundaries
- **Session length**: Calculated as the time difference between maximum and minimum client_event_time values within a single session ID

**Revenue Tracking Classifications**:
- **Revenue (Verified)**: In-app purchases validated through iTunes Connect or Google Play receipt validation systems
- **Revenue (Unverified)**: Revenue events without platform receipt validation
- **Revenue properties**: Core transaction fields including $revenue (total amount), $price (unit price), and $quantity (number of units)

**Data Processing Timestamps**:
- **server_upload_time**: UTC timestamp marking when events reach Amplitude servers
- **client_event_time**: Local device timestamp when events are generated
- **Throttled users/devices**: Accounts with restricted data ingestion due to volume limit enforcement
- **Silenced device IDs**: Devices explicitly excluded from data collection processes

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Sources functions as the primary data ingestion gateway that feeds Amplitude's entire analytics ecosystem. Data processed through Sources powers downstream analytical products including Revenue LTV charts, User Sessions analytics, Event Segmentation tools, and cross-project user matching through the Portfolio feature.

The platform maintains bidirectional integration with major cloud data warehouses (Snowflake, Redshift) and supports both SDK-based implementation for native applications and HTTP API integration for server-side tracking. This architectural flexibility enables organizations to implement comprehensive tracking across web, mobile, and backend systems while maintaining data consistency and quality controls.

Sources also integrates with Amplitude's data governance framework, providing throttling controls for high-volume accounts, privacy controls for sensitive data, and data lineage tracking that maintains audit trails from initial ingestion through final analytical output.

## API Endpoints and Implementation Methods

**Core SDK Methods**:
- `logRevenueV2()`: Advanced revenue event tracking with built-in receipt verification capabilities
- `setMinTimeBetweenSessionsMillis()`: Custom session timeout configuration for application-specific user behavior patterns
- `setOptOut()`: Privacy control mechanism for revenue tracking compliance
- `trackingSessionEvents`: Boolean configuration flag controlling automatic Start/End Session event generation

**HTTP API Integration**: Direct server-side revenue tracking through RESTful endpoints supporting revenue-specific fields, session management, and bulk event processing capabilities.

**Configuration Parameters**:
- `defaultTracking.sessions`: Enables automatic session tracking and management
- iTunes Connect Shared Secret: Required for iOS in-app purchase receipt validation
- Google Play License Public Key: Required for Android in-app purchase verification
- Manager permissions: Controls visibility and access to throttling and data quality metrics

**Data Export Standards**: The platform enforces UTC standardization for all data exports while preserving project-specific timezone settings for chart visualization, ensuring analytical consistency across different export destinations and maintaining compatibility with existing business intelligence workflows.
