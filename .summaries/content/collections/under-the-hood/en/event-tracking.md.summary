**Summary:** This documentation covers Amplitude Experiment's event tracking system using assignment events (`[Experiment] Assignment`) and exposure events (`$exposure`/`[Experiment] Exposure`) for experiment analysis, including automatic tracking via remote evaluation (`fetch()`) and local evaluation (`evaluate()`), experiment user properties format (`[Experiment] <flag_key>`), and SDK integrations for client-side exposure tracking.
