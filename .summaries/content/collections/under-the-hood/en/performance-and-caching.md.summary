**Summary:** This documentation covers Amplitude Experiment's performance metrics and CDN caching behavior for both remote and local evaluation modes, including latency benchmarks across geographic regions, cache hit/miss performance data, TTL settings, cache invalidation rules, and dynamic targeting considerations for user properties and behavioral cohorts.
