**Summary:** Documents Amplitude Experiment's deterministic randomization algorithm using murmur3 hash of "bucketingSalt/amplitude_id" for two-stage user assignment: first determining experiment inclusion via mod 100 against percentage rollout, then variant assignment via floor division with weighted ranges 0-42949672.
