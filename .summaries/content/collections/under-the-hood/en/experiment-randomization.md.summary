# Summary
Amplitude Experiment uses deterministic randomization through a two-stage process: first determining if a user is included in an experiment using `mod(murmur3_x86_32("bucketingSalt/id"), 100)`, then assigning variants to included users based on `floor(murmur3_x86_32("bucketingSalt/id"), 100)` and variant weights, with the bucketing key (typically Amplitude ID) and bucketing salt as inputs.
