**Summary:** This documentation explains Amplitude Experiment's sequential testing methodology using mixture sequential probability ratio test (mSPRT) for statistical inference in A/B testing, allowing valid results at any viewing time without predetermined sample sizes and enabling early experiment termination based on ongoing observations.
