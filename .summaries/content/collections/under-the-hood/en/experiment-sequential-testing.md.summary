**Summary:** This documentation explains how Amplitude Experiment uses mixture sequential probability ratio test (mSPRT) for statistical inference in A/B testing, allowing early experiment termination without predetermined sample sizes and providing valid results at any viewing time, contrasting with traditional T-tests.
