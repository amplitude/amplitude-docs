**Summary:** This documentation explains how Amplitude Experiment uses sequential testing (specifically mixture sequential probability ratio test - mSPRT) for statistical inference in A/B testing, allowing early experiment termination and faster experimentation compared to traditional T-tests through hypothesis testing of null vs alternative hypotheses.
