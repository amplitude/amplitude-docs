# Summary
This documentation explains flag dependencies in Amplitude Experiment, which define relationships between flags to control evaluation order, implementing three key features: flag prerequisites (for complex feature releases), mutual exclusion groups (ensuring only one experiment runs per user), and holdout groups (withholding traffic to measure combined experiment impact).
