# Summary
This documentation explains flag dependencies in Amplitude Experiment, which define relationships between flags to control evaluation order, supporting three key implementations: flag prerequisites (for complex feature releases), mutual exclusion groups (ensuring only one experiment runs), and holdout groups (withholding traffic to measure combined experiment impact).
