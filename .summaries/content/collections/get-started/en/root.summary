Amplitude is a comprehensive event-based product analytics platform designed to help businesses understand user behavior, optimize engagement, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform centers around tracking discrete user actions (events) with associated metadata (event properties) and user characteristics (user properties) to provide deep behavioral analytics.

## Core Product Architecture and Features

Amplitude's analytics ecosystem is built around several key components:

**Analytics Dashboard and Visualization**: The Amplitude Home page serves as the central hub, providing real-time event streams, quick chart creation via Event Segmentation, template galleries, and product overview metrics. Users can create unlimited charts (with Starter plan limitations of 10 charts and 1-year data queries) through the Create > Chart workflow, with export capabilities to PNG, PDF, and CSV formats.

**Spaces and Content Organization**: Amplitude provides Spaces for organizing analytics content, with personal workspaces and shared collaboration spaces. Plan restrictions apply (Starter: 1 space, Plus: 3 spaces, unlimited for other plans), enabling team-based analytics workflows.

**Template System**: Pre-built analysis templates are available through the Template Gallery, including specialized reports for Feature Adoption, User Activity, Conversion Rate analysis, Ecommerce, and Acquisition Channel analysis. Templates can be converted to customizable dashboards for ongoing use.

## Data Collection and Instrumentation

**SDK Implementation**: Amplitude supports cross-platform data collection through Browser SDK (2.10.0+), iOS Swift SDK, and Android Kotlin SDK. The Browser SDK requires JavaScript snippet installation with configurable Session Replay and Autocapture features, initialized with project-specific API keys.

**Autocapture Functionality**: Automatic event tracking includes page views, element clicks, form interactions (started/submitted), session management, and marketing attribution via UTM parameters. The elementInteractions configuration enables visual labeling and comprehensive user interaction tracking.

**Data Ingestion Methods**: Multiple ingestion pathways include client-side SDKs, HTTP API v2, Identify API for user properties, third-party integrations, and various specialized APIs (Dashboard REST API, Export API, Attribution API, Behavioral Cohorts API).

## User Identification and Session Management

**Multi-layered User Tracking**: Amplitude employs a sophisticated user identification system using Device IDs, Amplitude IDs, and User IDs. Device IDs utilize platform-specific identifiers (IDFV for iOS, Advertising Identifier), while User IDs enable cross-device event reconciliation through backend data merging.

**Session Handling**: Sessions have platform-specific timeout intervals (5 minutes for mobile, 30 minutes for web) with Session IDs generated as milliseconds since epoch UTC. The platform handles anonymous-to-identified user transitions through event reconciliation.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events and Properties**: Events represent discrete user actions following verb+noun naming conventions, limited to 20 properties maximum. Event properties provide contextual metadata, while user properties define user characteristics. The platform distinguishes between active events and inactive events for analysis purposes.

**User Metrics**: Core metrics include Monthly Tracked Users (MTU), active users, retention rates, and stickiness measurements. The platform automatically tracks properties like Event Day of Week, Event Historical Count, and Session Replay ID.

**Behavioral Analysis**: Key concepts include behavioral cohorts, funnels, retention analysis, lifecycle tracking, and engagement matrices for comprehensive user journey analysis.

## Analytics Capabilities and Use Cases

**Industry-Specific Templates**: Specialized event taxonomies and templates for ecommerce (Page View, Viewing Item, Adding to Cart, Completing Purchase), B2B/SaaS (trial conversion, revenue LTV tracking), gaming, healthcare, finance, and media sectors.

**A/B Testing Integration**: Built-in AB Test View for analyzing experiment results using user properties to associate users with variations, supporting both per-experiment and unified property strategies with integration capabilities for platforms like Optimizely.

**Conversion and Retention Analysis**: Comprehensive funnel analysis, conversion rate tracking, drop-off behavior identification, and retention measurement across user cohorts and time periods.

## Technical Implementation and APIs

**API Endpoints**: The platform provides HTTP API v2 for server-side data ingestion, Identify API for user property updates, and specialized endpoints for dashboard management, data export, and behavioral cohort analysis.

**Data Quality and Deduplication**: Amplitude implements deduplication logic using event ID, client event time, and device ID matching, with 7-day insert_id retention for HTTP API submissions to prevent duplicate event processing.

**Privacy and Compliance**: Built-in consent management features including deferInitialization options, GDPR/CNIL compliance capabilities, opt-out mechanisms (setOptOut()), and configurable cookie management with AMP_ prefixed first-party cookies.

## Workflow Optimization

**Six-Step Analytics Workflow**: Amplitude promotes a structured approach including critical event identification, usage interval determination, retention analysis, lifecycle graphing, persona mapping, engagement matrix analysis, followed by cohort comparison and A/B testing.

**Implementation Team Structure**: Recommended team organization includes Project Lead (adoption coordination), Data Governor (tracking plan design), and Instrumentation Lead (SDK implementation and validation), supported by Success Manager coordination.

The platform integrates seamlessly into broader product development workflows, supporting both cross-platform unified tracking and separate platform instrumentation strategies depending on user crossover analysis needs and platform-specific behavioral requirements.
