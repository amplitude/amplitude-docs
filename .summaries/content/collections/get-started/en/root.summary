Amplitude is a comprehensive event-based product analytics platform designed to help businesses understand user behavior, optimize engagement, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform provides real-time tracking, analysis, and visualization of user interactions across web, mobile, and cross-platform applications.

## Core Product Architecture and Features

Amplitude's analytics ecosystem centers around several key components:

**Analytics Dashboard and Home Page**: The Amplitude Home page serves as the central hub, providing product overview metrics, real-time event streams, quick chart creation via Event Segmentation, and access to the template gallery for pre-built dashboard templates.

**Spaces and Content Organization**: Amplitude uses Spaces for organizing and collaborating on analytics content, with personal workspaces and shared spaces supporting team collaboration. Plan restrictions apply (Starter: 1 space, Plus: 3 spaces, unlimited for other plans).

**Template Gallery**: Pre-built analysis templates including Feature Adoption Reports, Conversion Reports, User Activity Reports, and Ecommerce Reports that can be converted to customizable dashboards.

**Chart Creation and Visualization**: Comprehensive charting capabilities with plan-specific limitations (Starter plans limited to 10 charts and 1-year data queries), supporting various export formats (PNG, PDF, CSV) and integration with notebooks.

## Data Collection and Instrumentation

**SDK Integration**: Multiple SDK options including Browser SDK (2.10.0+), iOS Swift SDK, and Android Kotlin SDK with support for automatic tracking features.

**Autocapture Functionality**: Automatic event tracking including Page viewed, Element clicked, Form submitted, Application lifecycle events, and Screen viewed events with visual labeling capabilities.

**API Endpoints**: Multiple API options including:
- HTTP API v2 for server-side data ingestion
- Identify API for user properties
- Dashboard REST API
- Export API for JSON files
- Attribution API for campaigns
- Behavioral Cohorts API

**JavaScript Snippet Implementation**: Browser-based tracking through amplitude.init() statements with API key configuration and head tag implementation.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**User Identification System**:
- **Amplitude ID**: Platform-generated unique identifier
- **Device ID**: Device-specific identifier (IDFV for iOS, Advertising Identifier)
- **User ID**: Custom identifier assigned by developers for cross-device tracking

**Event Tracking**:
- **Events**: User actions tracked with verb+noun naming conventions
- **Event Properties**: Contextual data associated with events (maximum 20 properties per event)
- **User Properties**: Persistent characteristics of users
- **Inactive Events**: Events that don't count toward active user metrics

**Session Management**:
- **Session Timeout**: 5 minutes for mobile, 30 minutes for web
- **Session ID**: Milliseconds since epoch UTC
- **Monthly Tracked Users (MTU)**: Billing metric for unique users per month

**Analytics Concepts**:
- **Behavioral Cohorts**: User groups based on shared behaviors
- **Retention**: User return patterns over time
- **Stickiness**: Frequency of user engagement
- **Funnels**: Sequential user flow analysis

## Product Ecosystem Integration

**Cross-Platform vs Separate Platform Strategy**: Organizations can choose between unified cross-platform instrumentation (same API key across iOS, Android, web) or separate platform tracking based on user crossover analysis needs and platform-specific behaviors.

**Project Organization**: Projects are created within organizations through Settings > Organization settings > Projects, with API key generation for different platforms and user role assignments.

**Data Storage and Compliance**: Configurable data storage regions (US/EU) with EU-US Data Privacy Framework compliance, GDPR support, and consent management capabilities.

**Third-Party Integrations**: Support for various data sources including CSV uploads, Chrome extensions, web bookmarklets, and integrations with platforms like Optimizely for A/B testing.

## Implementation Workflow and Team Structure

**Team Roles**:
- **Project Lead**: Coordinates with Success Manager and drives adoption
- **Data Governor**: Designs tracking plans and maintains data quality
- **Instrumentation Lead**: Implements SDK events and validates data sources

**Implementation Process**:
1. Pre-instrumentation planning with business goals definition
2. Event taxonomy planning using spreadsheet templates
3. User identification strategy
4. SDK/API implementation
5. QA through User Activity tab for real-time verification
6. Template utilization for common analytics use cases

**Analytics Workflow**: 6-step optimization process including critical event identification, usage interval determination, retention analysis, lifecycle graphing, persona mapping, and engagement matrix analysis.

## Browser Compatibility and Technical Requirements

Amplitude supports browsers with >0.5% market share, explicitly excluding Internet Explorer 11. The platform includes Content Security Policy (CSP) support and handles cookie management with AMP_ prefixed cookies and various storage configuration options.

The platform provides comprehensive deduplication logic using event ID/client event time/device ID matching with 7-day insert_id retention for HTTP API, ensuring data quality and preventing duplicate event tracking.
