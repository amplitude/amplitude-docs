Amplitude is a comprehensive event-based product analytics platform designed to help businesses understand user behavior, optimize engagement, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform enables organizations to track, analyze, and act on user interactions across web, mobile, and other digital touchpoints.

## Core Product Architecture and Features

Amplitude's analytics platform centers around event-based tracking, where user interactions are captured as discrete events with associated properties. The system supports multiple data ingestion methods including client-side SDKs (Browser SDK 2.10.0+, iOS Swift SDK, Android Kotlin SDK), server-side APIs (HTTP API v2, Identify API, Dashboard REST API), and third-party integrations (Segment, mParticle). The platform automatically generates unique identifiers including Device IDs, Amplitude IDs, and supports custom User IDs for comprehensive user tracking across sessions and devices.

Key platform capabilities include real-time event streaming, automated data collection through Autocapture functionality, Session Replay integration, and pre-built analytics templates. The system handles data deduplication using event ID/client event time/device ID matching with 7-day insert_id retention, and provides flexible session management (5-minute timeout for mobile, 30-minute for web platforms).

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

Amplitude's feature ecosystem is built around several interconnected components:

**Analytics Foundation**: The core analytics engine processes events and user properties to generate insights through various chart types accessible via the Create > Chart workflow. The platform supports cross-platform instrumentation using shared API keys or separate platform-specific tracking depending on organizational needs.

**Template Gallery**: Pre-built analysis templates including User Activity Reports, Conversion Reports, Feature Adoption Reports, and Ecommerce Reports provide immediate value and best practices. These templates can be converted to customizable dashboards for ongoing analysis.

**Organizational Structure**: The platform uses a hierarchical organization > project > spaces model. Organizations can create multiple projects with separate API keys, while Spaces provide content organization and collaboration capabilities (plan-dependent: Starter plans get 1 space, Plus plans get 3, other plans unlimited).

**Data Management**: The AB Test View feature integrates with experimentation workflows, while behavioral cohorts enable user segmentation. The platform includes comprehensive user identification systems that merge anonymous and identified user data.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Tracking Concepts**:
- **Events**: Discrete user actions tracked with verb+noun naming conventions (limited to 20 properties maximum)
- **Event Properties**: Contextual data describing specific event instances
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes describing user characteristics
- **Sessions**: User interaction periods with platform-specific timeouts

**User Identification System**:
- **Device ID**: Platform-specific identifiers (IDFV for iOS, Advertising Identifier options)
- **Amplitude ID**: System-generated unique user identifier for counting
- **User ID**: Custom identifier for linking user behavior across devices

**Analytics Metrics**:
- **Monthly Tracked Users (MTU)**: Billing metric for active user measurement
- **Active Users**: Users performing tracked events within specified timeframes
- **Retention**: User return behavior measurement
- **Conversion Rates**: Funnel completion analysis

**Platform Infrastructure**:
- **API Keys**: Project-specific authentication tokens for data ingestion
- **Autocapture**: Automated event tracking for Page viewed, Element clicked/changed, Form interactions, Network requests
- **Session Replay ID**: Integration identifier for session recording correlation

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude operates within a comprehensive analytics and optimization ecosystem supporting multiple implementation patterns:

**Implementation Architecture**: Organizations can choose between cross-platform instrumentation (unified API key across iOS, Android, web) or separate platform approaches based on user crossover analysis needs and instrumentation management preferences.

**Team Organization**: The platform supports structured implementation through defined roles - Project Leads coordinate adoption, Data Governors design tracking taxonomies, and Instrumentation Leads handle technical SDK implementation.

**Compliance and Privacy**: Built-in GDPR and CNIL compliance features include consent management through deferInitialization options, opt-out mechanisms via setOptOut(), and configurable cookie storage with AMP_ prefixed cookies.

**Data Regions and Security**: Supports EU and US data storage regions with EU-US Data Privacy Framework compliance, Content Security Policy (CSP) compatibility, and flexible storage options including localStorage fallbacks.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Primary APIs**:
- **HTTP API v2**: Core event ingestion with insert_id deduplication
- **Identify API**: User property management and updates
- **Dashboard REST API**: Programmatic dashboard and chart management
- **Export API**: Data extraction and analysis
- **Attribution API**: Marketing attribution data integration
- **Behavioral Cohorts API**: User segmentation management

**SDK Implementation**:
```javascript
amplitude.init('API_KEY', {
  elementInteractions: true, // Autocapture
  sessionReplay: { sampleRate: 0.1 } // Session Replay
});
```

**Key Configuration Options**:
- `deferInitialization`: Consent management integration
- `cookieExpiration`: Cookie lifecycle management
- `disableCookies`: Privacy-focused implementations
- `enableTracking()`: Post-consent activation

**Browser Compatibility**: Supports browsers with >0.5% market share, explicitly excluding Internet Explorer 11 and undead browsers, with specific version requirements for Firefox, Chrome, Edge, and Safari.

The platform includes comprehensive QA capabilities through real-time User Activity tabs, event stream validation, and automatic property tracking for page-viewed events including Page Domain, Page Location, Page Path, Page Title, and UTM parameters for marketing attribution analysis.
