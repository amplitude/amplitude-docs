# Amplitude Analytics Platform Overview

Amplitude is an event-based analytics platform designed to track and analyze user behavior within digital products. The platform enables teams to gain insights into user engagement, retention, and revenue by collecting and analyzing data about user actions (events), user characteristics, and product usage patterns.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Core Analytics Capabilities
- **Event-based tracking**: Captures user actions within products as events
- **Real-time event stream**: Displays user activity as it happens
- **Chart creation and visualization**: Tools to build custom analytics views
- **Template Gallery**: Pre-built analysis templates for common use cases
- **Dashboard customization**: Ability to create and share custom dashboards
- **A/B testing analysis**: Tools to compare experiment variations
- **User identification**: Cross-device user tracking and identity resolution
- **Session Replay**: Records user interactions for playback and analysis
- **Autocapture**: Automatically collects user interactions with minimal coding

### Analysis Templates
Amplitude offers several pre-built templates for common analytics needs:
- **User Activity Report**: Tracks engagement metrics like DAU, session length, and user breakdowns
- **Conversion Report**: Analyzes funnel conversion rates and drop-off points
- **Feature Adoption Report**: Measures how users adopt and engage with features
- **Ecommerce Report**: Analyzes acquisition channels and purchase behavior
- **A/B Test View**: Compares metrics between experiment groups

## Product Architecture and Organization

### Organization Structure
- **Organizations**: Top-level entities that contain projects and users
- **Projects**: Containers for data related to specific products or app sections
  - Each project has its own API key for data transmission
  - Projects can be set up for cross-platform or separate platform tracking

### Content Organization
- **Spaces**: Collaborative areas for teams to organize and share analyses
  - **Personal workspace**: Private area for individual work
  - **Shared spaces**: Team collaboration areas with permission controls
  - Space limitations vary by plan (1 for Starter, 3 for Plus, unlimited for higher tiers)
- **Folders**: Hierarchical organization within spaces

### User Identification System
- **Device ID**: Identifies unique devices
- **Amplitude ID**: Amplitude's internal user identifier
- **User ID**: Optional customer-provided identifier for cross-device tracking
- Identity resolution merges user activity across devices when user IDs are provided

## Key Terminology and Definitions

### Analytics Concepts
- **Events**: User actions tracked in the system (e.g., page views, clicks, purchases)
- **Event properties**: Additional context about events (e.g., item price, page URL)
- **User properties**: Attributes of users that persist across sessions (e.g., plan type, demographics)
- **Sessions**: Periods of continuous user activity
- **Behavioral cohort**: Group of users who performed specific actions
- **Monthly tracked user (MTU)**: Unique user tracked within a month (billing metric)
- **Retention**: Measure of users returning to the product over time
- **Stickiness**: Frequency of user engagement within a time period
- **Funnel analysis**: Tracking user progression through a sequence of events

### Automatically Tracked Properties
- **Event properties**: Page domain, URL, location, referrer, session replay ID
- **User properties**: Location (country, region, city), device type, platform, OS

## Implementation and Setup

### Implementation Process
1. **Create an account and project**
2. **Plan implementation**:
   - Define business goals
   - Determine user identification strategy
   - Create event taxonomy with naming conventions
   - Select key events to track (quality over quantity)
3. **Implement data collection**:
   - Install SDK (Browser, iOS-Swift, Android-Kotlin)
   - Set up user identification
   - Configure event tracking
4. **Verify implementation**:
   - Use User Activity tab to check tracked events
   - Monitor event limits and deduplication

### Implementation Team Roles
- **Project Lead**: Coordinates with Amplitude and drives adoption
- **Data Governor**: Designs tracking plans and maintains data quality
- **Instrumentation Lead**: Handles technical implementation and troubleshooting

### Data Collection Methods
- **Client-side SDKs**: Browser, iOS, Android
- **Server-side APIs**: HTTP API v2, Batch API
- **Integrations**: Third-party data sources
- **Autocapture**: Automatic collection of interactions, page views, and forms

## Technical Details

### SDK Implementation
```html
<!-- Basic Amplitude snippet -->
<script type="text/javascript">
  !function(){var e=window.amplitude||{_q:[],_iq:{}};/* initialization code */}();
  amplitude.init("YOUR_API_KEY");
</script>
```

### Key APIs
- **Identify API**: Update user properties
- **HTTP API v2**: Send events server-side
- **Batch API**: Send multiple events in one request
- **Dashboard REST API**: Programmatically access dashboards
- **Export API**: Extract raw data

### Browser Compatibility
- Supports browsers with >0.5% worldwide usage
- Recent versions of Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Safari
- Excludes Internet Explorer and Op_mini

### Cookies and Consent
- Uses cookies or localStorage for user identification
- Supports opt-in/opt-out mechanisms for consent management
- Configurable cookie expiration and SameSite settings
- Compliant with GDPR and CNIL (France) regulations

## Workflow Optimization

Amplitude recommends a six-step workflow for product optimization:
1. Identify critical events and usage intervals
2. Analyze retention patterns
3. Map user lifecycle stages
4. Identify user personas
5. Create engagement matrices
6. Conduct ongoing cohort analysis and A/B testing

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Analytics integrates with:
- **Session Replay**: Records user sessions for visual playback
- **Experiment**: A/B testing platform with direct results analysis
- Various third-party data sources and destinations through integrations

Amplitude's platform is designed to scale from simple analytics needs to complex, enterprise-wide implementations, with different plan tiers offering varying levels of features, data volume, and organizational capabilities.
