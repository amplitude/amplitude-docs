# Amplitude Analytics Platform Overview

Amplitude is an event-based analytics platform designed to track and analyze user behavior within digital products. The platform enables teams to gain insights into user engagement, retention, and revenue by collecting and analyzing data about user interactions.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Core Analytics Capabilities
- **Event-based tracking**: Captures user actions (events) and their contextual details (event properties)
- **User identification**: Tracks unique users across devices and sessions
- **Real-time event stream**: Monitors user activity as it happens
- **Template Gallery**: Pre-built analysis templates for common use cases
- **Customizable dashboards**: Create and share visualizations of product metrics
- **A/B testing analysis**: Compare experiment groups and measure impact
- **Session Replay**: Record and review user interactions with your product
- **Autocapture**: Automatically collect analytics data with minimal engineering effort

### Key Analytics Use Cases
- Conversion rate optimization
- Feature adoption analysis
- User activity monitoring
- Acquisition channel analysis
- Retention analysis
- User journey optimization
- Behavioral cohort analysis

## Product Architecture and Organization

### Organization Structure
- **Organizations**: Top-level container for all projects and users
- **Projects**: Separate containers for different products or environments, each with its own API key
- **Spaces**: Collaborative areas where teams organize and share analyses
  - Personal workspaces (private by default)
  - Shared spaces (for team collaboration)
  - Available on all plans but limited based on plan tier (1 for Starter, 3 for Plus)

### Data Collection Methods
1. **Client-side SDKs**:
   - Browser SDK (JavaScript)
   - iOS-Swift SDK
   - Android-Kotlin SDK

2. **Server-side options**:
   - Server SDKs
   - HTTP API v2
   - Batch API

3. **Integration options**:
   - Third-party data sources
   - Import APIs

### User Identification System
- **Device ID**: Automatically generated for each device
- **Amplitude ID**: Internal ID that links events to a user
- **User ID**: Optional customer-provided ID for cross-device tracking
- **Identity resolution**: Merges user activity across devices and sessions

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Analytics Terminology
- **Events**: User actions tracked in your product (e.g., page views, button clicks)
- **Event properties**: Contextual details about events (e.g., page URL, button name)
- **User properties**: Attributes of users that persist across sessions (e.g., plan type, account age)
- **Sessions**: Periods of continuous user activity, defined by timeout thresholds
- **Cohorts**: Groups of users who share common behaviors or attributes
- **Funnels**: Series of steps users take toward a conversion goal
- **Monthly Tracked Users (MTU)**: Unique users tracked per month, often tied to billing

### Automatically Tracked Properties
1. **Default Event Properties**:
   - Page Domain, Page URL, Page Location
   - Event Day of Week, Event Time
   - Session Replay ID (when enabled)

2. **Default User Properties**:
   - Location data (City, Country, Region)
   - Device information (OS, Platform, Device Family)
   - Initial referrer and UTM parameters

## Implementation Process

### Setup and Planning
1. Create an Amplitude account
2. Create an organization and project
3. Define business goals and metrics
4. Plan your implementation approach:
   - Define user identification strategy
   - Create event taxonomy and naming conventions
   - Select critical events to track
   - Organize implementation team roles:
     - Project Lead
     - Data Governor
     - Instrumentation Lead

### Implementation Options
1. **Basic implementation**: Add Amplitude snippet to your application
   ```html
   <script type="text/javascript">
   !function(){"use strict";!function(e,t){var r=e.amplitude||{_q:[],_iq:{}};/* ... */}
   (function(){
     var s = document.createElement('script');
     s.type = 'text/javascript';
     s.async = true;
     s.src = 'https://cdn.amplitude.com/libs/amplitude-8.21.4-min.gz.js';
     var x = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
     x.parentNode.insertBefore(s, x);
   })();
   amplitude.getInstance().init("YOUR_API_KEY_HERE", null, {
     // Optional configuration options
   });
   </script>
   ```

2. **Advanced implementation**:
   - Use SDKs for platform-specific tracking
   - Implement Autocapture for automatic event collection
   - Use Ampli Wrapper for type-safe instrumentation

### Data Verification
- Use the User Activity tab to verify events are being tracked correctly
- Check for proper user identification
- Monitor event limits and deduplication

## APIs and Technical Interfaces

### Key APIs
- **Identify API**: Update user properties
- **HTTP API v2**: Send events server-side
- **Batch API**: Send multiple events in one request
- **Dashboard REST API**: Programmatically manage dashboards
- **Export API**: Extract raw data
- **Attribution API**: Track marketing attribution
- **Behavioral Cohorts API**: Create and manage user cohorts

### Technical Considerations
- **Cookies and Consent Management**:
  - Options for cookie storage, expiration, and SameSite settings
  - Opt-in/opt-out mechanisms for GDPR compliance
  - CNIL (France) compliance options

- **Browser Compatibility**:
  - Supports browsers with >0.5% worldwide usage
  - Supports recent versions of Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Safari
  - Excludes Internet Explorer and Op_mini

## Analytics Workflow

### Recommended Analysis Approach
1. Identify critical events and usage intervals
2. Analyze retention patterns
3. Map user lifecycle stages
4. Identify user personas
5. Create engagement matrices
6. Perform cohort analysis and A/B testing
