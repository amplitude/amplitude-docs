Amplitude is a comprehensive event-based product analytics platform designed to help businesses understand user behavior, optimize engagement, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform provides real-time analytics capabilities, pre-built templates, and extensive customization options for tracking user interactions across web, mobile, and cross-platform applications.

## Core Product Architecture and Features

Amplitude's analytics platform centers around several key components working together to provide comprehensive user behavior insights:

**Analytics Dashboard and Home Page**: The Amplitude Home page serves as the central hub featuring a real-time event stream, Quick Actions section for rapid chart creation, template gallery access, and default dashboard widgets displaying user metrics and analytics overviews. Users can create charts through the Create > Chart workflow with plan-specific restrictions (Starter plan: 10-chart limit with 1-year data queries; Plus plan: 2-year data limits).

**Spaces and Organization**: Amplitude uses Spaces for content organization and team collaboration, with personal workspaces and shared spaces supporting folder structures. Plan restrictions apply (Starter: 1 space, Plus: 3 spaces, unlimited for other plans), enabling discoverable content search and team analytics collaboration.

**Template System**: The platform includes a comprehensive Template Gallery accessible from the Home page, offering pre-built analysis templates for common use cases including:
- User Activity Report (daily active users, session duration, retention metrics)
- Conversion Report (funnel analysis, drop-off behavior tracking)
- Feature Adoption Report (8 pre-built charts analyzing feature usage patterns)
- Ecommerce Report (acquisition channel analysis with UTM parameter tracking)

## Data Collection and Instrumentation

**SDK Implementation**: Amplitude supports multiple data ingestion methods through various SDKs:
- Browser SDK (2.10.0+) with JavaScript snippet implementation
- iOS Swift SDK with autocapture capabilities
- Android Kotlin SDK with automatic event tracking
- Cross-platform instrumentation options using shared API keys

**Autocapture Technology**: The platform provides automatic event tracking including:
- Page viewed events with UTM parameter tracking
- Element clicked/changed events with visual labeling
- Form started/submitted events
- Session management (Start/End session events)
- Application lifecycle events and deep link tracking
- Network request monitoring

**API Integration**: Multiple APIs support data ingestion and management:
- HTTP API v2 with insert_id deduplication (7-day retention window)
- Identify API for user property updates
- Dashboard REST API, Export API, Attribution API
- Behavioral Cohorts API and Batch API

## User Identification and Tracking System

Amplitude employs a sophisticated three-tier user identification system:

**Device-Level Tracking**: Uses device IDs (IDFV, Advertising Identifier) for initial user recognition across sessions.

**Amplitude ID**: Automatically generated unique identifier for user counting and cross-device event reconciliation.

**User ID Assignment**: Custom user identifiers for authenticated users, supporting backend user data merging and anonymous-to-identified user transitions with case-sensitive handling.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events and Properties**: Events represent user actions tracked with verb+noun naming conventions (limited to 20 properties maximum). Event properties provide contextual information, while user properties describe user characteristics and are automatically updated.

**Sessions**: Time-bounded user activity periods with platform-specific timeouts (5 minutes for mobile, 30 minutes for web) managed through Session IDs using milliseconds epoch timestamps.

**User Metrics**: 
- Monthly Tracked Users (MTU): Unique users counted via amplitude_id
- Active Users: Users performing tracked events within specified timeframes
- Retention: User return behavior measured across defined intervals

**Behavioral Cohorts**: User segments based on shared behaviors or characteristics, supporting advanced segmentation and analysis.

## Analytics Capabilities and Workflows

**Chart Types and Analysis**: The platform supports various analytical approaches including:
- Event Segmentation charts for behavior analysis
- Funnel analysis for conversion tracking
- Retention analysis for user lifecycle understanding
- Pathfinder for user journey mapping
- A/B testing through AB Test View with user property segmentation

**Optimization Workflow**: Amplitude promotes a 6-step optimization process:
1. Critical event identification
2. Usage interval determination  
3. Retention analysis
4. User lifecycle graphing
5. Persona mapping and clustering
6. Engagement matrix analysis

**Quality Assurance**: Real-time event verification through User Activity tabs, event stream validation, and deduplication systems using event ID/client event time/device ID matching.

## Data Management and Compliance

**Storage and Privacy**: Supports data region selection (US/EU) with EU-US Data Privacy Framework compliance, cookie management through AMP_ prefixed cookies, and GDPR/CNIL compliance features including consent management integration.

**Browser Compatibility**: Maintains compatibility requirements based on market share thresholds (0.5%+) for major browsers while excluding Internet Explorer 11 and legacy browsers.

**Event Limits and Restrictions**: Implements monthly event limits with data accessibility restrictions and automatic deduplication to maintain data quality and platform performance.

The platform integrates with third-party tools including Segment, mParticle, and Optimizely, while supporting various data export formats (PNG, PDF, CSV) and providing comprehensive debugging tools for implementation validation.
