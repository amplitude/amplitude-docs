Amplitude is a comprehensive event-based product analytics platform that enables businesses to understand user behavior, optimize engagement, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform provides real-time tracking, analysis, and visualization of user interactions across web, mobile, and cross-platform applications.

## Core Product Architecture and Features

Amplitude's analytics platform centers around several interconnected components that work together to provide comprehensive user behavior analysis:

**Analytics Dashboard and Home Page**: The Amplitude Home page serves as the central hub, providing product overview metrics, real-time event streams, quick chart creation via Event Segmentation, and access to the template gallery for pre-built dashboard templates.

**Data Collection and SDKs**: The platform supports multiple data ingestion methods including Browser SDK (2.10.0+), iOS Swift SDK, Android Kotlin SDK, HTTP API v2, and various third-party integrations. The Browser SDK includes advanced features like Autocapture for automatic event tracking, Session Replay capabilities, and comprehensive marketing attribution through UTM parameters.

**Chart Creation and Visualization**: Users can create unlimited charts (Starter plans limited to 10) through the Create > Chart menu, with support for Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, and User Sessions analytics. Charts can be exported in PNG, PDF, or CSV formats and integrated into dashboards or notebooks.

**Template System**: Amplitude provides pre-built templates including Ecommerce Report, Feature Adoption Report, Conversion Report, and User Activity Report templates that can be converted to customizable dashboards for specific business use cases.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

The platform's features are designed to work cohesively within a unified analytics workflow. The data collection layer (SDKs and APIs) feeds into the visualization layer (charts and dashboards), which connects to the template system for rapid deployment of common analytics use cases. The Spaces feature enables content organization and collaboration with plan-based restrictions (Starter: 1 space, Plus: 3 spaces, unlimited for other plans), supporting both personal workspaces and shared team environments.

Cross-platform tracking capabilities allow organizations to choose between unified instrumentation (single API key across iOS, Android, web) or separate platform instrumentation depending on user crossover analysis needs and platform-specific tracking requirements.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**User Identification System**:
- **Amplitude ID**: Platform-generated unique identifier for user tracking
- **Device ID**: Platform-specific identifiers (IDFV for iOS, Advertising Identifier)
- **User ID**: Custom identifier assigned by developers for cross-device tracking

**Event Tracking Framework**:
- **Events**: User actions tracked with verb+noun naming conventions (limited to 20 properties maximum)
- **Event Properties**: Contextual data attached to specific events
- **User Properties**: Persistent characteristics associated with users
- **Inactive Events**: Events that haven't occurred recently but remain in the system

**Session Management**:
- **Session Timeout**: 5 minutes for mobile platforms, 30 minutes for web
- **Session ID**: Milliseconds since epoch UTC timestamp
- **Monthly Tracked Users (MTU)**: Billing metric for unique users per month

**Analytics Concepts**:
- **Active Users**: Users who performed any tracked event in a given timeframe
- **Retention**: Percentage of users returning after initial engagement
- **Stickiness**: Frequency of user engagement within time periods
- **Behavioral Cohorts**: User groups based on shared behaviors or characteristics

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude operates within a comprehensive product ecosystem through multiple integration points:

**Data Sources**: The platform integrates with client-side SDKs, server-side APIs, third-party tools, and supports CSV uploads. The Identify API handles user property updates, while the HTTP API v2 manages server-side event tracking.

**Privacy and Compliance**: Built-in GDPR/CNIL compliance features include consent management through `deferInitialization` and `enableTracking()` methods, cookie management with AMP_ prefixed cookies, and opt-out mechanisms via `setOptOut()` functionality.

**Organizational Structure**: Amplitude supports multi-project organizations through Settings > Organization settings > Projects, with project-specific API keys, user role assignments, and data segregation for different environments (dev, test, production).

The platform follows a structured 6-step optimization workflow: critical event identification, usage interval determination, retention analysis, lifecycle graphing, persona mapping, and engagement matrix analysis, followed by ongoing cohort comparison and A/B testing.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Key API Methods**:
- `amplitude.init()`: SDK initialization with API key
- `amplitude.getInstance().init()`: Instance-based initialization
- `enableTracking()`: Consent management activation
- `setOptOut()`: User privacy control
- `clearStorage()`: Data cleanup functionality

**Configuration Options**:
- `elementInteractions`: Autocapture configuration
- `deferInitialization`: GDPR compliance setup
- `disableCookies`: Local storage alternative
- `cookieExpiration`: Cookie lifecycle management
- `sessionTimeout`: Custom session duration settings

**Data Endpoints**:
- HTTP API v2 for server-side event ingestion
- Identify API for user property updates
- Export API for JSON data extraction
- Attribution API for campaign tracking
- Behavioral Cohorts API for segment management

Implementation requires three key team roles: Project Lead (coordinates adoption), Data Governor (designs tracking plans and taxonomy), and Instrumentation Lead (implements SDK events and validates data sources). The platform supports browser compatibility based on 0.5% market share thresholds while explicitly excluding Internet Explorer 11.
