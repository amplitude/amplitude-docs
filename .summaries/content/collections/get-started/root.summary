# Amplitude Analytics Platform Overview

Amplitude is an event-based analytics platform that tracks and analyzes user behavior within digital products. The platform helps teams gain insights into user engagement, retention, and revenue by collecting and analyzing data about user interactions.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Core Analytics Capabilities
- **Real-time event tracking** captures user actions as they happen
- **User behavior analysis** examines interactions across platforms
- **Conversion and funnel analysis** tracks user progression through critical paths
- **Retention analysis** measures ongoing user engagement
- **A/B test analysis** compares performance between experiment groups
- **Feature adoption tracking** monitors user engagement with specific features
- **Acquisition channel analysis** identifies effective user acquisition channels

### Data Collection and Management
- **Autocapture** automatically collects analytics data with minimal engineering
- **Cross-platform tracking** follows users across multiple platforms and devices
- **User identification** tracks unique users through various ID types
- **Event and user properties** capture detailed context about actions and users
- **Session tracking** groups activities into meaningful interaction periods

### Visualization and Organization
- **Customizable dashboards** create visual representations of key metrics
- **Chart creation** builds various visualizations of data
- **Spaces** organize analyses in personal or shared workspaces
- **Template gallery** provides pre-built templates for common analyses
- **Folders and shortcuts** organize content for better discoverability

## Product Relationships and Architecture

### Data Collection Components
1. **SDKs and APIs**:
   - Browser SDK (JavaScript)
   - iOS-Swift SDK
   - Android-Kotlin SDK
   - HTTP API v2 (server-side)
   - Identify API (for user properties)
   - Batch API (for multiple events)

2. **Implementation Methods**:
   - JavaScript snippet in head tag
   - Ampli Wrapper for typed implementation
   - Integrations with third-party data sources
   - Server-side tracking

### Analytics Components
1. **Projects**: Containers for organizing analytics by product or app section
   - Each project has its own API key
   - Created through Organization settings

2. **Spaces**: Organizational units for analyses and dashboards
   - Personal workspace (private)
   - Shared spaces (collaborative)
   - Availability varies by plan (Starter: 1 space, Plus: 3 spaces)

3. **Analysis Tools**:
   - Chart creation interface
   - Template gallery
   - AB Test View
   - User Activity tab
   - User Lookup
   - Microscope for event inspection

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Data Model Elements
- **Events**: User actions tracked in the product
- **Event properties**: Additional context about events
- **Users**: Individuals interacting with the product
- **User properties**: Attributes describing users
- **Sessions**: Periods of continuous product usage
- **Amplitude ID**: Unique identifier assigned by Amplitude
- **Device ID**: Identifier for a specific device
- **User ID**: Optional custom identifier for cross-device tracking

### Analytics Metrics
- **Active users**: Users who performed at least one event in a time period
- **Monthly tracked users (MTU)**: Unique users tracked in a month
- **Retention**: Return rate of users over time
- **Stickiness**: Frequency of user engagement
- **Conversion rate**: Percentage of users completing a defined sequence
- **Behavioral cohort**: Group of users who performed specific actions

### Implementation Concepts
- **Tracking plan**: Documentation of events, properties, and implementation details
- **Data taxonomy**: Structured organization of analytics data
- **Instrumentation**: Process of implementing analytics tracking
- **Event deduplication**: Process to prevent duplicate event logging

## Implementation and Workflow

### Implementation Process
1. **Pre-implementation planning**:
   - Define business goals and metrics
   - Determine user identification strategy
   - Create event taxonomy and naming conventions
   - Decide on cross-platform vs. separate platform approach

2. **Team organization**:
   - Project Lead coordinates implementation
   - Data Governor designs tracking plans
   - Instrumentation Lead handles technical implementation

3. **Data implementation**:
   - Install SDK or snippet
   - Configure user identification
   - Implement event tracking
   - Verify data flow using User Activity tab

4. **Analysis creation**:
   - Create charts and dashboards
   - Organize content in spaces
   - Share insights with team members
