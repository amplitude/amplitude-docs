Amplitude is a comprehensive event-based product analytics platform designed to help businesses understand user behavior, optimize engagement, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform enables organizations to track, analyze, and act on user interactions across web, mobile, and cross-platform experiences.

## Core Product Architecture and Features

Amplitude's analytics platform centers around event-based tracking, where user interactions are captured as discrete events with associated properties. The system supports multiple data ingestion methods including Browser SDK, iOS/Android SDKs, HTTP API v2, and third-party integrations through platforms like Segment and mParticle. Key features include real-time event streaming, autocapture functionality for automatic event tracking, session replay capabilities, and visual labeling for enhanced data collection.

The platform provides pre-built analysis templates through the Template Gallery, including User Activity Reports, Feature Adoption Reports, Conversion Reports, and Ecommerce Reports. These templates can be converted into customizable dashboards for ongoing analysis. The Home page serves as a central hub featuring real-time event streams, quick chart creation tools, and dashboard widgets for immediate insights.

## Product Relationships and Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude operates through a hierarchical structure of organizations, projects, and spaces. Organizations contain multiple projects (each with unique API keys), while Spaces provide collaborative workspaces for organizing analytics content. The platform supports both cross-platform instrumentation (single API key across platforms) and separate platform approaches depending on business needs.

The system integrates with various data sources through its Source Catalog and provides multiple APIs including the Identify API for user properties, Dashboard REST API, Export API, Attribution API, and Behavioral Cohorts API. A/B testing capabilities are built-in through the AB Test View feature, supporting integration with platforms like Optimizely.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**User Identification System**: Amplitude employs a three-tier identification system using Device IDs (platform-specific identifiers like IDFV), Amplitude IDs (unique cross-device identifiers), and User IDs (custom business identifiers). The platform automatically handles user reconciliation and event merging across devices.

**Events and Properties**: Events represent user actions with associated event properties providing context. User properties describe user characteristics and are automatically tracked (device info, location via MaxMind GeoIP) or manually set. The system enforces a 20-property limit per event and uses verb+noun naming conventions.

**Sessions**: Mobile platforms use 5-minute session timeouts while web platforms use 30-minute timeouts. Sessions are tracked via Session IDs using milliseconds epoch timestamps.

**Analytics Metrics**: Key metrics include Monthly Tracked Users (MTU), Active Users, retention rates, and conversion funnels. The platform distinguishes between active and inactive events for different analysis purposes.

## Technical Implementation and APIs

**SDK Implementation**: The Browser SDK (version 2.10.0+) supports autocapture with elementInteractions configuration, while mobile SDKs provide platform-specific tracking. Installation involves API key initialization through `amplitude.init()` or JavaScript snippet implementation.

**Data Ingestion APIs**: 
- HTTP API v2 for server-side event tracking with insert_id deduplication
- Identify API for user property updates
- Batch API for bulk data processing
- Export API for data extraction

**Autocapture Functionality**: Automatically tracks Page viewed, Element clicked, Form submitted, Application lifecycle, and Screen viewed events across platforms with configurable options for visual labeling and interaction properties.

## Broader Product Ecosystem

Amplitude fits into the broader analytics and growth ecosystem as a comprehensive product analytics solution. It supports GDPR and CNIL compliance through consent management features, offers data residency options (US/EU regions), and integrates with marketing attribution through UTM parameter tracking. The platform scales from Free/Starter plans (with limitations like 10-chart limits and 1-year data retention) to Plus and enterprise plans offering unlimited spaces, extended data retention, and advanced features.

The system supports various industry-specific implementations including ecommerce (with purchase tracking and acquisition analysis), B2B/SaaS (trial conversion and feature adoption), gaming (level completion and engagement), healthcare (appointment scheduling), and media/content (consumption tracking) use cases.

Quality assurance is facilitated through real-time event verification via the User Activity tab, with built-in deduplication using event ID/client event time/device ID matching and 7-day insert_id retention for HTTP API implementations.
