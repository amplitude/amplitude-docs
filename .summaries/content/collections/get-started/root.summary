# Amplitude Analytics Platform Overview

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude is an event-based analytics platform that tracks and analyzes user behavior within digital products. The platform helps teams gain insights into user engagement, retention, and revenue by collecting and analyzing data about user interactions. Key features include event-based tracking, user identification across devices, real-time event streaming, customizable dashboards, A/B testing analysis, Session Replay, and Autocapture functionality.

The platform supports various analytics use cases including conversion rate optimization, feature adoption analysis, user activity monitoring, acquisition channel analysis, retention analysis, user journey optimization, and behavioral cohort analysis.

## Product Relationships and Structure

Amplitude's product architecture follows a hierarchical organization:

1. **Organizations**: Top-level containers that house all projects and users
2. **Projects**: Separate containers for different products or environments, each with its own API key
3. **Spaces**: Collaborative areas where teams organize and share analyses
   - Personal workspaces (private by default)
   - Shared spaces (for team collaboration)
   - Availability varies by plan tier (1 for Starter, 3 for Plus)

Data collection in Amplitude can be implemented through multiple methods:
- **Client-side SDKs**: Browser (JavaScript), iOS-Swift, and Android-Kotlin
- **Server-side options**: Server SDKs, HTTP API v2, and Batch API
- **Integration options**: Third-party data sources and Import APIs

The user identification system employs multiple ID types:
- **Device ID**: Automatically generated for each device
- **Amplitude ID**: Internal ID linking events to users
- **User ID**: Customer-provided ID enabling cross-device tracking
- **Identity resolution**: System that merges user activity across devices and sessions

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Analytics Terminology
- **Events**: User actions tracked in products (page views, button clicks, etc.)
- **Event properties**: Contextual details about events (page URL, button name, etc.)
- **User properties**: Persistent user attributes across sessions (plan type, account age, etc.)
- **Sessions**: Periods of continuous user activity defined by timeout thresholds
- **Cohorts**: Groups of users sharing common behaviors or attributes
- **Funnels**: Series of steps users take toward a conversion goal
- **Monthly Tracked Users (MTU)**: Unique users tracked per month, often tied to billing

### Automatically Tracked Properties
- **Default Event Properties**: Page Domain, Page URL, Event Day of Week, Event Time, Session Replay ID
- **Default User Properties**: Location data (City, Country), Device information (OS, Platform), Initial referrer and UTM parameters

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates into the broader product analytics ecosystem through:

1. **Data Collection Integration**:
   - Client and server-side SDKs for various platforms
   - HTTP and Batch APIs for server-side implementation
   - Third-party data source connections

2. **Analysis Tools**:
   - Charts for visualizing behavior data
   - Dashboards for organizing multiple charts
   - Templates for pre-built analyses (User Activity, Conversion, Feature Adoption reports)

3. **Industry-Specific Solutions**:
   - Tailored event tracking recommendations for media, ecommerce, B2B/SaaS, finance, healthcare, and gaming

4. **Implementation Workflow**:
   - Setup and planning process
   - Basic and advanced implementation options
   - Data verification procedures

## Technical Interfaces and APIs

Amplitude provides several APIs for integration and data management:

- **Identify API**: Updates user properties
- **HTTP API v2**: Sends events server-side
- **Batch API**: Sends multiple events in one request
- **Dashboard REST API**: Programmatically manages dashboards
- **Export API**: Extracts raw data
- **Attribution API**: Tracks marketing attribution
- **Behavioral Cohorts API**: Creates and manages user cohorts

Basic implementation involves adding the Amplitude snippet to your application:
```html
<script type="text/javascript">
!function(){"use strict";!function(e,t){var r=e.amplitude||{_q:[],_iq:{}};/* ... */}
(function(){
  var s = document.createElement('script');
  s.type = 'text/javascript';
  s.async = true;
  s.src = 'https://cdn.amplitude.com/libs/amplitude-8.21.4-min.gz.js';
  var x = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
  x.parentNode.insertBefore(s, x);
})();
amplitude.getInstance().init("YOUR_API_KEY_HERE", null, {
  // Optional configuration options
});
</script>
```

Advanced implementation options include using platform-specific SDKs, implementing Autocapture for automatic event collection, and using the Ampli Wrapper for type-safe instrumentation.
