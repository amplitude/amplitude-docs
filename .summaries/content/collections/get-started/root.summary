Amplitude is a comprehensive event-based product analytics platform designed to help organizations understand user behavior, optimize engagement, and drive product growth through data-driven insights.

## Core Product Overview

Amplitude Analytics serves as the central product offering, providing real-time user behavior tracking through an event-based architecture. The platform captures user interactions as events with associated properties, enabling detailed analysis of user journeys, feature adoption, conversion rates, and retention patterns. Key capabilities include automated event tracking through Autocapture, customizable dashboards, pre-built analytical templates, and cross-platform user identification.

The platform supports multiple data ingestion methods including client-side SDKs (Browser, iOS, Android), server-side APIs (HTTP API v2, Identify API), and third-party integrations. Real-time event streaming provides immediate visibility into user actions, while the User Activity tab enables debugging and QA validation of instrumentation.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

### Analytics Core Components
- **Amplitude Home Page**: Central dashboard providing product metrics overview, real-time event streams, quick chart creation via Event Segmentation, and template gallery access
- **Spaces**: Organizational system for content management with personal workspaces and shared collaboration spaces (plan-restricted: Starter 1 space, Plus 3 spaces, unlimited for higher tiers)
- **Charts and Dashboards**: Customizable visualization tools with plan limitations (Starter plans limited to 10 charts, 1-year data queries)
- **Template Gallery**: Pre-built analytical templates including Feature Adoption Report, Conversion Report, User Activity Report, and Ecommerce Report

### Data Collection and Management
- **Autocapture**: Automated event tracking for web (Browser SDK 2.10.0+), iOS, and Android platforms, capturing page views, form interactions, element clicks/changes, and session events
- **Session Replay**: Integrated recording capability with configurable sample rates and Session Replay ID tracking
- **Cross-Platform Tracking**: Unified user identification across iOS, Android, and web platforms using shared API keys

### User Identification System
The platform employs a three-tier identification system:
- **Device IDs**: Platform-specific identifiers (IDFV for iOS, generated IDs for web/Android)
- **Amplitude IDs**: Internal user identifiers prefixed with "amp_"
- **User IDs**: Custom identifiers for authenticated users, enabling cross-device event reconciliation

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Event Architecture
- **Events**: User actions tracked with verb+noun naming conventions (e.g., "Page Viewed", "Item Added")
- **Event Properties**: Contextual data attached to events (maximum 20 properties per event)
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes describing user characteristics
- **Inactive Events**: Events excluded from active user calculations
- **Event ID**: Unique identifier for deduplication using client event time and device ID matching

### User Metrics
- **Active Users**: Users who triggered any non-inactive event within specified timeframes
- **Monthly Tracked Users (MTU)**: Billing metric for unique users per month
- **Session Management**: Platform-specific timeouts (5 minutes mobile, 30 minutes web)
- **Session ID**: Millisecond timestamp since epoch UTC
- **Retention**: User return behavior analysis
- **Stickiness**: Frequency of user engagement within periods

### Analytics Constructs
- **Behavioral Cohorts**: User segments based on shared behaviors
- **Funnels**: Sequential event analysis for conversion tracking
- **Any Active Event**: Aggregate of all non-inactive events
- **Any Event**: Includes all events regardless of active status

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

### SDK and API Ecosystem
- **Browser SDK**: Primary web tracking with JavaScript snippet installation and `amplitude.init()` configuration
- **Mobile SDKs**: iOS Swift SDK and Android Kotlin SDK with platform-specific autocapture
- **HTTP API v2**: Server-side event ingestion with 7-day insert_id retention for deduplication
- **Identify API**: User property management and updates
- **Export API**: Data extraction in JSON format
- **Attribution API**: Campaign and marketing attribution
- **Behavioral Cohorts API**: Programmatic cohort management

### Data Privacy and Compliance
- **Cookie Management**: AMP_ prefixed first-party cookies with consent management through `deferInitialization`
- **GDPR/CNIL Compliance**: Opt-out mechanisms via `setOptOut()` and `enableTracking()` methods
- **Storage Options**: Configurable cookie settings including `disableCookies`, `cookieExpiration`, and localStorage alternatives

### Integration Capabilities
- **Third-Party Platforms**: Native integrations including Optimizely for A/B testing
- **UTM Parameter Tracking**: Automatic campaign attribution through utm_source and related parameters
- **MaxMind GeoIP**: Automatic location property derivation from IP addresses
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Compatible implementation for secure environments

## Implementation Workflow and Team Structure

The platform requires three key implementation roles:
- **Project Lead**: Coordinates with Success Managers and drives organizational adoption
- **Data Governor**: Designs tracking plans, maintains data taxonomy, and ensures data quality
- **Instrumentation Lead**: Implements SDK events and validates data sources

The recommended implementation follows a structured approach: business goal definition, event taxonomy planning using spreadsheet templates, cross-platform vs. separate-platform project decisions, SDK instrumentation, and ongoing optimization through the 6-step Amplitude workflow (critical event identification, usage interval determination, retention analysis, lifecycle graphing, persona mapping, and engagement matrix analysis).

Browser compatibility targets analytics.amplitude.com with support for browsers maintaining >0.5% market share, explicitly excluding Internet Explorer 11 and undead browsers, ensuring modern web standard compliance across the analytics interface.
