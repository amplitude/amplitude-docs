Amplitude is a comprehensive event-based product analytics platform designed to help businesses understand user behavior, optimize engagement, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform provides real-time tracking, analysis, and visualization of user interactions across web, mobile, and cross-platform applications.

## Core Product Architecture and Features

Amplitude's analytics ecosystem centers around several key components:

**Analytics Dashboard and Home Page**: The central hub featuring real-time event streams, quick chart creation via Event Segmentation, template gallery access, and product overview metrics. Users can create charts through the Create > Chart menu with plan-specific limitations (Starter plans limited to 10 charts and 1-year data queries).

**Data Collection and Instrumentation**: Multiple ingestion methods including Browser SDK (2.10.0+), iOS/Android SDKs, HTTP API v2, third-party integrations, and various specialized APIs (Identify API, Attribution API, Export API, Behavioral Cohorts API). The platform supports both client-side and server-side data sources with project-level API key initialization.

**Autocapture Technology**: Automated event tracking for web, iOS, and Android platforms capturing Page viewed events, Element clicked tracking, Form started/submitted events, marketing attribution, UTM parameters, and application lifecycle events without manual instrumentation.

**Template System**: Pre-built analysis templates including Ecommerce Report, Feature Adoption Report, Conversion Report, and User Activity Report, accessible through the Template Gallery and convertible to customizable dashboards.

**Spaces and Organization**: Content organization system with personal workspaces, shared spaces for collaboration, and folder structures. Plan restrictions apply (Starter: 1 space, Plus: 3 spaces, unlimited for other plans).

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**User Identification System**:
- **Amplitude ID**: Platform-generated unique identifier
- **Device ID**: Platform-specific identifiers (IDFV for iOS, Advertising Identifier)
- **User ID**: Custom business-defined identifier for cross-device tracking

**Event Architecture**:
- **Events**: User actions tracked with verb+noun naming conventions
- **Event Properties**: Contextual data attached to events (maximum 20 properties per event)
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes describing user characteristics
- **Inactive Events**: Events excluded from active user calculations

**Session Management**:
- **Session Timeout**: 5 minutes for mobile, 30 minutes for web
- **Session ID**: Milliseconds since epoch UTC timestamp

**Analytics Metrics**:
- **Monthly Tracked Users (MTU)**: Billing metric for active users
- **Active Users**: Users triggering non-inactive events
- **Retention**: User return behavior analysis
- **Stickiness**: Engagement frequency measurement
- **Behavioral Cohorts**: User groups based on shared behaviors

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude operates within a broader analytics and optimization ecosystem through:

**Implementation Team Structure**: Three critical roles including Project Lead (coordinates adoption), Data Governor (designs tracking plans and taxonomy), and Instrumentation Lead (implements SDK events and validates data sources).

**Cross-Platform Strategy**: Supports both unified cross-platform instrumentation (single API key across iOS, Android, web) and separate platform approaches depending on user crossover analysis needs and platform-specific behaviors.

**A/B Testing Integration**: Native AB Test View functionality with user property association for experiment variations, supporting both per-experiment and unified property strategies, with Optimizely integration capabilities.

**Compliance and Privacy**: GDPR/CNIL compliance features including consent management, opt-out mechanisms, cookie management with AMP_ prefixes, and deferInitialization options for consent platforms.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Primary APIs**:
- HTTP API v2 for server-side event ingestion with insert_id deduplication (7-day retention)
- Identify API for user property updates
- Dashboard REST API for programmatic access
- Export API for JSON data extraction
- Attribution API for campaign data
- Behavioral Cohorts API for segment management

**SDK Implementation**:
- Browser SDK initialization via `amplitude.init()` with JavaScript snippet
- iOS Swift SDK with autocapture capabilities
- Android Kotlin SDK with lifecycle tracking
- Element interaction configuration through `elementInteractions`

**Key Configuration Options**:
- `deferInitialization` for consent management
- `disableCookies` for cookieless tracking
- `setOptOut()` and `enableTracking()` for privacy controls
- `cookieExpiration` and `sameSiteCookie` for cookie management

## Workflow Optimization and Analysis

Amplitude promotes a 6-step optimization workflow: critical event identification, usage interval determination, retention analysis, lifecycle graphing, persona mapping, and engagement matrix analysis, followed by ongoing cohort comparison and A/B testing.

The platform supports industry-specific event taxonomies across ecommerce, B2B/SaaS, finance, media, healthcare, and gaming sectors, with recommended events and properties tailored to common business questions in each vertical. Quality assurance processes include real-time event verification through User Activity tabs, monthly event limit handling, and sophisticated deduplication logic using event ID/client event time/device ID matching.
