# Amplitude Analytics Platform Overview

Amplitude is an event-based analytics platform that tracks and analyzes user behavior within digital products. The platform helps teams gain insights into user engagement, retention, and revenue by collecting and analyzing data about user actions (events), user characteristics, and product usage patterns.

## Key Features and Capabilities

### Core Analytics Features
- **Event-based tracking**: Captures user actions within products as discrete events
- **Real-time event stream**: Displays user activity as it happens
- **Chart creation and visualization**: Tools to build custom analytics views
- **Template Gallery**: Pre-built analysis templates for common use cases
- **Dashboard customization**: Create and share custom dashboards
- **A/B testing analysis**: Compare experiment variations
- **User identification**: Cross-device user tracking and identity resolution
- **Session Replay**: Records user interactions for playback and analysis
- **Autocapture**: Automatically collects user interactions with minimal coding

### Analysis Templates
Amplitude provides pre-built templates for common analytics needs:
- **User Activity Report**: Tracks engagement metrics (DAU, session length, user breakdowns)
- **Conversion Report**: Analyzes funnel conversion rates and drop-off points
- **Feature Adoption Report**: Measures feature adoption and engagement
- **Ecommerce Report**: Analyzes acquisition channels and purchase behavior
- **A/B Test View**: Compares metrics between experiment groups

## Product Architecture and Relationships

### Organizational Structure
- **Organizations**: Top-level entities containing projects and users
- **Projects**: Containers for data related to specific products or app sections
  - Each project has its own API key for data transmission
  - Projects can be configured for cross-platform or separate platform tracking

### Content Organization
- **Spaces**: Collaborative areas for teams to organize and share analyses
  - **Personal workspace**: Private area for individual work
  - **Shared spaces**: Team collaboration areas with permission controls
  - Space limitations vary by plan (1 for Starter, 3 for Plus, unlimited for higher tiers)
- **Folders**: Hierarchical organization within spaces

### User Identification System
- **Device ID**: Identifies unique devices
- **Amplitude ID**: Amplitude's internal user identifier
- **User ID**: Optional customer-provided identifier for cross-device tracking
- Identity resolution merges user activity across devices when user IDs are provided

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Analytics Concepts
- **Events**: User actions tracked in the system (page views, clicks, purchases)
- **Event properties**: Additional context about events (item price, page URL)
- **User properties**: Attributes of users that persist across sessions (plan type, demographics)
- **Sessions**: Periods of continuous user activity
- **Behavioral cohort**: Group of users who performed specific actions
- **Monthly tracked user (MTU)**: Unique user tracked within a month (billing metric)
- **Retention**: Measure of users returning to the product over time
- **Stickiness**: Frequency of user engagement within a time period
- **Funnel analysis**: Tracking user progression through a sequence of events

### Automatically Tracked Properties
- **Event properties**: Page domain, URL, location, referrer, session replay ID
- **User properties**: Location (country, region, city), device type, platform, OS

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Analytics integrates with:
- **Amplitude Session Replay**: Records user sessions for visual playback
- **Amplitude Experiment**: A/B testing platform with direct results analysis
- Various third-party data sources and destinations through integrations

The platform is designed to scale from simple analytics needs to complex, enterprise-wide implementations, with different plan tiers offering varying levels of features, data volume, and organizational capabilities.

## Technical Implementation

### SDK Implementation
```html
<!-- Basic Amplitude snippet -->
<script type="text/javascript">
  !function(){var e=window.amplitude||{_q:[],_iq:{}};/* initialization code */}();
  amplitude.init("YOUR_API_KEY");
</script>
```

### Key APIs
- **Identify API**: Update user properties
- **HTTP API v2**: Send events server-side
- **Batch API**: Send multiple events in one request
- **Dashboard REST API**: Programmatically access dashboards
- **Export API**: Extract raw data

### Data Collection Methods
- **Client-side SDKs**: Browser, iOS-Swift, Android-Kotlin
- **Server-side APIs**: HTTP API v2, Batch API
- **Integrations**: Third-party data sources
- **Autocapture**: Automatic collection of interactions, page views, and forms

### Implementation Process
1. Create an account and project
2. Plan implementation (define goals, user identification strategy, event taxonomy)
3. Implement data collection (install SDK, set up user identification, configure event tracking)
4. Verify implementation (check tracked events, monitor event limits)

Amplitude's recommended workflow for product optimization includes identifying critical events, analyzing retention patterns, mapping user lifecycle stages, identifying user personas, creating engagement matrices, and conducting ongoing cohort analysis and A/B testing.
