Amplitude is a comprehensive event-based product analytics platform that enables businesses to understand user behavior, optimize engagement, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform provides real-time tracking of user interactions across web, mobile, and cross-platform applications, supporting teams in analyzing user journeys, measuring feature adoption, and optimizing conversion rates.

## Product Architecture and Core Features

Amplitude's architecture is built around several interconnected components that deliver a complete analytics solution:

**Analytics Dashboard and Home Page**: The Amplitude Home page functions as the central command center, offering product overview metrics, real-time event streams, quick chart creation through Event Segmentation, and access to the template gallery. Users can create charts via the Create > Chart menu, with plan-specific limitations (Starter plans are restricted to 10 charts and 1-year data queries).

**Data Collection and SDKs**: The platform supports multiple data ingestion methods including Browser SDK (2.10.0+), iOS Swift SDK, Android Kotlin SDK, and various APIs. The Browser SDK can be initialized through JavaScript snippet implementation, featuring Session Replay integration and Autocapture capabilities for automatic event tracking.

**Spaces and Organization**: Amplitude utilizes Spaces for content organization and team collaboration, supporting both personal workspaces and shared spaces. Plan restrictions apply (Starter: 1 space, Plus: 3 spaces, unlimited for higher-tier plans).

**Template System**: Pre-built templates are accessible through the Template Gallery, including Ecommerce Report, Feature Adoption Report, Conversion Report, and User Activity Report templates that can be converted into customizable dashboards.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

The platform's features work synergistically to create a cohesive analytics ecosystem. The Analytics Dashboard serves as the primary interface where users interact with data collected through various SDKs and APIs. Spaces provide organizational structure for teams to collaborate on analytics projects, while the Template System accelerates implementation by providing industry-standard analytics frameworks.

Data flows from collection points (SDKs, APIs) through the platform's processing engine to visualization tools (charts, dashboards) and analysis features (cohorts, retention analysis). The Session Replay feature integrates directly with event tracking to provide visual context for user behavior data.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**User Identification System**:
- **Amplitude ID**: Platform-generated unique identifier for users
- **Device ID**: Platform-specific identifiers (IDFV for iOS, Advertising Identifier)
- **User ID**: Custom identifier assigned by applications for cross-device tracking

**Event Tracking**:
- **Events**: User actions tracked with verb+noun naming conventions (limited to 20 properties maximum)
- **Event Properties**: Contextual data associated with specific events
- **User Properties**: Persistent characteristics associated with users
- **Inactive Events**: Events that don't count toward Monthly Tracked Users (MTU)

**Session Management**:
- **Session Timeout**: 5 minutes for mobile, 30 minutes for web
- **Session ID**: Milliseconds since epoch UTC timestamp

**Analytics Concepts**:
- **Active Users**: Users who trigger any event within a specified timeframe
- **Monthly Tracked Users (MTU)**: Billing metric for unique users per month
- **Retention**: Percentage of users returning after initial engagement
- **Stickiness**: Ratio of daily active users to monthly active users
- **Behavioral Cohorts**: User segments based on shared behaviors

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates into broader product ecosystems through multiple organizational and technical touchpoints:

**Development Integration**: Teams organize around three critical roles - Project Lead (coordinates adoption), Data Governor (designs tracking plans), and Instrumentation Lead (implements SDK events). The platform supports both cross-platform instrumentation (same API key across platforms) and separate platform strategies.

**Data Sources**: Integration supports client-side SDKs, server-side APIs, third-party data sources, CSV uploads, and Chrome extensions. The HTTP API v2 provides server endpoint capabilities with deduplication logic using event ID/client event time/device ID matching.

**Privacy and Compliance**: Built-in support for GDPR/CNIL compliance, consent management platforms, cookie management (AMP_ prefixed cookies), and opt-out mechanisms through the legacy JavaScript SDK.

**Analytics Workflow**: The platform supports a 6-step optimization workflow covering critical event identification, usage interval determination, retention analysis, lifecycle graphing, persona mapping, and engagement matrix analysis.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Key APIs**:
- **HTTP API v2**: Primary server-side data ingestion endpoint
- **Identify API**: User property management and updates
- **Dashboard REST API**: Programmatic dashboard management
- **Export API**: JSON file data extraction
- **Attribution API**: Campaign attribution data
- **Behavioral Cohorts API**: Segment management

**SDK Implementation**:
- Browser SDK initialization: `amplitude.init()` with API key configuration
- Autocapture configuration: `elementInteractions` setting for automatic tracking
- Session Replay integration with sampling rate configuration

**Automatic Event Tracking**:
- Page-viewed events with properties: Page Domain, Page Location, Page Path, Page Title, Page URL, Page Counter
- Element interactions: Element clicked, Form started/submitted
- Application lifecycle events for mobile platforms
- Marketing attribution capture with UTM parameters

**Data Management**:
- Event deduplication with 7-day insert_id retention
- Real-time event verification through User Activity tab
- Monthly event limits with data accessibility restrictions
- Cross-domain tracking capabilities

The platform emphasizes data taxonomy planning through spreadsheet templates, event naming conventions, and pre-instrumentation workflow organization to ensure clean, actionable analytics implementation across teams and use cases.
