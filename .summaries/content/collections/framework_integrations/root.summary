## Amplitude Framework Integrations

Amplitude Framework Integrations is a specialized documentation collection that provides comprehensive SDK integration guidance for modern web development frameworks. The product enables developers to seamlessly implement Amplitude's analytics and user behavior tracking capabilities within popular framework-based applications, supporting both client-side and server-side tracking architectures.

## Product Relationships and Feature Architecture

The framework integrations function as implementation bridges between Amplitude's core SDK ecosystem and specific development frameworks. The architecture supports multiple integration patterns through three primary SDK packages:

**Core SDK Components:**
- **@amplitude/unified**: Primary unified SDK package providing a single interface for both client and server-side analytics
- **@amplitude/analytics-browser**: Specialized browser-side analytics package for client-side tracking
- **@amplitude/analytics-node**: Server-side analytics package for backend event tracking

**Integration Patterns:**
The framework integrations support hybrid implementation architectures where client-side and server-side tracking coexist within the same application. This leverages framework-specific features including routing systems, middleware integration, and environment variable management to provide comprehensive analytics coverage.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**SDK Package Taxonomy:**
- **Unified SDK**: Comprehensive package (@amplitude/unified) combining browser and server-side capabilities
- **Browser SDK**: Client-side focused package (@amplitude/analytics-browser) for frontend event tracking
- **Node SDK**: Server-side package (@amplitude/analytics-node) for backend analytics implementation

**Framework-Specific Terminology:**
- **App Router**: Next.js 13+ routing system requiring specific client/server component implementation considerations
- **Pages Router**: Legacy Next.js routing system with distinct implementation patterns
- **Client-side Configuration**: Browser-based SDK initialization and event tracking setup
- **Server-side Configuration**: Backend SDK configuration for server-rendered applications

**Analytics Feature Capabilities:**
- **Autocapture**: Automated tracking of user interactions including pageViews and elementInteractions
- **Session Replay**: User session recording and playback functionality for behavior analysis
- **Visual Labeling**: Chrome Extension-based tool enabling visual event configuration without code changes
- **User Identification**: setUserId functionality for associating events with specific user identities
- **Session Management**: reset capabilities for managing user session lifecycles

**Configuration Components:**
- **Environment Variables**: Framework-specific variable management (e.g., NEXT_PUBLIC_AMPLITUDE_API_KEY)
- **Middleware Integration**: Framework routing middleware for seamless analytics integration
- **Debug Configuration**: logLevel settings for development troubleshooting and monitoring

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The framework integrations serve as a critical implementation layer within Amplitude's comprehensive analytics ecosystem, connecting multiple system components:

**Development Workflow Integration:**
The integrations bridge modern web development frameworks with their specific architectural patterns, supporting TypeScript and JavaScript environments while accommodating client-server hybrid application architectures.

**Analytics Platform Connectivity:**
- Core Amplitude analytics platform for event ingestion, processing, and analysis
- Session Replay infrastructure providing user behavior recording and analysis capabilities
- Visual Labeling tools enabling non-technical team members to configure event tracking
- User identification and session management systems for comprehensive user journey tracking

**Technical Implementation Architecture:**
The framework integrations address framework-specific technical challenges including server-side rendering considerations, environment variable management, browser availability validation (handling window undefined scenarios), and proper SDK initialization timing within framework lifecycles.

The product enables developers to maintain their preferred development patterns and framework-specific best practices while gaining access to Amplitude's full analytics capabilities, supporting implementations ranging from simple client-side tracking to complex hybrid architectures utilizing both browser and server-side analytics collection.
