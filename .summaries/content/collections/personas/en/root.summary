# Amplitude Personas: Behavioral Clustering for User Segmentation

## Product Overview

Amplitude Personas is an advanced analytics feature that automatically groups users into clusters based on their behavioral similarities. Unlike traditional segmentation that requires predefined rules, Personas uses machine learning to discover natural user groupings through exploratory data mining. This feature helps product teams identify distinct user personas based on actual behavior patterns rather than assumptions.

## Key Features and Concepts

- **Behavioral Clustering**: Automatically groups users with similar event behaviors without requiring predefined rules
- **Cluster Analysis**: Identifies distinct user personas based on behavioral patterns in your product
- **Exploratory Data Mining**: Discovers unexpected user segments that might not be apparent through traditional analysis
- **Cohort Segmentation**: Creates targetable cohorts from discovered personas for further analysis or marketing

## Product Architecture and Components

Personas uses a specialized interface that differs from standard Amplitude charts, consisting of three main modules:

1. **Cluster Generation Module**: Controls the clustering algorithm parameters
2. **Cluster Count Module**: Displays the number of users in each identified cluster
3. **Target Cohort Module**: Allows selection of specific user groups for clustering analysis

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Cluster Cards**: Visual representations of each identified persona showing key metrics and behavioral patterns
- **Event Table**: Displays event frequency data for each cluster, highlighting behavioral differences
- **Standard Deviation**: Measures how much a cluster's event frequency differs from the average
- **Hidden Events**: Events with minimal variation across clusters that can be hidden to focus on distinguishing behaviors

## Interpretation and Usage

Users can interpret Personas charts by:
- Analyzing cluster metrics to understand the size and significance of each persona
- Sorting event data to identify the most distinguishing behaviors
- Naming personas based on their distinctive behavioral patterns
- Creating behavioral cohorts from identified personas for targeted analysis

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Personas is positioned as an advanced analytics feature within the Amplitude platform, available exclusively to customers on Growth and Enterprise plans. It complements other Amplitude features by:

- Providing input for more targeted cohort analysis
- Informing product development decisions based on discovered user behaviors
- Supporting marketing segmentation with behaviorally-defined personas

## Usage Requirements

- Available only on Amplitude Growth and Enterprise plans
- Requires sufficient user behavior data to identify meaningful clusters
- Works with existing Amplitude event tracking implementation

Personas represents a data-driven approach to user segmentation that moves beyond demographic or rule-based methods to discover authentic behavioral patterns within a product's user base.
