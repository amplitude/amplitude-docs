## Personas: Behavioral User Clustering and Analysis

Personas is an advanced analytics feature that leverages unsupervised machine learning to automatically discover user segments based on behavioral patterns. Unlike traditional segmentation that requires predefined rules, Personas uses clustering algorithms to identify natural groupings of users with similar event interaction behaviors. The feature is available on Growth and Enterprise plans and analyzes user behavior within a 30-day timeframe, processing up to the top 100 events from your tracking plan.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

Personas operates through a specialized three-module architecture that diverges from standard Event/Segmentation analytics modules:

The **Cluster Generation Module** serves as the analytical engine, executing unsupervised clustering algorithms to identify behavioral patterns and group users with similar event interaction profiles. This module processes event data to determine optimal user groupings based on behavioral similarities.

The **Cluster Count Module** manages the optimization of cluster quantities, balancing the need for granular insights with meaningful differentiation between user groups. This ensures that the resulting segments are both statistically significant and practically actionable.

The **Target Cohort Module** defines the user population scope for analysis, supporting new users, active users, and custom retention-based cohorts. This module provides particular integration with retention cohorts for longitudinal behavioral analysis.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Behavioral Clusters** are automatically generated user groups identified through unsupervised machine learning algorithms based on event behavior similarities.

**Target Cohort** refers to the specific user population selected for clustering analysis, which can be filtered to focus on new users, active users, or custom retention-based segments.

**Behavioral Cohort** represents the resulting user segments that can be exported for further analysis or activation in other platform components.

**Cluster Cards** are visual representations of each identified user segment, displayed in bubble chart format showing key metrics and characteristics.

**Event Table Analysis** provides a dual-section analytical view that separates events occurring above average frequency from those below average frequency for each cluster.

**Standard Deviation Metrics** are statistical measurements quantifying how significantly each cluster's event behavior deviates from the overall population average.

## Interpretation and Analysis Framework

The Personas interface centers on cluster bubble charts that visualize user segments by size and target cohort percentage. Each cluster card displays user count, relative size within the target cohort, target cohort percentage representation, and provides behavioral cohort export functionality with cluster sorting capabilities.

The event table analysis delivers granular behavioral insights through a bifurcated view showing above-average and below-average event frequencies. This enables analysts to identify distinguishing behavioral patterns that define each persona. The system automatically filters out events from the tracking plan that don't contribute meaningfully to cluster differentiation, focusing attention on behaviorally significant patterns.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Personas integrates with the analytics ecosystem through behavioral cohort exports, enabling discovered user segments to be utilized across other analytical tools and activation platforms. The feature connects with retention analysis capabilities and leverages existing event tracking infrastructure while providing a complementary approach to traditional rule-based segmentation methods.

The clustering analysis supports exploratory data mining workflows, enabling product teams to discover unexpected user behavioral patterns that may not be apparent through conventional segmentation approaches. This capability informs product development decisions, marketing strategies, and user experience optimization initiatives by revealing natural user behavior patterns that emerge from actual usage data rather than predetermined assumptions.
