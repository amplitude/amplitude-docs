# Amplitude Python SDK Product Overview

## Product Overview

The Amplitude Python SDK is a comprehensive analytics tracking library that enables developers to implement event tracking in Python applications. The SDK provides two main components: the core Python SDK and the Ampli wrapper, which offers strongly-typed analytics event tracking.

## Key Features and Capabilities

### Core Python SDK
- Event tracking with custom properties
- User identification and property management
- Group identification and property management
- Revenue tracking
- Configurable event batching and flushing
- Plugin architecture for extending functionality
- Event enrichment capabilities
- Multiple destination support

### Ampli Wrapper
- Strongly-typed analytics event tracking
- Type-safe implementation of tracking plans
- Code generation through the Ampli CLI
- Simplified event validation

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Amplitude Python SDK ecosystem consists of two main components that work together:

1. **Core Python SDK (`amplitude-analytics`)**: The foundation library that handles the core functionality of tracking events, managing user properties, and sending data to Amplitude's servers.

2. **Ampli Wrapper**: A higher-level abstraction built on top of the core SDK that provides strongly-typed event tracking based on a tracking plan defined in Amplitude.

The relationship between these components is hierarchical:
- The Ampli wrapper depends on and utilizes the core SDK
- Ampli provides type safety and validation on top of the core SDK's functionality
- Both components ultimately send data to Amplitude's analytics platform

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: An action that a user performs in an application
- **User Properties**: Attributes associated with a user that persist across sessions
- **Identify**: Operations that set or modify user properties without sending an event
- **Group**: A collection of users that can have their own properties
- **Tracking Plan**: A schema that defines the expected structure of events and properties
- **Ampli**: The strongly-typed wrapper generated from a tracking plan
- **Plugins**: Extensions that can modify events or send them to additional destinations
- **Flush**: The process of sending batched events to Amplitude's servers
- **LoadOptions**: Configuration options for initializing the Ampli wrapper
- **EventOptions**: Additional options that can be passed when tracking events

## Implementation Details

### Core SDK Installation and Initialization

```python
pip install amplitude-analytics

from amplitude import Amplitude

amplitude = Amplitude("API_KEY")
amplitude.configuration.flush_queue_size = 10
amplitude.configuration.flush_interval_millis = 10000
```

### Core SDK Event Tracking

```python
# Track basic event
amplitude.track(
    "event_type",
    event_properties={"property1": "value1"},
    user_id="user_id"
)

# Identify user properties
identify = amplitude.Identify()
identify.set("user_property", "value")
amplitude.identify(identify, user_id="user_id")

# Group identify
group_identify = amplitude.Identify()
group_identify.set("group_property", "value")
amplitude.group_identify("group_type", "group_name", group_identify)

# Track revenue
revenue = amplitude.Revenue()
revenue.price = 3.99
revenue.quantity = 3
amplitude.revenue(revenue, user_id="user_id")
```

### Ampli Wrapper Installation and Initialization

```python
pip install amplitude-analytics

from ampli import Ampli

ampli = Ampli()
ampli.load(LoadOptions(api_key="API_KEY"))
```

### Ampli Event Tracking

```python
# Identify a user
ampli.identify("user_id", Identify().set("user_property", "value"))

# Track an event (strongly-typed)
ampli.song_played("user_id", 
    SongPlayed(song_id="song-1", title="Song Title")
)

# Set a group
ampli.set_group("user_id", "group_type", "group_name")

# Group identify
ampli.group_identify("group_type", "group_name", 
    Identify().set("group_property", "value")
)
```

### Event Flushing

Both the core SDK and Ampli wrapper support manual and automatic event flushing:

```python
# Manual flush
amplitude.flush()
ampli.flush()

# Shutdown (flushes events and stops background processes)
amplitude.shutdown()
ampli.shutdown()
```

## Plugin Architecture

The Python SDK supports plugins for event enrichment and sending events to additional destinations:

```python
# Adding a plugin
amplitude.add_plugin(plugin)
```

Types of plugins:
- Event enrichment plugins: Modify events before they're sent
- Destination plugins: Send events to additional destinations beyond Amplitude

## CLI Commands for Ampli

The Ampli CLI provides commands for generating the strongly-typed wrapper:

```bash
ampli pull
ampli status
ampli pull --update
```

These commands fetch the tracking plan from Amplitude and generate the corresponding Python code for the Ampli wrapper.
