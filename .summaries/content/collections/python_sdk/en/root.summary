# Amplitude Python SDK Product Overview

The Amplitude Python SDK is a comprehensive analytics tracking solution for Python applications (3.6+) that enables developers to capture and analyze user behavior data. The SDK consists of two main components: the core Python SDK and the Ampli wrapper, which provides strongly-typed event tracking based on a tracking plan.

## Key Features and Concepts

- **Event Tracking**: Capture user interactions and custom events in Python applications
- **User Identity Management**: Track individual users across sessions and platforms
- **User Properties**: Store and update attributes about users
- **Group Analytics**: Track and analyze user groups and their properties
- **Revenue Tracking**: Monitor purchase events and revenue metrics
- **Strongly-typed Events**: Use the Ampli wrapper for type-safe event tracking
- **Batching and Queuing**: Configure how events are buffered and sent to Amplitude
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extend functionality through custom plugins

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Python SDK ecosystem consists of two main components that work together:

1. **Core Python SDK (`amplitude-analytics`)**: The foundation library that handles event tracking, user management, and communication with Amplitude's servers.

2. **Ampli Wrapper**: A code-generated layer that sits on top of the core SDK, providing strongly-typed event tracking based on a tracking plan defined in Amplitude.

The relationship between these components is hierarchical:
- The Ampli wrapper depends on and utilizes the core SDK
- Developers can use either the core SDK directly for flexible tracking or the Ampli wrapper for type-safe tracking
- The Ampli wrapper is generated using the Ampli CLI, which pulls tracking plan definitions from Amplitude

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: A discrete user action or occurrence tracked in the system
- **Identify**: Operations that set or update user properties
- **User Properties**: Attributes associated with a specific user
- **Group**: A collection of users that can be analyzed together
- **Group Properties**: Attributes associated with a specific group
- **Tracking Plan**: A schema that defines expected events and their properties
- **Ampli CLI**: Command-line tool for generating the Ampli wrapper from a tracking plan
- **LoadOptions**: Configuration options when initializing the Ampli wrapper
- **EventOptions**: Additional options when tracking events
- **Plugins**: Extensions that can modify events or add functionality to the SDK

## Integration with Amplitude Ecosystem

The Python SDK integrates with the broader Amplitude product ecosystem in several ways:

1. **Amplitude Dashboard**: Events tracked via the SDK appear in the Amplitude analytics dashboard for analysis
2. **Tracking Plan**: The Ampli wrapper connects to tracking plans defined in Amplitude Data
3. **Cross-Platform Tracking**: Works alongside other Amplitude SDKs to provide a unified view of user behavior across platforms
4. **Server-side Tracking**: Complements client-side SDKs by enabling server-side event tracking

## API and Usage Examples

### Core SDK Installation and Initialization
```python
pip install amplitude-analytics

from amplitude import Amplitude

amplitude = Amplitude("API_KEY")
amplitude.configuration.flush_queue_size = 10
amplitude.configuration.flush_interval_millis = 1000
```

### Event Tracking with Core SDK
```python
# Track basic event
amplitude.track(
    "event_type",
    user_id="user@example.com",
    event_properties={"property1": "value1"}
)

# Set user properties
identify = Identify()
identify.set("key1", "value1")
identify.add("counter", 1)
amplitude.identify(identify, user_id="user@example.com")
```

### Ampli Wrapper Usage
```python
# Install Ampli wrapper
pip install amplitude-analytics

# Initialize Ampli
from ampli import Ampli
ampli = Ampli()
ampli.load({"client_api_key": "API_KEY"})

# Track typed events
ampli.song_played(
    user_id="user@example.com",
    song_id="song-123",
    song_name="Bohemian Rhapsody"
)
```

### Ampli CLI Commands
```bash
# Check status of tracking plan
ampli status

# Pull latest tracking plan and generate wrapper
ampli pull
```

The Python SDK provides a flexible and powerful solution for tracking analytics in Python applications, with options for both type-safe and flexible event tracking depending on developer needs.
