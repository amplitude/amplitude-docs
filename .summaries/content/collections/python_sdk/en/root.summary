## Amplitude Python SDK

The Amplitude Python SDK is a comprehensive analytics solution for Python applications (3.6+) that enables event tracking and user analytics through Amplitude's platform. The SDK consists of two main components: the core Python SDK (`amplitude-analytics`) and the Ampli wrapper, which provides strongly-typed event tracking through code generation.

## Product Relationship and Architecture

The Python SDK ecosystem operates on two levels:

**Core SDK (`amplitude-analytics`)**: The foundational package that provides direct event tracking capabilities with flexible configuration options and a plugin-based architecture for extensibility.

**Ampli Wrapper**: A higher-level abstraction that generates strongly-typed event classes from Amplitude Data tracking plans, providing compile-time safety and better developer experience while leveraging the core SDK underneath.

The relationship follows a layered approach where Ampli acts as a type-safe interface generator that ultimately utilizes the core SDK's event transmission capabilities.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**BaseEvent**: The fundamental event structure used for tracking user actions and behaviors in the core SDK.

**Ampli**: The code generation wrapper that creates strongly-typed event classes from tracking plans defined in Amplitude Data.

**LoadOptions/LoadClientOptions**: Configuration objects used during Ampli initialization to specify SDK behavior and client settings.

**EventOptions**: Configuration parameters for individual events, including `device_id`, `user_id`, and other event-specific metadata.

**Identify Operations**: User property management system supporting operations like `set()`, `add()`, `append()`, `pre_insert()`, and `post_insert()` for updating user attributes.

**Revenue Interface**: Specialized tracking system for monetary transactions with fields like `product_id`, `revenue_type`, and revenue amounts.

**Plugin System**: Extensible architecture supporting `PluginType.ENRICHMENT` and `DestinationPlugin` for customizing event processing and routing.

**StorageProvider**: Abstraction layer for event persistence, with `InMemoryStorageProvider` as the default implementation.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Python SDK integrates into Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem through multiple touchpoints:

- **Amplitude Data**: Provides the source tracking plans that Ampli uses for code generation
- **Amplitude Analytics Platform**: Receives events through both batch API and httpapi endpoints
- **Multi-environment Support**: Handles different server zones and deployment configurations
- **Cross-platform Consistency**: Maintains API parity with other Amplitude SDKs while respecting Python conventions

## API Endpoints and CLI Commands

**CLI Commands (Ampli)**:
- `ampli pull`: Downloads and generates strongly-typed event classes from tracking plans
- `ampli status`: Verifies the current state and synchronization of generated code

**Core SDK Methods**:
- `track()`: Primary event tracking method accepting BaseEvent objects
- `identify()`: Updates user properties using Identify operations
- `group_identify()`: Manages group-level properties and associations
- `set_group()`: Associates users with specific groups using `group_type` and `group_name`
- `flush()`: Forces immediate transmission of queued events

**Configuration Parameters**:
- `flush_queue_size`: Controls batch size for event transmission
- `flush_interval_millis`: Sets automatic flush timing intervals
- `flush_max_retries`: Defines retry behavior for failed transmissions
- `use_batch`: Toggles between batch API and individual event transmission
- `server_zone`: Specifies geographic routing for data residency requirements

The SDK supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations with callback functions for handling transmission results and error states, making it suitable for various Python application architectures from simple scripts to complex web applications.
