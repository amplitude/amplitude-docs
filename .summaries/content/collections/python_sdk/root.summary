# Amplitude Python SDK Product Overview

The Amplitude Python SDK is a comprehensive analytics tracking solution for Python applications that enables developers to track user behavior, manage user properties, and analyze event data. The SDK consists of two main components: the core Python SDK and the Ampli wrapper, which provides strongly-typed event tracking based on a tracking plan.

## Key Features and Concepts

1. **Event Tracking**: Capture user interactions and custom events in Python applications
2. **User Identification**: Associate events with specific users and manage user properties
3. **User Groups**: Organize users into groups and track group-level properties
4. **Revenue Tracking**: Monitor revenue-generating events and transactions
5. **Strongly-Typed Analytics**: Use the Ampli wrapper for type-safe event tracking based on a defined tracking plan
6. **Event Batching**: Configure how events are batched and sent to Amplitude servers
7. **Plugins System**: Extend functionality through custom plugins
8. **Multiple Server Zones**: Support for different geographic server deployments

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Python SDK ecosystem consists of two main components that work together:

1. **Core Python SDK (`amplitude-analytics`)**: The foundation library that handles event tracking, user management, and communication with Amplitude servers.

2. **Ampli Wrapper**: A higher-level abstraction built on top of the core SDK that provides strongly-typed event tracking based on a tracking plan defined in Amplitude.

The relationship between these components is hierarchical:
- The Ampli wrapper depends on and uses the core SDK
- The Ampli wrapper provides type safety and validation on top of the core SDK's functionality
- Both components ultimately send data to Amplitude's analytics backend

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Amplitude Client**: The main interface for interacting with the SDK, initialized with an API key
- **Event**: A user action or occurrence that is tracked, containing properties and metadata
- **Identify**: Operations that update user properties without sending an event
- **User Properties**: Attributes associated with a specific user
- **Group**: A collection of users, such as a company or organization
- **Group Properties**: Attributes associated with a specific group
- **Tracking Plan**: A schema that defines the structure of events and their properties
- **Plugins**: Extensions that can modify events or add functionality to the SDK
- **Flush**: The process of sending batched events to Amplitude servers
- **Server Zone**: Geographic region where Amplitude servers are located (US or EU)

## Integration with Broader Amplitude Ecosystem

The Python SDK integrates with several other Amplitude products and features:

1. **Amplitude Dashboard**: Events tracked via the SDK appear in the Amplitude analytics dashboard for analysis
2. **Tracking Plan**: The Ampli wrapper uses tracking plans defined in Amplitude to ensure consistent event tracking
3. **Amplitude CLI**: Used to generate the Ampli wrapper code based on the tracking plan
4. **Data Destinations**: Events can be forwarded to other tools in the Amplitude ecosystem

## API and Implementation Details

### Core SDK Installation and Initialization

```python
pip install amplitude-analytics

from amplitude import Amplitude

amplitude = Amplitude("API_KEY")
amplitude.configuration.flush_queue_size = 10
amplitude.configuration.flush_interval_millis = 10000
```

### Core SDK Event Tracking

```python
# Track basic event
amplitude.track(
    "event_type", 
    user_id="user_id", 
    device_id="device_id", 
    event_properties={"property": "value"}
)

# Identify user properties
identify = amplitude.Identify()
identify.set("key", "value")
identify.add("counter", 1)
amplitude.identify(identify, user_id="user_id")

# Track revenue
revenue = amplitude.Revenue()
revenue.price = 3.99
revenue.quantity = 2
amplitude.revenue(revenue, user_id="user_id")
```

### Ampli Wrapper Installation and Usage

```python
pip install amplitude-analytics

# Initialize Ampli
from ampli import Ampli
ampli = Ampli()
ampli.load(environment="production")

# Track events with type safety
ampli.song_played(
    user_id="user_id",
    song_id="song-1",
    song_name="Bohemian Rhapsody"
)

# Identify users
ampli.identify(
    user_id="user_id",
    user_properties={
        "plan_type": "premium"
    }
)
```

### Ampli CLI Commands

```bash
ampli pull
ampli status
ampli pull --update
```
