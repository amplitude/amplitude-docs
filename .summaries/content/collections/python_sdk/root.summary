## Amplitude Python SDK

The Amplitude Python SDK is a comprehensive analytics tracking solution that enables Python applications to send events and user data to Amplitude's analytics platform. The SDK supports Python 3.6+ and provides both a core SDK and an enhanced Ampli wrapper for type-safe event tracking.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Python SDK ecosystem consists of two complementary components:

**Core Python SDK (`amplitude-analytics`)**: The foundational package that provides direct event tracking capabilities, user management, and flexible configuration options. It handles the low-level communication with Amplitude's servers and provides essential features like batching, retries, and plugin architecture.

**Ampli Wrapper**: A code generation layer that sits on top of the core SDK, creating strongly-typed tracking libraries from Amplitude Data tracking plans. This wrapper transforms schema definitions into Python classes with compile-time type safety and IDE autocomplete support.

The relationship is hierarchical - Ampli generates code that utilizes the core SDK's functionality while adding type safety and plan validation on top.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events and Tracking**:
- `BaseEvent`: Core event structure for tracking user actions
- `EventOptions`: Configuration object containing `user_id`, `device_id`, and other event-level settings
- `SongPlayed`: Example of generated event classes from tracking plans

**User Management**:
- `Identify`: Operations for setting user properties (`set()`, `add()`, `remove()`, etc.)
- `user_id`: Primary user identifier
- `device_id`: Device-specific identifier for anonymous tracking

**Group Analytics**:
- `set_group()`: Associates users with groups using `group_type` and `group_name`
- `group_identify()`: Sets properties on user groups
- `group_type`: Category of group (e.g., "company", "team")

**Revenue Tracking**:
- `Revenue`: Interface for tracking monetary transactions
- `product_id`: Identifier for purchased items
- `revenue_type`: Classification of revenue events

**Configuration Parameters**:
- `flush_queue_size`: Number of events to batch before sending
- `flush_interval_millis`: Time interval for automatic queue flushing
- `flush_max_retries`: Maximum retry attempts for failed requests
- `server_zone`: Geographic server selection (US/EU)
- `use_batch`: Boolean for batch vs individual event sending

**Plugin Architecture**:
- `EventPlugin`: For event enrichment and transformation
- `DestinationPlugin`: For routing events to different endpoints
- `PluginType.ENRICHMENT`: Plugin category for data enhancement
- `timeline.process`: Event processing pipeline

**Storage Options**:
- `StorageProvider`: Interface for event persistence
- `InMemoryStorageProvider`: Default in-memory storage implementation

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The Python SDK integrates into Amplitude's comprehensive analytics ecosystem through several touchpoints:

**Amplitude Data Integration**: The Ampli wrapper connects directly to Amplitude Data's tracking plan management system, enabling schema-driven development where data governance and type safety are enforced at the code level.

**Multi-Platform Consistency**: The SDK follows Amplitude's cross-platform patterns, sharing nomenclature and concepts with iOS, Android, JavaScript, and other SDK implementations, ensuring consistent analytics implementation across technology stacks.

**Server-Side Architecture**: The SDK is designed for server-side Python applications, complementing client-side SDKs by providing backend event tracking, user property management, and revenue attribution.

## API Endpoints and CLI Commands

**Installation Commands**:
```bash
pip install amplitude-analytics  # Core SDK
npm install -g @amplitude/ampli  # CLI tool
```

**CLI Operations**:
- `ampli pull`: Downloads and generates tracking code from Amplitude Data
- `ampli status`: Verifies implementation against tracking plan

**Core SDK Methods**:
- `client.track()`: Send events with BaseEvent objects
- `client.identify()`: Update user properties
- `client.group_identify()`: Set group properties  
- `client.set_group()`: Associate users with groups
- `client.flush()`: Force immediate queue processing

**Ampli Wrapper Methods**:
- `ampli.identify()`: Type-safe user property updates
- `ampli.track()`: Strongly-typed event tracking
- `ampli.flush()`: Queue management
- Generated event methods (e.g., `ampli.song_played()`)

**Configuration Objects**:
- `LoadOptions`: Ampli initialization configuration
- `LoadClientOptions`: Client-specific settings for Ampli
- Plugin interfaces: `pre_insert`, `post_insert` for event pipeline customization

The SDK supports both synchronous and asynchronous operations, with automatic batching, retry logic, and flexible storage providers to accommodate various deployment scenarios from simple scripts to high-throughput production applications.
