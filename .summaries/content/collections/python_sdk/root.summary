# Amplitude Python SDK Product Overview

The Amplitude Python SDK is a comprehensive analytics tracking solution for Python applications that enables developers to capture user interactions, track custom events, and monitor user behavior. The SDK provides both a standard implementation and a strongly-typed approach through the Ampli wrapper.

## Key Features and Capabilities

- **Event Tracking**: Capture user interactions and custom events with detailed properties
- **User Identification**: Associate events with specific users through identity management
- **User Properties**: Track and update user attributes and characteristics over time
- **Group Analytics**: Associate users with organizations or other groupings for organizational-level analysis
- **Revenue Tracking**: Monitor purchase events and revenue metrics for business insights
- **Batching Configuration**: Control how and when events are sent to Amplitude servers
- **Type Safety**: Ensure correct event tracking through strongly-typed interfaces (via Ampli)
- **Implementation Verification**: Validate tracking implementation against specifications

## Product Architecture and Relationships

The Python SDK consists of two primary components:

1. **Core Python SDK (`amplitude-analytics`)**: The foundation library providing all core functionality for tracking events, managing users, and configuring the SDK.

2. **Ampli for Python SDK**: A wrapper built on top of the core SDK that provides strongly-typed interfaces generated from your tracking plan, ensuring type safety and implementation correctness.

The relationship between these components is hierarchical:
- Ampli depends on and utilizes the core SDK
- Ampli provides additional type safety and verification features
- Both components send data to the Amplitude analytics backend

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **BaseEvent**: The fundamental data structure representing an analytics event
- **Identify**: Operations that update user properties without sending events
- **EventOptions**: Configuration options applied to individual events
- **LoadOptions**: Configuration options applied during SDK initialization
- **Group**: A collection of users, such as an organization or team
- **Plugins**: Extensions that modify or enhance the SDK's functionality
- **Flush**: The process of sending batched events to Amplitude servers
- **Storage Provider**: Component responsible for storing events before sending
- **Server Zone**: Geographic region for data processing (US or EU)

## Integration with Amplitude Ecosystem

The Python SDK integrates with the broader Amplitude product ecosystem in several ways:

1. **Amplitude Dashboard**: Events tracked via the SDK appear in the Amplitude analytics dashboard for analysis
2. **Tracking Plan**: The Ampli wrapper is generated from tracking plans defined in Amplitude, ensuring consistency between specifications and implementation
3. **Ampli CLI**: Command-line tool that generates the strongly-typed Ampli wrapper based on your tracking plan
4. **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Works alongside other Amplitude SDKs (JavaScript, iOS, Android, etc.) to provide a unified analytics approach

## API and Usage Examples

### Core SDK Installation and Initialization
```python
pip install amplitude-analytics

from amplitude import Amplitude

amplitude = Amplitude("API_KEY")
amplitude.configuration.flush_queue_size = 10
amplitude.configuration.flush_interval_millis = 1000
```

### Event Tracking with Core SDK
```python
from amplitude import BaseEvent, EventOptions

amplitude.track(
    BaseEvent(
        event_type="Button Clicked",
        user_id="user@example.com",
        event_properties={"buttonColor": "blue"}
    ),
    EventOptions(user_properties={"premium": True})
)
```

### Ampli Installation and Initialization
```python
pip install amplitude-analytics

from ampli import Ampli, LoadOptions

ampli = Ampli()
ampli.load(LoadOptions(api_key="API_KEY"))
```

### Event Tracking with Ampli
```python
# Strongly-typed event tracking
ampli.song_played(
    song_id="song-1",
    song_name="Bohemian Rhapsody",
    options=EventOptions(user_id="user@example.com")
)
```

### User Identification
```python
# Core SDK
from amplitude import Identify
amplitude.identify(
    Identify(user_id="user@example.com"),
    EventOptions(user_properties={"plan": "premium"})
)

# Ampli
ampli.identify(
    user_id="user@example.com",
    device_id="device-id",
    user_properties={"plan": "premium"}
)
```

### Group Management
```python
# Set group
amplitude.set_group("org_id", "org-1")

# Group identify
amplitude.group_identify("org_id", "org-1", Identify().set("plan", "enterprise"))
```

### Flushing Events
```python
# Manually send events to Amplitude
amplitude.flush()
ampli.flush()
```
