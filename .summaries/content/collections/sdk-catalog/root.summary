# Amplitude SDK Catalog

## Product Overview

Amplitude's SDK Catalog provides a comprehensive suite of Software Development Kits enabling developers to integrate analytics capabilities across multiple platforms and programming languages. These SDKs facilitate the collection and analysis of user behavior data through event tracking, user identification, session management, and customizable data collection configurations.

## Key Features

- **Event Tracking**: Capture user interactions and custom events within applications
- **User Identification**: Track individual users across multiple sessions
- **Session Management**: Define and monitor user sessions with configurable timeouts
- **Batch Processing**: Configure event batching for optimized network usage
- **Offline Support**: Store events locally when offline with automatic sending upon reconnection
- **Custom Storage Providers**: Implement custom storage solutions for event data
- **Server Zone Configuration**: Specify data residency requirements (US, EU)
- **COPPA Compliance**: Special controls for applications used by children

## Platform and Language Support

Amplitude's SDK ecosystem spans across:

### Mobile Platforms
- Android (Java/Kotlin)
- iOS (Swift)
- React Native
- Flutter

### Web Platforms
- Browser (JavaScript)

### Server-Side Languages
- Node.js (JavaScript/TypeScript)
- Python
- JRE Java
- Go

### Game Development
- Unity
- Unreal Engine

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **flushIntervalMillis**: Time interval between automatic event batch uploads
- **flushQueueSize**: Event threshold that triggers automatic upload
- **deviceId**: Unique identifier for the device using the application
- **userId**: Unique identifier for the application user
- **sessionId**: Unique identifier for a user session
- **StorageProvider**: Interface for customizing local event storage
- **ServerZone**: Configuration option for data residency (US, EU)
- **COPPA**: Children's Online Privacy Protection Act compliance settings
- **Batch API**: Method for sending multiple events in a single network request
- **Offline mode**: Functionality for storing events during network unavailability

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The SDK Catalog functions as the data collection layer within Amplitude's broader analytics platform. These SDKs capture user events and transmit them to Amplitude's backend services where the data is processed and made available for analysis.

The collected data integrates with:
- Amplitude Analytics for visualization and reporting
- User identification and cohort analysis features
- A/B testing capabilities through Experiment
- Data management and governance tools

The SDKs serve as the foundation for Amplitude's data-driven product suite, enabling organizations to make informed decisions based on user behavior insights.

## Implementation Examples

Android SDK configuration example:

```kotlin
// Kotlin implementation
val config = Configuration(
    apiKey = "YOUR-API-KEY",
    flushIntervalMillis = 10000,
    flushQueueSize = 30,
    logLevel = LogLevel.DEBUG
)
Amplitude.init(applicationContext, config)
```

```java
// Java implementation
Configuration configuration = new Configuration(
    "YOUR-API-KEY",
    getApplicationContext()
);
configuration.setFlushIntervalMillis(10000);
configuration.setFlushQueueSize(30);
configuration.setLogLevel(LogLevel.DEBUG);
Amplitude.init(configuration);
```

All SDKs follow similar initialization patterns with platform-specific configuration options, followed by consistent methods for event tracking and user identification.
