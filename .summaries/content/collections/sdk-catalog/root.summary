# Amplitude SDK Catalog

## Overview

Amplitude's SDK Catalog provides cross-platform analytics and event tracking capabilities for applications. The SDKs enable developers to collect user behavior data for insights into engagement, retention, and conversion. Core capabilities include event tracking, user identification, session management, batch processing, and offline data collection.

## Product Relationships and Features

The SDK ecosystem is organized by platform type:

### Mobile Platforms
- **Android SDK**: Event tracking for Android with Kotlin/Java support
- **iOS SDK**: Analytics integration for iOS using Swift
- **React Native SDK**: Cross-platform solution for React Native
- **Flutter SDK**: Cross-platform solution for Flutter

### Web Platforms
- **Browser SDK**: JavaScript-based SDK for web applications

### Backend/Server Platforms
- **Node.js SDK**: For server-side JavaScript applications
- **Python SDK**: For Python-based backend services
- **Go SDK**: For Go-based backend services
- **JRE Java SDK**: For Java-based backend services

### Game Development Platforms
- **Unity SDK**: For Unity-built games and applications
- **Unreal Engine SDK**: For Unreal Engine-built games and applications

All SDKs maintain consistent core functionality while providing platform-specific implementations.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event Tracking**: Recording of user actions and behaviors
- **Configuration Options**: Settings controlling SDK behavior
- **Batch Processing**: Grouping multiple events before transmission
  - **flushIntervalMillis**: Time interval between batch uploads
  - **flushQueueSize**: Event count threshold for automatic upload
- **Device ID Management**: Methods for unique device identification
- **Session Tracking**: Monitoring of user engagement periods
- **Offline Mode**: Local event storage when network is unavailable
- **StorageProvider**: Interface for customizing local event storage
- **ServerZone**: Geographic region configuration for data compliance

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The SDK catalog functions as the data collection layer within Amplitude's analytics platform. SDKs feed data into Amplitude's analytics dashboard and processing pipeline. The documentation structure indicates:

1. Platform-specific landing pages for each SDK
2. Categorization by platform type
3. Uniform connection to Amplitude backend services

Game development SDKs (Unity and Unreal) have specialized documentation paths ("/docs/sdks/analytics/unity/unity-sdk" and "/docs/sdks/analytics/unreal/unreal-sdk"), suggesting they may be part of a specialized analytics offering within the broader ecosystem.

## Implementation Details

The Android SDK documentation highlights several configuration options:
- Batch behavior controls (`flushIntervalMillis`, `flushQueueSize`)
- Device ID management functionality
- Session tracking configuration
- Network settings including offline mode

Each SDK maintains platform-specific implementations while ensuring consistent data collection across the entire ecosystem.
