# Amplitude SDK Catalog

## Product Overview

Amplitude's SDK Catalog provides a comprehensive suite of development kits that enable analytics tracking across diverse platforms and programming languages. These SDKs facilitate the integration of Amplitude's analytics capabilities into applications, allowing developers to track user behavior, manage sessions, and log events with precision.

The SDKs feature robust configuration options including event batching, device ID management, session tracking, customizable storage providers, and flexible network settings. They are designed to function seamlessly across mobile applications, web browsers, game engines, and server-side environments, providing a unified analytics solution regardless of platform.

## Product Relationships and Features

The SDK ecosystem is organized by platform type:

### Mobile Platforms
- **Android SDK**: Native implementation for Android applications with extensive configuration options
- **iOS SDK**: Native implementation for iOS/Swift applications
- **React Native SDK**: Cross-platform solution for React Native mobile applications
- **Flutter SDK**: Cross-platform solution for Flutter mobile applications

### Web Platforms
- **Browser SDK**: Implementation for web applications and websites

### Game Development
- **Unity SDK**: Integration for Unity game engine applications
- **Unreal Engine SDK**: Integration for Unreal Engine applications

### Server-Side/Backend
- **Node.js SDK**: Implementation for JavaScript/TypeScript server applications
- **Python SDK**: Implementation for Python applications
- **JRE Java SDK**: Implementation for Java applications
- **Go SDK**: Implementation for Go applications

While each SDK provides platform-specific implementations, they share core functionality for event tracking and analytics. The Android SDK documentation is particularly detailed, offering comprehensive configuration options for event tracking behaviors, batching mechanisms, device identification, session management, and storage customization.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

Based on the documentation, key terminology includes:

- **Event Tracking**: Core functionality for logging user actions and behaviors
- **flushIntervalMillis**: Time interval (in milliseconds) for batching and sending events
- **flushQueueSize**: Threshold number of events that triggers automatic sending
- **deviceId**: Unique identifier for tracking individual devices or users
- **Batch API**: System for sending multiple events in a single network request
- **Offline Mode**: Capability to store events locally during network unavailability
- **StorageProvider**: Interface for customizing local event storage implementation
- **Session Tracking**: System for grouping events into logical user sessions
- **COPPA Control**: Settings for compliance with Children's Online Privacy Protection Act
- **ServerZone**: Configuration option for data residency (US or EU servers)
- **Legacy Data Migration**: Process for transitioning data from previous SDK versions

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's SDKs function as the data collection layer within Amplitude's broader analytics platform. They:

1. Collect user event data across multiple platforms
2. Process and optimize this data for efficient transmission
3. Transmit data to Amplitude's analytics servers
4. Support offline functionality with local storage
5. Provide configuration options for regulatory compliance

The collected data feeds into Amplitude's analytics dashboard and reporting tools, enabling businesses to analyze user behavior, track conversion metrics, and optimize their applications. The SDKs support core Amplitude features including user identification, event property tracking, and session management.

## API Usage Examples

The Android SDK documentation provides implementation examples in both Kotlin and Java:

```kotlin
// Kotlin configuration example
val config = Configuration(
    apiKey = AMPLITUDE_API_KEY,
    flushIntervalMillis = 1000,
    flushQueueSize = 10
)
Amplitude.init(context, config)

// Event tracking
Amplitude.track("Button Clicked", mapOf("button_type" to "sign_up"))
```

```java
// Java configuration example
Configuration configuration = new Configuration(
    AMPLITUDE_API_KEY,
    getApplicationContext()
);
configuration.setFlushIntervalMillis(1000);
configuration.setFlushQueueSize(10);
Amplitude.init(configuration);

// Event tracking
Map<String, String> eventProperties = new HashMap<>();
eventProperties.put("button_type", "sign_up");
Amplitude.track("Button Clicked", eventProperties);
```

The SDKs interact with Amplitude's servers through configuration options including server zone selection (US or EU), batch API implementation for efficient data transmission, and customizable flush mechanisms that control when events are sent to servers.
