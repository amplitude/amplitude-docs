# Amplitude SDK Catalog

## Product Overview

Amplitude's SDK Catalog provides a comprehensive suite of Software Development Kits that enable developers to integrate analytics capabilities into applications across multiple platforms. These SDKs facilitate the collection and analysis of user behavior data through event tracking, user identification, session management, and customizable data collection configurations.

## Product Relationships and Features

The SDK Catalog consists of platform-specific SDKs that share common core functionality while offering platform-specific implementations:

1. **Mobile Platform SDKs**:
   - Android (Java/Kotlin)
   - iOS (Swift)
   - React Native
   - Flutter

2. **Web Platform SDKs**:
   - Browser (JavaScript)

3. **Server-Side SDKs**:
   - Node.js
   - Python
   - JRE Java
   - Go

4. **Game Development SDKs**:
   - Unity
   - Unreal Engine

All SDKs provide consistent core capabilities with platform-specific implementations:
- Event tracking for user interactions
- User and device identification
- Session management
- Batch processing of events
- Offline support with local storage
- COPPA compliance controls
- Server zone configuration for data residency
- Customizable storage providers

The Android SDK specifically offers detailed configuration for batching behavior, device ID management, session tracking, storage customization, and network settings.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: A tracked user action or occurrence within an application
- **User ID**: Unique identifier for tracking individual users across sessions
- **Device ID**: Unique identifier for a specific device
- **Session**: A defined period of user engagement with the application
- **Batch API**: Method for sending multiple events in a single network request
- **flushIntervalMillis**: Time interval configuration for automatically sending batched events
- **flushQueueSize**: Maximum number of events to batch before sending
- **StorageProvider**: Interface for customizing local event data storage
- **serverZone**: Configuration parameter for specifying data residency (EU or US)
- **COPPA**: Children's Online Privacy Protection Act - controls for regulatory compliance

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The SDK Catalog functions as the data collection layer within Amplitude's broader analytics platform. The SDKs collect and transmit user event data to Amplitude's analytics backend, where it can be analyzed through Amplitude's dashboard and reporting tools.

Key integration points include:
- Connection to Amplitude's identity management system for cross-platform user tracking
- Support for data residency options through server zone configuration
- Compliance capabilities for regional data privacy regulations
- Integration with Amplitude's analytics backend for data processing and visualization

Each SDK has dedicated documentation following a consistent template structure, with the exception of Unity and Unreal Engine SDKs which redirect to specific documentation paths. The catalog organization allows developers to easily locate the appropriate SDK for their development environment.
