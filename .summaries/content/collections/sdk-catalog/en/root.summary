# Amplitude SDK Catalog

## Product Overview

Amplitude provides a comprehensive suite of Software Development Kits (SDKs) for tracking user events and analytics across multiple platforms and programming languages. These SDKs enable developers to integrate Amplitude's analytics capabilities into their applications, allowing for the collection and analysis of user behavior data. The SDKs support event tracking, user identification, session management, and various configuration options to customize data collection according to specific requirements.

## Key Features and Concepts

- **Event Tracking**: All SDKs support tracking user interactions and custom events within applications
- **User Identification**: Capabilities for identifying and tracking individual users across sessions
- **Session Management**: Tools for defining and tracking user sessions
- **Batch Processing**: Configuration options for batching events before sending to Amplitude servers
- **Offline Support**: Ability to store events locally when offline and send them when connectivity is restored
- **Storage Providers**: Customizable storage solutions for event data
- **Server Zone Configuration**: Options to specify data residency requirements
- **COPPA Compliance**: Controls for applications that may be used by children

## Platform Support

Amplitude provides SDKs for a wide range of platforms and programming languages:

1. **Mobile Platforms**:
   - Android (Java/Kotlin)
   - iOS (Swift)
   - React Native
   - Flutter

2. **Web Platforms**:
   - Browser (JavaScript)

3. **Server-Side Languages**:
   - Node.js (JavaScript/TypeScript)
   - Python
   - JRE Java
   - Go

4. **Game Development**:
   - Unity
   - Unreal Engine

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **flushIntervalMillis**: The time interval between event batch uploads
- **flushQueueSize**: The number of events to collect before triggering an upload
- **deviceId**: A unique identifier for the device using the application
- **userId**: A unique identifier for the user of the application
- **sessionId**: A unique identifier for a user session
- **StorageProvider**: Interface for customizing how events are stored locally
- **ServerZone**: Configuration option for specifying data residency (US, EU, etc.)
- **COPPA**: Children's Online Privacy Protection Act compliance settings
- **Batch API**: Mechanism for sending multiple events in a single network request
- **Offline mode**: Functionality that allows the SDK to store events when no network connection is available

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude SDK catalog is part of Amplitude's broader analytics platform. The SDKs serve as the data collection layer, capturing user events and sending them to Amplitude's backend services for processing and analysis. The collected data can then be visualized and analyzed through Amplitude's dashboard and reporting tools.

The SDKs integrate with Amplitude's:
- Analytics platform for data visualization
- User identification and cohort analysis features
- A/B testing capabilities
- Data management and governance tools

## Implementation Details

While detailed API endpoints aren't provided in the summaries, the Android SDK documentation reveals implementation patterns likely common across SDKs:

```kotlin
// Kotlin example for Android SDK configuration
val config = Configuration(
    apiKey = "YOUR-API-KEY",
    flushIntervalMillis = 10000,
    flushQueueSize = 30,
    logLevel = LogLevel.DEBUG
)
Amplitude.init(applicationContext, config)
```

```java
// Java example for Android SDK configuration
Configuration configuration = new Configuration(
    "YOUR-API-KEY",
    getApplicationContext()
);
configuration.setFlushIntervalMillis(10000);
configuration.setFlushQueueSize(30);
configuration.setLogLevel(LogLevel.DEBUG);
Amplitude.init(configuration);
```

The SDKs follow a similar pattern of initialization with configuration options, followed by event tracking and user identification methods.
