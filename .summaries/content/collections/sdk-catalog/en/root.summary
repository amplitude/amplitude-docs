## Amplitude SDK Catalog

The Amplitude SDK Catalog is a comprehensive collection of Software Development Kits (SDKs) that enable developers to integrate Amplitude's analytics platform across multiple programming languages, frameworks, and platforms. This catalog serves as a centralized directory for accessing Amplitude's data collection and analytics capabilities across diverse development environments.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The SDK catalog represents a unified analytics ecosystem where each SDK provides platform-specific implementations of Amplitude's core analytics functionality. All SDKs share common objectives:

- **Event Tracking**: Capture user interactions and custom events
- **User Identification**: Manage user identity and session tracking
- **Data Transmission**: Send analytics data to Amplitude servers
- **Configuration Management**: Handle SDK-specific settings and behaviors

The SDKs are organized into distinct categories:

**Mobile Platforms:**
- **Android SDK** (Kotlin): Native Android implementation with comprehensive configuration options
- **iOS SDK**: Native iOS/Swift implementation
- **Flutter SDK**: Cross-platform mobile development framework
- **React Native SDK**: JavaScript-based cross-platform mobile solution
- **Unity SDK**: Game development platform integration
- **Unreal Engine SDK**: Advanced game development platform support

**Web and Server Platforms:**
- **Browser SDK**: Client-side JavaScript implementation for web applications
- **Node.js SDK**: Server-side JavaScript/TypeScript implementation
- **Python SDK**: Server-side Python implementation
- **Go SDK**: Server-side Go implementation
- **JRE Java SDK**: Java Runtime Environment implementation

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Configuration Concepts:**
- **flushIntervalMillis**: Time interval for automatic event transmission batching
- **flushQueueSize**: Maximum number of events queued before forced transmission
- **deviceId**: Unique device identifier for user tracking
- **serverZone**: Geographic server location (US/EU) for data residency compliance
- **sessionTracking**: Automatic user session management and event generation
- **batchAPI**: Optimized bulk event transmission mode

**Privacy and Compliance:**
- **COPPA**: Children's Online Privacy Protection Act compliance controls
- **useAdvertisingIdForDeviceId**: Mobile advertising identifier usage
- **useAppSetIdForDeviceId**: Android App Set ID implementation
- **migrateLegacyData**: Data migration from previous SDK versions

**Event Management:**
- **trackingSessionEvents**: Automatic session start/end event generation
- **defaultTracking**: Pre-configured event tracking behaviors
- **identifyBatchIntervalMillis**: User identification event batching interval
- **minTimeBetweenSessionsMillis**: Session timeout configuration

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The SDK catalog integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics and experimentation platform through several key mechanisms:

**Data Pipeline Integration:**
- All SDKs transmit data to centralized Amplitude servers via standardized APIs
- Support for both US and EU server zones ensures global data residency compliance
- Batch API mode optimizes data transmission for high-volume applications

**Developer Experience:**
- Consistent documentation structure across all SDKs via external source links
- Standardized template system (`sdk-landing`) for uniform presentation
- Centralized catalog management through content management system

**Platform Ecosystem:**
- Mobile SDKs integrate with platform-specific features (advertising IDs, app store compliance)
- Server-side SDKs support backend analytics and data processing workflows
- Game development SDKs (Unity, Unreal) provide specialized gaming analytics capabilities
- Web SDKs enable comprehensive user journey tracking across digital properties

**Documentation Architecture:**
The catalog uses a structured content management approach with:
- Unique identifiers for each SDK entry
- External source documentation links pointing to `docs.developers.amplitude.com`
- Consistent metadata including logos, authors, and update timestamps
- Template-based rendering system for standardized presentation

This SDK catalog serves as the primary entry point for developers seeking to implement Amplitude analytics across their technology stack, providing both breadth of platform coverage and depth of configuration options to meet diverse analytical requirements.
