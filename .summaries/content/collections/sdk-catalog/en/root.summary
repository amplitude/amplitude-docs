# Amplitude SDK Catalog

## Product Overview

Amplitude provides a comprehensive suite of Software Development Kits (SDKs) that enable developers to integrate analytics and event tracking capabilities into applications across multiple platforms. These SDKs facilitate the collection of user behavior data, which can be analyzed to gain insights into user engagement, retention, and conversion.

The Amplitude SDK ecosystem supports a wide range of platforms and programming languages, allowing developers to implement consistent analytics tracking regardless of their technology stack. Key features include event tracking, user identification, session management, batch processing of events, and offline data collection.

## Product Relationships and Features

The Amplitude SDK catalog consists of SDKs for various platforms:

1. **Mobile Platforms**:
   - **Android SDK**: Provides event tracking for Android applications with Kotlin and Java support
   - **iOS SDK**: Enables analytics integration for iOS applications using Swift
   - **React Native SDK**: Cross-platform solution for React Native mobile applications
   - **Flutter SDK**: Cross-platform solution for Flutter mobile applications

2. **Web Platforms**:
   - **Browser SDK**: JavaScript-based SDK for web applications

3. **Backend/Server Platforms**:
   - **Node.js SDK**: For server-side JavaScript applications
   - **Python SDK**: For Python-based backend services
   - **Go SDK**: For Go-based backend services
   - **JRE Java SDK**: For Java-based backend services

4. **Game Development Platforms**:
   - **Unity SDK**: For games and applications built with Unity
   - **Unreal Engine SDK**: For games and applications built with Unreal Engine

All SDKs share common functionality while providing platform-specific implementations. The Android SDK, for example, offers detailed configuration options for event batching, device ID management, session tracking, and network settings.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

Based on the Android SDK documentation, the following key terms and concepts are used across Amplitude SDKs:

- **Event Tracking**: The core functionality to record user actions and behaviors
- **Configuration Options**: Settings that control SDK behavior
- **Batch Processing**: Grouping multiple events together before sending to reduce network calls
  - **flushIntervalMillis**: Time interval between event batch uploads
  - **flushQueueSize**: Number of events that trigger automatic upload
- **Device ID Management**: Methods for identifying unique devices
- **Session Tracking**: Monitoring user engagement periods
- **Offline Mode**: Capability to store events locally when network connectivity is unavailable
- **StorageProvider**: Interface for customizing how events are stored locally
- **ServerZone**: Geographic region configuration for data storage compliance

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude SDK catalog is part of Amplitude's broader analytics platform. The SDKs serve as data collection tools that feed into Amplitude's analytics dashboard and data processing pipeline. The documentation structure suggests that these SDKs follow a consistent pattern:

1. Each SDK has a dedicated landing page with platform-specific documentation
2. SDKs are categorized by platform type (mobile, web, backend, game development)
3. All SDKs connect to the same Amplitude backend services for data processing

The Unity and Unreal Engine SDK pages include redirects to more specific documentation paths ("/docs/sdks/analytics/unity/unity-sdk" and "/docs/sdks/analytics/unreal/unreal-sdk" respectively), suggesting a hierarchical organization of documentation where these game development SDKs may be part of a specialized analytics offering.

## API and Implementation Details

While the provided file summaries don't contain extensive API details, the Android SDK documentation mentions several important configuration options and methods:

- Configuration parameters like `flushIntervalMillis` and `flushQueueSize` for controlling batch behavior
- Device ID management functionality
- Session tracking configuration
- Network settings including offline mode

Each SDK appears to have its own implementation details while maintaining consistent core functionality across platforms, allowing developers to implement Amplitude analytics in a platform-appropriate way while ensuring data consistency.
