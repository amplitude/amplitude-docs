# Amplitude SDK Catalog

## Product Overview

Amplitude provides a comprehensive suite of Software Development Kits (SDKs) for tracking user events and analytics across multiple platforms and programming languages. These SDKs enable developers to integrate Amplitude's analytics capabilities into their applications, allowing for the collection and analysis of user behavior data. The SDKs support event tracking, user identification, session management, and various configuration options to customize data collection according to specific requirements.

## Key Features and Concepts

- **Event Tracking**: All SDKs support tracking user interactions and custom events within applications
- **User Identification**: Capabilities for identifying and tracking individual users across sessions
- **Session Management**: Tools for defining and tracking user sessions
- **Batch Processing**: Configuration options for batching events before sending to reduce network overhead
- **Offline Support**: Ability to store events locally when offline and send them when connectivity is restored
- **COPPA Compliance**: Controls for Children's Online Privacy Protection Act compliance
- **Server Zone Configuration**: Options to specify data residency requirements
- **Storage Providers**: Customizable storage solutions for event data

## Platform Support

Amplitude offers SDKs for a wide range of platforms and programming languages:

1. **Mobile Platforms**:
   - Android (Java/Kotlin)
   - iOS (Swift)
   - React Native
   - Flutter

2. **Web Platforms**:
   - Browser (JavaScript)

3. **Server-Side**:
   - Node.js
   - Python
   - JRE Java
   - Go

4. **Game Development**:
   - Unity
   - Unreal Engine

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: A user action or occurrence that is tracked in the application
- **User ID**: A unique identifier for a user across sessions
- **Device ID**: A unique identifier for a specific device
- **Session**: A period of user engagement with the application
- **Batch API**: Method for sending multiple events in a single network request
- **flushIntervalMillis**: Time interval for automatically sending batched events
- **flushQueueSize**: Maximum number of events to batch before sending
- **StorageProvider**: Interface for customizing how event data is stored locally
- **serverZone**: Configuration for specifying data residency (EU or US)
- **COPPA**: Children's Online Privacy Protection Act - controls for compliance with this regulation

## Android SDK Specifics

The Android SDK provides detailed configuration options for:

- **Batching Behavior**: Control over when events are sent to Amplitude servers using `flushIntervalMillis` and `flushQueueSize`
- **Device ID Management**: Options for handling device identification across app installations
- **Session Tracking**: Configuration for defining session timeouts and tracking
- **Storage Providers**: Customizable storage solutions for event data
- **Network Settings**: Options for handling offline mode and connectivity issues

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude SDK catalog is part of Amplitude's broader analytics platform. The SDKs serve as the data collection layer, sending user event data to Amplitude's analytics backend. This data can then be analyzed through Amplitude's dashboard and reporting tools to gain insights into user behavior, conversion funnels, retention, and other key metrics.

The SDKs integrate with Amplitude's identity management system, allowing for consistent user tracking across different platforms and sessions. They also support Amplitude's data residency options through server zone configuration, enabling compliance with regional data privacy regulations.

## Documentation Structure

Each SDK has its own dedicated documentation page accessible through the source URLs provided in the metadata. The documentation follows a consistent template (`sdk-landing`) for most SDKs, with Unity and Unreal Engine redirecting to specific documentation paths.

The documentation is organized in a catalog structure, making it easy for developers to find the appropriate SDK for their platform or programming language.
