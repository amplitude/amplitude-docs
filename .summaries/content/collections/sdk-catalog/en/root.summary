## Amplitude SDK Catalog

The Amplitude SDK Catalog is a comprehensive collection of Software Development Kits (SDKs) that enable developers to integrate Amplitude's analytics platform across multiple programming languages and development environments. This catalog serves as a centralized directory for accessing platform-specific SDKs that facilitate event tracking, user analytics, and behavioral data collection.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The SDK catalog represents a multi-platform approach to analytics integration, with each SDK serving as a bridge between applications and Amplitude's analytics infrastructure. The SDKs are organized by platform and programming language, covering:

**Mobile Platforms:**
- Android (Kotlin-based SDK)
- iOS (Swift-based SDK) 
- Flutter (cross-platform mobile)
- React Native (cross-platform mobile)
- Unity (game development)
- Unreal Engine (game development)

**Web and Server Platforms:**
- Browser (JavaScript)
- Node.js (server-side JavaScript/TypeScript)
- Python (server-side)
- JRE Java (server-side)
- Go (server-side)

Each SDK maintains consistent core functionality while providing platform-specific optimizations and features. The catalog uses a standardized documentation structure with each SDK entry containing metadata including unique identifiers, source documentation links, platform-specific logos, and template specifications.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Configuration Parameters:**
- `flushIntervalMillis`: Time interval for automatic event batching and transmission
- `flushQueueSize`: Maximum number of events to queue before forcing transmission
- `deviceId`: Unique device identifier for user tracking
- `instanceName`: Allows SDK isolation for multiple Amplitude projects
- `ServerZone`: Geographic server routing (US/EU) for data residency compliance

**Device Identification:**
- `useAdvertisingIdForDeviceId`: Leverages advertising identifiers for device tracking
- `useAppSetIdForDeviceId`: Uses Android App Set ID for device identification
- `AndroidStorageProvider`/`FileIdentityStorageProvider`: Storage mechanisms for persistent user data

**Session Management:**
- `trackingSessionEvents`: Controls automatic session event generation
- `minTimeBetweenSessionsMillis`: Defines session timeout parameters
- `defaultTracking`: Enables automatic event collection

**Compliance and Privacy:**
- `COPPA`: Children's Online Privacy Protection Act compliance controls
- `migrateLegacyData`: Handles data migration from previous SDK versions

**Network and Performance:**
- `useBatch API`: Enables batch event upload for improved performance
- `AndroidNetworkConnectivityCheckerPlugin`: Network-aware event transmission

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The SDK catalog operates within Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem, serving as the primary data ingestion layer. Each SDK connects to Amplitude's event collection infrastructure through standardized APIs, enabling:

1. **Unified Data Collection**: All SDKs feed into the same analytics pipeline, ensuring consistent data structure across platforms
2. **Cross-Platform User Journey Tracking**: Device and user identification systems enable tracking across multiple platforms
3. **Geographic Data Routing**: Server zone configuration supports global deployments with regional data residency requirements
4. **Legacy System Migration**: Built-in migration tools facilitate upgrades from older SDK versions

## Technical Implementation Details

The catalog structure uses a content management system with YAML frontmatter containing:
- Unique identifiers for each SDK
- Source documentation URLs pointing to detailed implementation guides
- Template specifications (`sdk-landing`) for consistent presentation
- Author attribution and update timestamps
- Platform-specific iconography

**API Integration:**
- Batch event upload APIs for efficient data transmission
- Network connectivity checking for offline/online event handling
- Configurable flush mechanisms for balancing performance and data freshness

The documentation architecture supports both direct implementation guidance and redirect mechanisms for consolidated documentation (as seen with Unity and Unreal Engine SDKs), indicating a strategic approach to documentation maintenance and user experience optimization.
