## Amplitude SDK Catalog

The Amplitude SDK Catalog is a comprehensive collection of Software Development Kits (SDKs) that enable developers to integrate Amplitude's analytics platform across multiple programming languages, frameworks, and platforms. This catalog serves as a centralized directory for accessing Amplitude's data collection and analytics capabilities across diverse development environments.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The SDK catalog represents a unified analytics ecosystem where each SDK provides platform-specific implementations of Amplitude's core analytics functionality. The SDKs are organized into several categories:

**Mobile Development:**
- **Android SDK (Kotlin)** - Native Android implementation with comprehensive device tracking and session management
- **iOS SDK** - Native iOS implementation for Apple ecosystem integration
- **Flutter SDK** - Cross-platform mobile development framework support
- **React Native SDK** - JavaScript-based cross-platform mobile development
- **Unity SDK** - Game development engine integration for mobile and desktop games
- **Unreal Engine SDK** - Advanced game development engine support

**Web Development:**
- **Browser SDK** - Client-side JavaScript implementation for web applications
- **Node.js SDK** - Server-side JavaScript/TypeScript implementation

**Backend and Server-Side:**
- **Python SDK** - Server-side analytics for Python applications
- **JRE Java SDK** - Enterprise Java application integration
- **Go SDK** - High-performance server-side implementation

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Configuration Concepts:**
- **flushIntervalMillis** - Time interval for automatic event transmission to Amplitude servers
- **flushQueueSize** - Maximum number of events stored locally before triggering transmission
- **deviceId lifecycle** - Management of unique device identifiers across app sessions
- **serverZone configuration** - Geographic server selection for data residency compliance
- **batch API** - Efficient bulk event transmission mechanism

**Privacy and Compliance:**
- **COPPA control** - Children's Online Privacy Protection Act compliance features
- **trackingOptions** - Granular control over data collection parameters
- **advertising ID** - Mobile advertising identifier management
- **app set ID** - Android app set identifier for privacy-focused attribution

**Data Management:**
- **session tracking** - User session boundary detection and management
- **offline mode** - Local event storage when network connectivity is unavailable
- **migrateLegacyData** - Data migration utilities for SDK upgrades
- **storage providers** - Pluggable storage backends (e.g., AndroidStorageProvider)

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The SDK catalog integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics and experimentation platform through standardized APIs and data formats. Each SDK implements consistent event tracking, user identification, and property management while adapting to platform-specific requirements and capabilities.

**Data Flow Architecture:**
Events collected by SDKs are transmitted to Amplitude's servers via batch APIs, enabling real-time analytics, user segmentation, and behavioral analysis across the entire product ecosystem.

**Cross-Platform Consistency:**
All SDKs maintain consistent event schemas and user identification mechanisms, allowing organizations to track user journeys across multiple platforms and touchpoints seamlessly.

## Technical Implementation Details

**Source Documentation:**
Each SDK references comprehensive documentation at `docs.developers.amplitude.com/data/sdks/[platform]/`, providing detailed implementation guides, API references, and best practices.

**Template Structure:**
SDKs utilize the `sdk-landing` template for consistent presentation and navigation, with platform-specific icons and branding elements.

**Redirect Mechanisms:**
Some SDKs (Unity, Unreal) implement redirect patterns to consolidated documentation locations, indicating potential documentation restructuring or legacy support considerations.

The catalog represents a mature, multi-platform analytics solution designed to provide consistent data collection capabilities across the entire modern development stack, from mobile applications to enterprise server infrastructure.
