# Amplitude SDK Catalog

## Product Overview

Amplitude provides a comprehensive suite of Software Development Kits (SDKs) for tracking user events and analytics across multiple platforms and programming languages. These SDKs enable developers to integrate Amplitude's analytics capabilities into their applications, allowing for detailed tracking of user behavior, session management, and event logging.

The SDKs support various configuration options including event batching, device ID management, session tracking, storage providers, and network settings. They are designed to work across different environments including mobile applications, web browsers, game engines, and server-side applications.

## Product Relationships and Features

The Amplitude SDK catalog consists of SDKs for multiple platforms:

1. **Mobile Platforms**:
   - Android SDK - For native Android applications
   - iOS SDK - For native iOS/Swift applications
   - React Native SDK - For cross-platform mobile applications using React Native
   - Flutter SDK - For cross-platform mobile applications using Flutter

2. **Web Platforms**:
   - Browser SDK - For web applications and websites

3. **Game Development**:
   - Unity SDK - For applications built with Unity game engine
   - Unreal Engine SDK - For applications built with Unreal Engine

4. **Server-Side/Backend**:
   - Node.js SDK - For JavaScript/TypeScript server applications
   - Python SDK - For Python applications
   - JRE Java SDK - For Java applications
   - Go SDK - For Go applications

Each SDK shares core functionality while providing platform-specific implementations. The Android SDK, which has the most detailed documentation in the provided files, offers extensive configuration options for event tracking, including batching behavior, device ID management, session tracking, and storage providers.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

Based on the Android SDK documentation, key terms and concepts include:

- **Event Tracking**: The core functionality to log user actions and behaviors
- **flushIntervalMillis**: Time interval for batching and sending events to Amplitude servers
- **flushQueueSize**: Number of events to batch before sending to Amplitude servers
- **deviceId**: Unique identifier for the device or user
- **Batch API**: Mechanism for sending multiple events in a single network request
- **Offline Mode**: Capability to store events locally when network connectivity is unavailable
- **StorageProvider**: Interface for customizing how events are stored locally
- **Session Tracking**: Mechanism for grouping events into user sessions
- **COPPA Control**: Children's Online Privacy Protection Act compliance settings
- **ServerZone**: Configuration for data residency (US or EU servers)
- **Legacy Data Migration**: Process for migrating data from older SDK versions

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude SDKs are part of Amplitude's broader analytics platform. They serve as the data collection layer that feeds into Amplitude's analytics dashboard and reporting tools. The SDKs are designed to:

1. Collect user event data from various platforms
2. Process and batch this data efficiently
3. Send the data to Amplitude's servers for analysis
4. Support offline functionality when connectivity is limited
5. Provide configuration options to comply with privacy regulations

The SDKs integrate with the rest of the Amplitude ecosystem by sending data to Amplitude's servers, which can then be analyzed using Amplitude's analytics tools. The documentation suggests that the SDKs support various Amplitude features such as user identification, event properties, and session tracking.

## API Endpoints and Usage

While specific API endpoints aren't detailed in most of the provided files, the Android SDK documentation mentions configuration options that suggest interaction with Amplitude's servers:

- Server zone configuration (US or EU)
- Batch API for sending multiple events
- Flush mechanisms for controlling when events are sent to servers

The Android SDK provides code examples in both Kotlin and Java for configuration and usage, including:

```kotlin
// Kotlin example for configuring the SDK
val config = Configuration(
    apiKey = AMPLITUDE_API_KEY,
    flushIntervalMillis = 1000,
    flushQueueSize = 10
)
Amplitude.init(context, config)
```

```java
// Java example for configuring the SDK
Configuration configuration = new Configuration(
    AMPLITUDE_API_KEY,
    getApplicationContext()
);
configuration.setFlushIntervalMillis(1000);
configuration.setFlushQueueSize(10);
Amplitude.init(configuration);
```

The Unity and Unreal Engine SDKs appear to redirect to more specific documentation pages, suggesting they may have specialized implementations for game development environments.
