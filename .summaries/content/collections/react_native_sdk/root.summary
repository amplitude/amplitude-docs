The React Native SDK for Amplitude is a comprehensive analytics tracking solution designed for React Native applications, offering strongly-typed event tracking capabilities through both current and maintenance SDK versions. The platform provides robust analytics infrastructure with advanced user management, data enrichment, and flexible configuration options.

## Product Architecture and Core Components

The SDK operates through three foundational pillars: event tracking, user management, and data enrichment. Event tracking utilizes the `track()` method for custom event logging with properties, while user management leverages the Identify class for property operations including `setOnce`, `add`, `prepend`, and `append`. The architecture employs a sophisticated plugin system supporting EnrichmentPlugin and DestinationPlugin types, enabling data transformation and custom destination routing through Amplitude's HTTP V2 API.

The platform features a configurable Transport interface for custom HTTP client implementations and includes advanced capabilities such as revenue tracking via the Revenue interface, group analytics through `setGroup()` and `groupIdentify()` methods, and comprehensive session management with configurable tracking parameters.

## SDK Versions and Migration Framework

The product maintains two distinct SDK versions: the current `@amplitude/analytics-react-native` and the maintenance `@amplitude/react-native` version. The migration framework includes automated tooling and API method transitions, where legacy methods like `getInstance()/init()` become `init()`, `logEvent()` transforms to `track()`, and `uploadEvents()` becomes `flush()`. Starting with v1.3.4, automatic data migration is available through the `migrateLegacyData` configuration option, facilitating seamless transitions from HTTP V1 to HTTP V2 API endpoints.

## Ampli Integration and Code Generation

The Ampli Wrapper generates strongly-typed APIs based on Amplitude Data tracking plans, supporting JavaScript ES6 and TypeScript 2.1+ with CJS module packaging. Core Ampli methods include `ampli.load()` for initialization, `ampli.identify()` for user identification, `ampli.track()` for schema-validated event tracking, and `ampli.flush()` for immediate data transmission. The Ampli CLI provides essential commands including `ampli pull` for downloading tracking plans and `ampli status` for validation checking.

## Key Nomenclature and Configuration Framework

**Configuration Parameters**: The SDK employs `flushQueueSize` and `flushIntervalMillis` for batching behavior control, `serverZone` for EU data residency compliance, `trackingOptions` for optional data collection configuration, and `migrateLegacyData` for automatic legacy SDK data migration.

**User Identity Management**: User management utilizes `setUserId()`, `setDeviceId()`, and `setSessionId()` for identity control, while the `reset()` method handles user logout scenarios and `setOptOut()` provides tracking disable functionality.

**Advertising Identifiers**: The platform supports comprehensive advertising identifier tracking including ADID (Android Advertising ID), AppSetId, IDFV (iOS Identifier for Vendors), and IDFA (iOS Identifier for Advertisers), with specific dependency requirements such as `play-services-appset`.

## Installation and Platform Integration

Installation requires the core package plus `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` for data persistence. Platform-specific setup includes `pod install` for iOS environments and Gradle configuration for Android platforms. The SDK maintains detailed compatibility matrices for React Native versions and Android Gradle Plugin versions, ensuring broad platform support.

## Advanced Analytics Features

The platform provides COPPA control through `enableCoppaControl()`, EU data residency via server zone configuration, and OTA (over-the-air) update considerations. Location tracking and advertising identifier collection are configurable through tracking options, while the plugin system enables custom data enrichment and destination routing.

Revenue tracking utilizes dedicated Revenue objects with properties for price, quantity, and product identification. Group analytics enable tracking of user groups and group-level properties through specialized identify operations, supporting complex organizational analytics scenarios.

## Broader Ecosystem Integration

The React Native SDK integrates seamlessly with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem, communicating with Amplitude's HTTP V2 API infrastructure and supporting the company's data governance framework through tracking plans and schema validation. The SDK's plugin architecture and Transport interface enable integration with custom analytics pipelines and third-party data destinations, positioning it as a flexible component within larger data analytics architectures.
