The React Native SDK for Amplitude is a comprehensive analytics tracking solution that enables React Native applications to collect, manage, and send user behavior data to Amplitude's analytics platform. The SDK provides strongly-typed event tracking capabilities with support for both JavaScript and TypeScript applications, offering flexible configuration options for different deployment scenarios including standard React Native apps and Expo-managed workflows.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The React Native SDK ecosystem consists of three main components that serve different lifecycle stages and use cases:

**Current SDK (`@amplitude/analytics-react-native`)**: The actively maintained, feature-complete SDK that serves as the primary analytics solution. It requires `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` as a core dependency for local data persistence and supports both iOS and Android platforms through native bridging.

**Maintenance SDK (`@amplitude/react-native`)**: The legacy SDK in maintenance mode that continues to receive critical updates but no new feature development. This SDK uses the older `getInstance()` pattern and different API nomenclature.

**Ampli Wrapper**: A code generation tool that creates strongly-typed APIs based on Amplitude Data tracking plans, building on top of the current React Native SDK to provide compile-time validation and enhanced developer experience for teams using structured event schemas.

The migration path flows from the maintenance SDK to the current SDK, with automatic data migration capabilities starting in version 1.3.4 to ensure continuity of user sessions and device identification.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core SDK Methods:**
- `init()`: Initializes the SDK with API key and configuration options
- `track()`: Records events with optional properties and user context
- `identify()`: Updates user properties using the Identify class operations
- `flush()`: Forces immediate upload of queued events to Amplitude servers
- `setUserId()`: Associates events with a specific user identifier
- `setDeviceId()`: Sets device-specific identifier for anonymous tracking
- `setGroup()`: Associates users with group entities for B2B analytics

**Configuration Parameters:**
- `flushQueueSize`: Number of events to batch before automatic upload
- `flushIntervalMillis`: Time interval for automatic event uploads
- `serverZone`: Data residency control (US/EU server selection)
- `useBatch`: Enables HTTP V2 API batch endpoint for improved performance
- `trackingOptions`: Controls automatic data collection (IP, device info, etc.)
- `migrateLegacyData`: Enables automatic migration from maintenance SDK

**Data Management Classes:**
- `Identify`: Provides operations for user property management (set, add, remove, unset)
- `Revenue`: Handles e-commerce tracking with product details and revenue amounts
- `EnrichmentPlugin`: Modifies events before sending to add context or validation
- `DestinationPlugin`: Custom event routing and processing destinations

**Mobile-Specific Identifiers:**
- `ADID`: Android Advertising ID for attribution tracking
- `IDFV`: iOS Identifier for Vendor for app-specific identification
- `IDFA`: iOS Identifier for Advertisers for cross-app attribution
- `AppSetId`: Android App Set ID for privacy-compliant attribution

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The React Native SDK integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem through several key touchpoints:

**Amplitude Data Integration**: The Ampli wrapper connects directly to Amplitude Data's tracking plan management system, enabling teams to define event schemas centrally and generate type-safe tracking code using commands like `ampli pull` and `ampli status`.

**Cross-Platform Consistency**: The SDK maintains API compatibility with other Amplitude SDKs while adapting to React Native's specific requirements, including async storage dependencies and platform-specific native module integration.

**Backend Infrastructure**: Events flow through Amplitude's HTTP V2 API endpoints, with configurable data residency options supporting both US and EU server zones for compliance requirements.

**Plugin Architecture**: The SDK supports extensibility through EnrichmentPlugin and DestinationPlugin interfaces, allowing integration with third-party tools, custom analytics pipelines, and data transformation workflows.

## Technical Implementation Details

**Installation and Setup:**
```bash
npm install @amplitude/analytics-react-native @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
# or
yarn add @amplitude/analytics-react-native @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
# iOS additional step
cd ios && pod install
```

**Core API Usage:**
- Event tracking: `track('Event Name', { property: 'value' })`
- User identification: `identify(new Identify().set('property', 'value'))`
- Revenue tracking: `revenue(new Revenue().setPrice(10.99).setProductId('product_123'))`
- Group analytics: `groupIdentify('company', 'amplitude', new Identify().set('plan', 'enterprise'))`

**Advanced Configuration:**
The SDK supports comprehensive configuration including COPPA compliance controls, custom HTTP transport providers, session timeout management, and advertising identifier tracking with appropriate privacy controls. Platform-specific features include Android Gradle compatibility matrices and iOS bridging header requirements for native module integration.

The SDK maintains backward compatibility while providing migration utilities and supports both over-the-air (OTA) updates through Expo and traditional React Native deployment workflows.
