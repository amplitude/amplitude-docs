## React Native SDK for Amplitude Analytics

The React Native SDK for Amplitude is a comprehensive analytics tracking solution that provides strongly typed event tracking capabilities for React Native applications. The SDK supports both JavaScript ES6 and TypeScript 2.1+ environments and integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem through multiple implementation approaches.

## Core Products and Features

The directory encompasses three primary SDK implementations:

**Latest React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/analytics-react-native`) - The current production SDK featuring HTTP V2 API support, plugin architecture, and modern React Native compatibility. This SDK requires `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` as a native module dependency and supports comprehensive event tracking, user identification, revenue tracking, and group analytics.

**Maintenance React Native SDK** (`@amplitude/react-native`) - The legacy SDK in maintenance mode that continues to support existing implementations while providing migration pathways to the latest version. This SDK uses HTTP V1 API and traditional configuration patterns.

**Ampli Wrapper** - A code generation tool that creates strongly typed APIs based on Amplitude Data tracking plans, providing autocompletion, event schema validation, and compile-time type checking for both JavaScript and TypeScript implementations.

## Product Relationships and Integration

The three components work together in a hierarchical ecosystem where the Ampli Wrapper sits atop either SDK implementation to provide enhanced developer experience. The migration documentation establishes clear upgrade paths from the maintenance SDK to the latest SDK, with automatic data migration capabilities starting in v1.3.4.

The latest SDK introduces a plugin architecture supporting EnrichmentPlugin and destination plugins, while maintaining backward compatibility through configuration options like `migrateLegacyData`. Both SDKs integrate with platform-specific features including advertising identifiers (ADID, IDFV, IDFA, AppSetId) and carrier tracking, though iOS 16+ introduces limitations due to deprecated CTCarrier APIs.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core API Methods:**
- `init()` / `getInstance()` - SDK initialization with API key configuration
- `track()` / `logEvent()` - Event tracking with properties and user context
- `identify()` / `setUserProperties()` - User property management and identification
- `flush()` / `uploadEvents()` - Manual event transmission to Amplitude servers
- `revenue()` / `logRevenue()` - Revenue event tracking with product details

**Configuration Concepts:**
- **serverZone** - Data residency control (US/EU) for compliance requirements
- **trackingOptions** - Platform-specific data collection controls (carrier, ADID, location)
- **useBatch** - HTTP V2 batch API utilization for improved performance
- **migrateLegacyData** - Automatic data migration from maintenance to latest SDK

**Ampli-Specific Terms:**
- **Tracking Plan** - Amplitude Data schema definitions for event structure
- **Event Schemas** - Strongly typed event definitions with property validation
- **ampli pull** - CLI command for downloading latest tracking plan definitions
- **ampli status** - CLI command for validating local implementation against tracking plan

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The React Native SDK integrates with Amplitude's comprehensive analytics platform through multiple touchpoints. The HTTP V2 API provides enhanced performance and feature support, while the plugin architecture enables custom enrichment and destination routing. The SDK supports Amplitude Data integration through the Ampli Wrapper, enabling governance and type safety across development teams.

Platform-specific integrations include Google Play Services dependencies (`play-services-appset`, `play-services-ads-identifier`) for Android advertising ID collection and iOS App Tracking Transparency framework support for IDFA collection. The SDK accommodates various deployment scenarios including Expo applications and over-the-air (OTA) update environments.

## API Endpoints and CLI Commands

**Ampli CLI Commands:**
- `ampli pull` - Downloads tracking plan definitions and generates typed APIs
- `ampli status` - Validates implementation coverage against tracking plan requirements

**Key Configuration Methods:**
- `ampli.load()` - Initializes Ampli wrapper with environment and client configuration
- `ampli.identify()` - User identification with strongly typed user properties
- `ampli.track()` - Type-safe event tracking with schema validation
- `ampli.flush()` - Manual event transmission

The SDK supports custom HTTP client implementation through `transportProvider` configuration and provides comprehensive session tracking with `trackingSessionEvents` controls. COPPA compliance is supported through dedicated configuration options, while EU data residency requirements are addressed via `serverZone` configuration.
