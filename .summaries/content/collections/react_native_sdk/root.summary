The React Native SDK for Amplitude is a comprehensive analytics tracking solution that enables mobile app developers to implement event tracking, user analytics, and behavioral insights in React Native applications. The SDK provides strongly-typed APIs, automatic data collection, and seamless integration with Amplitude's analytics platform.

## Product Architecture and Features

The React Native SDK ecosystem consists of three main components:

**Current SDK (`@amplitude/analytics-react-native`)**: The actively maintained, feature-rich SDK built on a modern plugin architecture with HTTP V2 API support, enhanced performance, and comprehensive tracking capabilities.

**Maintenance SDK (`@amplitude/react-native`)**: The legacy SDK in maintenance mode that continues to receive critical updates but no new feature development.

**Ampli Wrapper**: A code generation tool that creates strongly-typed APIs based on Amplitude Data tracking plans, providing compile-time validation and autocompletion for events and properties.

## Key Relationships and Integration Points

The products work together in a layered approach where the Ampli Wrapper sits on top of the core React Native SDK, generating type-safe interfaces that correspond to predefined tracking plans. The migration path flows from the maintenance SDK to the current SDK, with automatic data migration capabilities starting in version 1.3.4.

The SDK integrates with native platform capabilities through required dependencies like `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` for data persistence and platform-specific modules for advertising identifier collection (ADID, IDFV, IDFA, AppSetId) and carrier detection.

## Core Nomenclature and Definitions

**Tracking Plan**: Schema definitions in Amplitude Data that specify event structures and properties
**Device ID Lifecycle**: Automatic generation and management of unique device identifiers
**Plugin Architecture**: Extensible system supporting enrichment and destination plugins
**Event Buffer**: Local storage mechanism that batches events before transmission
**Group Properties**: Analytics data associated with user groups rather than individual users
**Revenue Tracking**: Specialized event type for monetary transaction recording
**Session Events**: Automatic tracking of app session start/end events
**COPPA Control**: Privacy compliance features for applications serving children under 13

## Ecosystem Integration

The React Native SDK operates within Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem by connecting to Amplitude Data for schema validation, supporting EU data residency through serverZone configuration, and integrating with the HTTP V2 API for enhanced performance and reliability. The SDK supports both Expo and React Native CLI development workflows, with specific compatibility matrices for different React Native versions and Android Gradle Plugin combinations.

## API Endpoints and Commands

**Core SDK Methods**:
- `init()` - SDK initialization with API key and configuration
- `track()` - Event logging with properties and options
- `identify()` - User property management and updates
- `revenue()` - Monetary transaction tracking
- `flush()` - Manual event buffer transmission
- `setUserId()`, `setDeviceId()`, `setSessionId()` - Identity management
- `groupIdentify()` - Group-level property management
- `setOptOut()` - Privacy control for tracking
- `reset()` - User logout and data clearing

**Ampli CLI Commands**:
- `ampli pull` - Download latest tracking plan schemas
- `ampli status` - Verify implementation against tracking plan

**Ampli Wrapper Methods**:
- `ampli.load()` - Initialize Ampli with configuration
- `ampli.identify()` - Type-safe user identification
- `ampli.track()` - Strongly-typed event tracking
- `ampli.flush()` - Force event transmission

The SDK supports extensive configuration options including batch processing (`useBatch`), queue management (`flushQueueSize`, `flushIntervalMillis`), privacy controls (`TrackingOptions`), debugging (`logLevel`), and data residency (`serverZone`) settings.
