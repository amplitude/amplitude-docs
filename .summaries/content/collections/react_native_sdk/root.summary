The React Native SDK for Amplitude is a comprehensive mobile analytics tracking solution that provides JavaScript and TypeScript support for event tracking, user analytics, and revenue measurement in React Native applications. The SDK offers flexible implementation approaches ranging from basic event tracking to strongly typed APIs with compile-time validation through the Ampli Wrapper integration.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

The React Native SDK ecosystem consists of three interconnected components that represent an evolutionary product strategy:

**Current SDK (`@amplitude/analytics-react-native`)** serves as the primary analytics solution with modern API design, plugin architecture, and comprehensive tracking capabilities. This actively maintained SDK provides the foundation for all new implementations and feature development.

**Maintenance SDK (`@amplitude/react-native`)** represents the legacy solution that continues receiving critical updates but no new features. This SDK maintains backward compatibility for existing implementations while organizations transition to the current SDK.

**Ampli Wrapper** functions as an enhancement layer built on the current SDK, generating strongly typed APIs from Amplitude Data tracking plans. This wrapper provides compile-time validation and structured event schemas for teams requiring strict data governance.

The relationship follows a clear migration path: maintenance SDK → current SDK → Ampli-enhanced SDK, with automatic data migration capabilities starting in v1.3.4 ensuring seamless transitions between versions.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Tracking Interface:**
- `init()`: SDK initialization requiring API key and configuration parameters
- `track()`: Primary event logging method with properties and validation
- `identify()`: User property management using Identify operation objects
- `flush()`: Forces immediate event upload bypassing batching thresholds
- `revenue()`: Specialized revenue event tracking with Revenue interface

**Configuration Management:**
- `trackingOptions`: Controls automatic data collection including IP addresses, device information, and location data
- `serverZone`: Geographic data residency control supporting US and EU regions
- `migrateLegacyData`: Enables automatic data migration from maintenance SDK versions
- `transportProvider`: Custom HTTP client configuration for network request handling

**User and Session Management:**
- `setUserId()`: Associates events with specific user identifiers
- `setDeviceId()`: Manages device-specific tracking identifiers
- `setSessionId()`: Provides manual session management override capabilities
- `groupIdentify()`: Handles group-level property management for B2B analytics use cases

**Advanced Analytics Features:**
- `EnrichmentPlugin`: Enables event data enhancement and transformation
- `DestinationPlugin`: Provides custom event routing and processing capabilities
- Advertising identifiers: ADID, IDFV, IDFA, AppSetId for attribution tracking and marketing analytics

## Ecosystem Integration and Technical Implementation

The SDK integrates with Amplitude's analytics ecosystem through multiple API endpoints and platform services:

**HTTP V2 API** serves as the primary event ingestion endpoint, supporting batch uploads with configurable parameters including `eventUploadThreshold` and `eventUploadPeriodMillis` for optimizing network performance.

**Amplitude Data Integration** connects through the Ampli Wrapper using CLI commands:
- `ampli pull`: Downloads latest tracking plan schemas from Amplitude Data
- `ampli status`: Validates current implementation against defined tracking plans

**Platform Dependencies and Requirements:**
- `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`: Required dependency for local data persistence
- iOS integration requires `pod install` for native module linking
- Android integration requires Gradle compatibility configuration
- TypeScript 2.1+ support with comprehensive type definitions

**Development Environment Support:**
- Expo compatibility for managed workflow applications
- React Native CLI support for bare workflow projects  
- OTA update compatibility enabling dynamic configuration changes
- COPPA compliance controls for applications serving users under 13 years of age

The plugin architecture enables extensibility for custom analytics requirements while maintaining compatibility with Amplitude's core analytics platform. The SDK supports both development and production environments with configurable logging levels, debug modes, and network optimization settings that integrate seamlessly with Amplitude's data pipeline and real-time analytics processing infrastructure.
