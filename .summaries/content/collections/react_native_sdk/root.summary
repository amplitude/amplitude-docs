## Product Overview

The React Native SDK for Amplitude is a comprehensive analytics tracking solution that enables React Native applications to collect, manage, and send user behavior data to Amplitude's analytics platform. The SDK provides strongly-typed event tracking capabilities with support for both JavaScript and TypeScript development environments, featuring a dual-component architecture with the main SDK (`@amplitude/analytics-react-native`) and the Ampli Wrapper for schema-driven development.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

The React Native SDK operates as part of a layered analytics ecosystem with distinct but interconnected components:

**Core SDK Layer**: The foundational `@amplitude/analytics-react-native` package provides basic event tracking, user identification, and data persistence capabilities through React Native's AsyncStorage.

**Ampli Wrapper Layer**: Generates strongly-typed APIs based on Amplitude Data tracking plans, creating a schema-driven development experience that enforces data consistency and validation at compile time.

**Migration Bridge**: The SDK maintains compatibility with legacy implementations through the maintenance version (`@amplitude/react-native`) and provides automatic data migration capabilities starting from v1.3.4.

**Plugin Architecture**: Supports extensibility through two primary plugin types - EnrichmentPlugin for data enhancement and DestinationPlugin for custom data routing, enabling developers to customize data processing workflows.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core SDK Methods and Concepts:**
- `init()`: SDK initialization with API key and configuration parameters
- `track()`: Primary event logging method (supersedes legacy `logEvent()`)
- `identify()`: User property management using Identify operations
- `flush()`: Immediate event upload trigger (replaces `uploadEvents()`)
- `reset()`: User data clearing for logout scenarios

**Configuration Parameters:**
- `flushQueueSize`: Batch size control for event uploads
- `flushIntervalMillis`: Automatic upload frequency timing
- `serverZone`: EU data residency compliance configuration
- `trackingOptions`: Device-specific data collection controls
- `migrateLegacyData`: Legacy SDK data migration enablement

**User and Event Management:**
- **Identify Operations**: `setOnce`, `add`, `prepend`, `append` for granular user property manipulation
- **Group Management**: `setGroup()` and `groupIdentify()` for user segmentation and group-level analytics
- **Revenue Interface**: Dedicated e-commerce tracking with revenue-specific properties
- **Session Management**: `setUserId`, `setDeviceId`, `setSessionId` for user lifecycle tracking

**Ampli-Specific Terminology:**
- **Tracking Plan**: Schema definitions in Amplitude Data that generate type-safe APIs
- **Event Schemas**: Strongly-typed event definitions with built-in property validation
- **CJS Module**: CommonJS packaging format for generated Ampli wrapper distribution

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The React Native SDK serves as a critical bridge between mobile applications and Amplitude's comprehensive analytics platform. It integrates with multiple ecosystem layers:

**Amplitude Data Integration**: Connects directly with Amplitude's schema management system, enabling tracking plan synchronization and strongly-typed API generation through the Ampli CLI workflow.

**Platform-Specific Integrations**: Interfaces with native mobile capabilities including advertising identifiers (ADID, AppSetId, IDFV, IDFA), location services, and platform-specific storage mechanisms.

**Enterprise Features**: Supports advanced compliance requirements through EU data residency controls, COPPA compliance modes, and privacy-focused opt-out mechanisms.

**Development Ecosystem**: Integrates seamlessly with React Native development workflows, supporting standard package managers (npm, yarn, expo), platform-specific build systems (iOS pod install, Android Gradle Plugin), and over-the-air (OTA) update scenarios.

## API Endpoints and Command Line Interface

**Primary SDK API Methods:**
- `ampli.load()`: Ampli wrapper initialization with configuration parameters
- `ampli.identify()`: Type-safe user property updates through wrapper interface
- `ampli.track()`: Strongly-typed event transmission via wrapper
- `ampli.flush()`: Forced event upload through wrapper layer

**CLI Command Interface:**
- `ampli pull`: Downloads latest tracking plan schemas from Amplitude Data
- `ampli status`: Verifies synchronization status between local schemas and Amplitude Data

**Configuration and Control APIs:**
- `setOptOut()`: Privacy compliance through tracking disablement
- `enableCoppaControl()`: COPPA compliance mode activation
- `setEventUploadThreshold()`: Batch upload trigger configuration
- `setEventUploadPeriodMillis()`: Automatic upload interval timing

**Network and Transport Layer:**
The SDK communicates through Amplitude's HTTP V2 API endpoints for data transmission, with support for custom Transport implementations to accommodate specialized networking requirements. Advanced integrations include advertising identifier collection (requiring additional dependencies like play-services-appset for Android) and location tracking capabilities for enhanced user analytics and segmentation.
