The React Native SDK for Amplitude is a comprehensive analytics tracking solution that provides strongly typed event tracking capabilities for React Native applications. The SDK offers both current and maintenance versions, with migration paths and advanced features for enterprise-scale analytics implementation.

## Core Product Features and Architecture

The primary SDK (`@amplitude/analytics-react-native`) delivers event tracking through the HTTP V2 API with TypeScript support and strongly typed interfaces. The architecture centers around three fundamental operations: initialization with `init()`, event tracking via `track()`, and user identification through `identify()`. The SDK requires `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` as a core dependency for local data persistence and supports both iOS and Android platforms with specific Gradle compatibility requirements.

The Ampli Wrapper extends the base SDK functionality by generating strongly typed APIs from Amplitude Data tracking plans, supporting both JavaScript ES6 and TypeScript 2.1+ with CJS module packaging. This wrapper provides compile-time validation of event schemas and properties through generated code that maps directly to defined tracking plans.

## Product Relationships and Integration Points

The SDK ecosystem consists of three primary components working in concert:

**Current SDK** (`@amplitude/analytics-react-native`) serves as the modern implementation with HTTP V2 API support, plugin architecture, and enhanced configuration options including EU data residency through `serverZone` configuration.

**Maintenance SDK** (`@amplitude/react-native`) represents the legacy implementation using `getInstance()` patterns and the older API structure, maintained for backward compatibility but not receiving new features.

**Ampli Wrapper** acts as a code generation layer that creates strongly typed interfaces over either SDK implementation, enabling schema validation and improved developer experience through generated `ampli.load()`, `ampli.identify()`, and `ampli.track()` methods.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Identify Operations**: User property management through the Identify class, supporting operations like `set()`, `add()`, `remove()`, and `clearAll()` for user attribute manipulation.

**Revenue Interface**: Structured revenue tracking with properties including `price`, `quantity`, `productId`, and `revenueType` for e-commerce analytics.

**Plugin Architecture**: Extensible system supporting EnrichmentPlugin and DestinationPlugin types for custom data processing and routing.

**Tracking Options**: Configuration object controlling automatic data collection including advertising identifiers (ADID, AppSetId, IDFV, IDFA), location data (`location_lat`, `location_lng`), and device information.

**Batching Configuration**: Performance optimization through `flushQueueSize` and `flushIntervalMillis` parameters controlling when events are transmitted to Amplitude servers.

## Ecosystem Integration and Data Flow

The SDK integrates with the broader Amplitude ecosystem through multiple touchpoints. The `migrateLegacyData` feature enables seamless transitions from maintenance to current SDK versions, automatically transferring stored user data and device identifiers. EU data residency compliance is achieved through `serverZone` configuration, routing data to European servers when required.

The plugin system enables integration with third-party analytics platforms and custom data processing pipelines. Custom HTTP clients can be implemented through `transportProvider` customization, allowing for proxy configurations or specialized networking requirements.

## API Endpoints and Command Line Interface

The Ampli CLI provides essential commands for tracking plan management:
- `ampli pull` command retrieves the latest tracking plan and regenerates typed interfaces
- `ampli status` command validates local implementation against the current tracking plan

The SDK communicates with Amplitude's HTTP V2 API endpoints, with automatic routing based on `serverZone` configuration for EU data residency compliance. Revenue events utilize specialized endpoints for e-commerce tracking with enhanced validation.

## Platform-Specific Considerations

iOS integration requires `pod install` for dependency management and supports advertising identifier collection through IDFA and IDFV. The SDK handles iOS 16+ deprecation of CTCarrier for carrier information collection.

Android implementation requires specific Gradle compatibility matrix adherence and supports Google Play Services integration for AppSetId and advertising identifier collection through `play-services-appset` and `play-services-ads-identifier` dependencies.

Expo applications require special consideration for over-the-air (OTA) updates, with specific guidance for maintaining analytics continuity during application updates.

The migration documentation provides comprehensive mapping between legacy and current SDK methods, including `getInstance().init()` to `init()`, `logEvent()` to `track()`, and configuration object restructuring for seamless upgrades.
