The React Native SDK for Amplitude is a comprehensive analytics tracking solution designed for React Native applications, providing both JavaScript and TypeScript support for event tracking, user analytics, and revenue measurement. The SDK offers multiple implementation approaches including a standard SDK and an enhanced Ampli Wrapper that generates strongly typed APIs based on Amplitude Data tracking plans.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

The React Native SDK ecosystem consists of three main components:

**Current SDK (`@amplitude/analytics-react-native`)**: The actively maintained, feature-rich analytics SDK that serves as the primary tracking solution. This SDK provides modern API design, plugin architecture, and comprehensive analytics capabilities.

**Maintenance SDK (`@amplitude/react-native`)**: The legacy SDK in maintenance mode that continues to receive critical updates but no new feature development. Organizations using this version are encouraged to migrate to the current SDK.

**Ampli Wrapper**: An enhanced layer built on top of the current SDK that generates strongly typed APIs from Amplitude Data tracking plans, providing compile-time validation and improved developer experience for teams using structured event schemas.

The relationship between these products follows a clear evolution path: legacy maintenance SDK → current SDK → Ampli-enhanced SDK, with automatic data migration capabilities starting in v1.3.4 to ensure seamless transitions.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Tracking Methods:**
- `init()`: SDK initialization with API key and configuration
- `track()`: Event logging with properties and validation
- `identify()`: User property management using Identify operations
- `flush()`: Force immediate event upload to Amplitude servers
- `revenue()`: Revenue event tracking with Revenue interface

**Configuration and Management:**
- `trackingOptions`: Controls automatic data collection (IP, device info, location)
- `serverZone`: Geographic data residency control (US/EU)
- `migrateLegacyData`: Automatic data migration from maintenance SDK
- `transportProvider`: Custom HTTP client configuration for network requests

**User and Device Management:**
- `setUserId()`: User identification and session association
- `setDeviceId()`: Device-specific tracking identifier
- `setSessionId()`: Manual session management override
- `groupIdentify()`: Group-level property management for B2B analytics

**Advanced Features:**
- `EnrichmentPlugin`: Event data enhancement and transformation
- `DestinationPlugin`: Custom event routing and processing
- Advertising identifiers: ADID, IDFV, IDFA, AppSetId for attribution tracking

## Ecosystem Integration and API Endpoints

The SDK integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem through multiple API endpoints and services:

**HTTP V2 API**: Primary event ingestion endpoint supporting batch uploads with configurable thresholds (`eventUploadThreshold`, `eventUploadPeriodMillis`)

**Amplitude Data Integration**: The Ampli Wrapper connects with Amplitude Data's tracking plan management system, using CLI commands:
- `ampli pull`: Downloads latest tracking plan schemas
- `ampli status`: Validates implementation against tracking plan

**Platform Dependencies**: 
- `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage`: Required for local data persistence
- Platform-specific integrations for iOS (pod install) and Android (Gradle compatibility)

**Development Workflow Integration**:
- Expo compatibility for managed workflow applications
- React Native CLI support for bare workflow projects
- OTA update compatibility for dynamic configuration changes
- TypeScript 2.1+ support with strongly typed interfaces

The SDK supports both development and production environments with configurable logging levels, debug modes, and COPPA compliance controls for applications serving users under 13 years of age. The plugin architecture enables extensibility for custom analytics requirements while maintaining compatibility with Amplitude's core analytics platform and data pipeline.
