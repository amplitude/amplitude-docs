# Amplitude React Native SDK

## Overview

The Amplitude React Native SDK is a client-side analytics solution that enables mobile application developers to track user behavior and events in React Native applications. The SDK supports both JavaScript and TypeScript applications, providing a comprehensive set of features for event tracking, user identification, revenue tracking, session management, and data synchronization with Amplitude's analytics platform.

The SDK is available in two versions:
1. The latest SDK (`@amplitude/analytics-react-native`) - The recommended version with a modern plugin architecture
2. The maintenance SDK (`@amplitude/react-native`) - The legacy version that is still supported but not actively developed

Key features include:
- Event tracking with custom properties
- User identification and property management
- Revenue tracking
- Session management
- Batch event uploading
- EU data residency support
- COPPA compliance controls
- Plugin architecture for extensibility
- Strongly typed API through Ampli Wrapper

## Product Relationships and Features

### Core SDK Components

1. **Main SDK Package**
   - Latest: `@amplitude/analytics-react-native`
   - Maintenance: `@amplitude/react-native`

2. **Ampli Wrapper**
   - A code-generated wrapper that provides type-safe event tracking based on your Amplitude Data tracking plan
   - Supports both JavaScript and TypeScript applications

3. **Plugins**
   - The latest SDK uses a plugin architecture for extensibility
   - Allows for custom functionality and integration with other services

### Feature Comparison

| Feature | Latest SDK | Maintenance SDK |
|---------|------------|-----------------|
| Event Tracking | `track()` | `logEvent()` |
| User Identification | `identify()` | `identify()` |
| Revenue Tracking | `revenue()` | `logRevenueV2()` |
| Session Management | Automatic | Configurable |
| Batch Processing | Supported | Supported |
| EU Data Residency | Supported | Supported |
| COPPA Compliance | Supported | Supported |
| Plugin Architecture | Yes | No |
| TypeScript Support | Full | Limited |
| Flush Events | `flush()` | `uploadEvents()` |

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Event** - A user action or occurrence that is tracked in the application
   
2. **User Properties** - Attributes associated with a user that persist across sessions

3. **Identify API** - Methods for setting, incrementing, appending, or otherwise modifying user properties

4. **Session** - A period of user engagement with the application

5. **Device ID** - A unique identifier for the device running the application

6. **User ID** - A unique identifier for the user, typically set by the application

7. **Tracking Plan** - A schema that defines the events and properties to be tracked

8. **Ampli Wrapper** - A code-generated client that provides type-safe event tracking based on a tracking plan

9. **Plugin** - An extension that adds functionality to the SDK

10. **COPPA** - Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, which imposes requirements on operators of websites or online services directed to children under 13 years of age

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The React Native SDK integrates with the broader Amplitude ecosystem in several ways:

1. **Amplitude Analytics Platform** - The SDK sends event data to Amplitude's analytics platform for processing and visualization

2. **Amplitude Data** - The SDK can be used with Amplitude Data to implement tracking plans and ensure data quality

3. **Ampli CLI** - A command-line tool that generates the Ampli Wrapper based on your tracking plan

4. **Cross-Platform Support** - The SDK is part of Amplitude's cross-platform strategy, with similar SDKs available for other platforms

5. **HTTP V2 API** - The SDK uses Amplitude's HTTP V2 API for sending events to the backend
