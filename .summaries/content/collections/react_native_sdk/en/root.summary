The React Native SDK for Amplitude is a comprehensive analytics tracking solution that enables React Native applications to collect, manage, and send user behavior data to Amplitude's analytics platform. The SDK provides strongly-typed event tracking capabilities with support for both JavaScript and TypeScript development environments.

## Core Features and Architecture

The SDK consists of two primary components: the main React Native SDK (`@amplitude/analytics-react-native`) and the Ampli Wrapper, which generates strongly-typed APIs based on Amplitude Data tracking plans. The SDK requires `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` as a dependency for local data persistence and supports both current and maintenance versions to accommodate different migration timelines.

The architecture centers around a plugin system that supports two main plugin types: EnrichmentPlugin for data enhancement and DestinationPlugin for custom data routing. The SDK utilizes the HTTP V2 API endpoint for data transmission and includes a configurable Transport interface for custom HTTP client implementations.

## Product Relationships and Integration

The React Native SDK integrates with several Amplitude ecosystem components:

- **Amplitude Data**: Provides tracking plan schemas that generate strongly-typed Ampli wrapper APIs
- **Amplitude Analytics Platform**: Receives and processes event data through HTTP V2 API endpoints
- **Device-level Integration**: Connects with platform-specific advertising identifiers (ADID, AppSetId, IDFV, IDFA) and location services
- **Development Tools**: Integrates with Ampli CLI commands (`ampli pull`, `ampli status`) for schema management

The SDK supports both current (`@amplitude/analytics-react-native`) and maintenance (`@amplitude/react-native`) versions, with automatic data migration capabilities starting from v1.3.4.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core SDK Methods:**
- `init()`: Initializes the SDK with API key and configuration options
- `track()`: Logs events with optional properties (replaces legacy `logEvent()`)
- `identify()`: Sets user properties using Identify operations
- `flush()`: Forces immediate upload of queued events (replaces `uploadEvents()`)
- `reset()`: Clears user data for logout scenarios

**Configuration Concepts:**
- `flushQueueSize`: Controls batching behavior for event uploads
- `flushIntervalMillis`: Sets automatic upload frequency
- `serverZone`: Configures EU data residency compliance
- `trackingOptions`: Controls collection of device-specific data
- `migrateLegacyData`: Enables automatic migration from maintenance SDK

**User and Event Management:**
- **Identify Operations**: `setOnce`, `add`, `prepend`, `append` for user property manipulation
- **Group Management**: `setGroup()` and `groupIdentify()` for user segmentation
- **Revenue Tracking**: Dedicated Revenue interface for e-commerce analytics
- **Session Management**: `setUserId`, `setDeviceId`, `setSessionId` for user lifecycle tracking

**Ampli-Specific Terms:**
- **Tracking Plan**: Schema definition in Amplitude Data that generates typed APIs
- **Event Schemas**: Strongly-typed event definitions with property validation
- **CJS Module**: CommonJS packaging format for the generated Ampli wrapper

## Broader Ecosystem Integration

The React Native SDK operates within Amplitude's comprehensive analytics ecosystem by connecting mobile applications to the broader Amplitude platform. It supports enterprise features like EU data residency through server zone configuration and COPPA compliance controls for applications serving minors.

The SDK integrates with React Native's development ecosystem through standard package managers (npm, yarn, expo) and supports platform-specific build systems (iOS pod install, Android Gradle Plugin). It maintains compatibility matrices for different React Native versions and handles over-the-air (OTA) update scenarios.

## API Endpoints and Command Line Interface

**Primary SDK Methods:**
- `ampli.load()`: Initializes the Ampli wrapper with configuration
- `ampli.identify()`: Updates user properties through the wrapper
- `ampli.track()`: Sends strongly-typed events via the wrapper
- `ampli.flush()`: Forces event upload through the wrapper

**CLI Commands:**
- `ampli pull`: Downloads latest tracking plan schemas
- `ampli status`: Checks synchronization status with Amplitude Data

**Configuration APIs:**
- `setOptOut()`: Disables tracking for privacy compliance
- `enableCoppaControl()`: Enables COPPA compliance mode
- `setEventUploadThreshold()`: Configures batch upload triggers
- `setEventUploadPeriodMillis()`: Sets automatic upload intervals

The SDK communicates with Amplitude's HTTP V2 API endpoints for data transmission and supports custom Transport implementations for specialized networking requirements. Advanced features include advertising identifier collection (requiring additional dependencies like play-services-appset for Android) and location tracking capabilities for enhanced user analytics.
