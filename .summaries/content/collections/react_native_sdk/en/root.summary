The React Native SDK for Amplitude is a comprehensive analytics tracking solution that provides strongly-typed event tracking capabilities for React Native applications. The SDK offers both a current version (`@amplitude/analytics-react-native`) and a maintenance version (`@amplitude/react-native`), with migration paths and tooling to transition between versions.

## Core Features and Architecture

The SDK centers around three primary components: event tracking, user management, and data enrichment. Event tracking is handled through the `track()` method for logging custom events with properties, while user management utilizes the Identify class for setting user properties through operations like `setOnce`, `add`, `prepend`, and `append`. The SDK supports advanced features including revenue tracking via the Revenue interface, group analytics through `setGroup()` and `groupIdentify()`, and session management with configurable session tracking.

The architecture employs a plugin system supporting EnrichmentPlugin and DestinationPlugin types, allowing for data transformation and custom destination routing. The SDK communicates with Amplitude's HTTP V2 API and includes a configurable Transport interface for custom HTTP client implementations.

## Ampli Integration and Code Generation

The Ampli Wrapper generates strongly-typed APIs based on Amplitude Data tracking plans, supporting both JavaScript ES6 and TypeScript 2.1+ with CJS module packaging. Key Ampli methods include `ampli.load()` for initialization, `ampli.identify()` for user identification, `ampli.track()` for event tracking with schema validation, and `ampli.flush()` for immediate data transmission. The Ampli CLI provides commands like `ampli pull` for downloading tracking plans and `ampli status` for validation checking.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**SDK Versions**: The current SDK (`@amplitude/analytics-react-native`) replaces the maintenance SDK (`@amplitude/react-native`) with API method changes including `getInstance()/init()` becoming `init()`, `logEvent()` becoming `track()`, and `uploadEvents()` becoming `flush()`.

**Configuration Options**: 
- `flushQueueSize` and `flushIntervalMillis` control batching behavior
- `serverZone` enables EU data residency compliance
- `trackingOptions` configures optional data collection
- `migrateLegacyData` enables automatic data migration from legacy SDK versions

**User Management**: The Identify class handles user property operations, while `setUserId()`, `setDeviceId()`, and `setSessionId()` manage user identity. The `reset()` method handles user logout scenarios, and `setOptOut()` provides tracking disable functionality.

**Advertising Identifiers**: The SDK supports ADID (Android Advertising ID), AppSetId, IDFV (iOS Identifier for Vendors), and IDFA (iOS Identifier for Advertisers) with appropriate dependency requirements like `play-services-appset`.

## Installation and Dependencies

Installation requires the core package plus `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` for data persistence. Platform-specific setup includes `pod install` for iOS and Gradle configuration for Android. The SDK maintains compatibility matrices for React Native versions and Android Gradle Plugin versions.

## Migration and Compatibility

Migration from the maintenance SDK involves package updates, API method changes, and configuration adjustments. Starting with v1.3.4, automatic data migration is available through the `migrateLegacyData` configuration option. The migration process includes transitioning from HTTP V1 to HTTP V2 API endpoints and adopting the new plugin architecture.

## Advanced Features

The SDK supports COPPA control through `enableCoppaControl()`, EU data residency via server zone configuration, and OTA (over-the-air) update considerations. Location tracking and advertising identifier collection are configurable through tracking options. The plugin system enables custom data enrichment and destination routing, while the Transport interface allows for custom HTTP client implementations.

Revenue tracking utilizes dedicated Revenue objects with properties for price, quantity, and product identification. Group analytics enable tracking of user groups and group-level properties through specialized identify operations.
