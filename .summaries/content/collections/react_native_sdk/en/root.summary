# Amplitude React Native SDK Product Overview

## Product Overview

The Amplitude React Native SDK is an analytics tracking solution that enables developers to capture user behavior data in React Native applications. The SDK provides a comprehensive set of tools for tracking events, managing user properties, handling sessions, and implementing advanced analytics features. The product is designed to integrate seamlessly with React Native applications, offering both JavaScript and TypeScript support.

## Key Features and Concepts

1. **Event Tracking**: Core functionality to log user actions and behaviors
2. **User Identification**: Methods to identify users and track their properties
3. **Revenue Tracking**: Specialized tracking for revenue-related events
4. **Session Management**: Automatic and manual session tracking capabilities
5. **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible system for customizing SDK behavior
6. **Batch Event Processing**: Efficient handling of multiple events
7. **Data Privacy Controls**: COPPA compliance and EU data residency options
8. **Ampli Wrapper**: Strongly-typed API based on tracking plans

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Amplitude React Native SDK ecosystem consists of two main packages:

1. **Maintenance SDK** (`@amplitude/react-native`): The older version that is still supported but not actively developed
2. **Latest SDK** (`@amplitude/analytics-react-native`): The current, actively developed version with enhanced features and plugin architecture

The latest SDK uses a plugin-based architecture that allows for greater customization and extensibility. Core functionality is provided through the base SDK, while additional capabilities can be added through plugins.

The SDK also integrates with the **Ampli Wrapper**, which provides a strongly-typed layer on top of the SDK based on a tracking plan defined in Amplitude. This ensures consistent event tracking across the application and prevents instrumentation errors.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: A user action or occurrence tracked in the application
- **User Properties**: Attributes associated with a specific user
- **Identify**: API for setting or modifying user properties
- **Group**: A collection of users that can have shared properties
- **Session**: A period of user activity in the application
- **Device ID**: Unique identifier for a device
- **User ID**: Custom identifier for a user
- **Plugin**: Extension module that adds functionality to the SDK
- **Tracking Plan**: Schema defining events and properties to be tracked
- **COPPA**: Children's Online Privacy Protection Act compliance controls
- **EU Data Residency**: Option to route data to EU servers for compliance

## Integration with Amplitude Ecosystem

The React Native SDK is part of Amplitude's broader analytics platform. It sends tracked events to Amplitude's servers where they can be analyzed using Amplitude's analytics tools. The SDK supports:

1. **HTTP V2 API**: For sending events to Amplitude's servers
2. **EU Data Residency**: Option to route data to EU-based servers
3. **Tracking Plan Integration**: Works with Amplitude's tracking plan feature for consistent event tracking

The SDK can be used alongside other Amplitude products and integrates with the Amplitude dashboard for visualization and analysis of tracked data.

## API Endpoints and Implementation

### Installation

```bash
# For the latest SDK
npm install @amplitude/analytics-react-native

# For the maintenance SDK
npm install @amplitude/react-native
```

### Initialization

Latest SDK:
```javascript
import { Amplitude, Types } from '@amplitude/analytics-react-native';

Amplitude.init('API_KEY', {
  // Configuration options
});
```

Maintenance SDK:
```javascript
import { Amplitude } from '@amplitude/react-native';

Amplitude.getInstance().init('API_KEY', {
  // Configuration options
});
```

### Event Tracking

Latest SDK:
```javascript
Amplitude.track('Event Name', {
  property1: 'value1',
  property2: 'value2'
});
```

Maintenance SDK:
```javascript
Amplitude.getInstance().logEvent('Event Name', {
  property1: 'value1',
  property2: 'value2'
});
```

### User Identification

Latest SDK:
```javascript
Amplitude.setUserId('user_id');

// Set user properties
Amplitude.identify(
  new Types.Identify()
    .set('property1', 'value1')
    .add('property2', 1)
);
```

Maintenance SDK:
```javascript
Amplitude.getInstance().setUserId('user_id');

// Set user properties
const identify = new Amplitude.Identify();
identify.set('property1', 'value1');
identify.add('property2', 1);
Amplitude.getInstance().identify(identify);
```

### Revenue Tracking

Latest SDK:
```javascript
Amplitude.revenue({
  price: 10.99,
  quantity: 2,
  productId: 'product_id'
});
```

Maintenance SDK:
```javascript
const revenue = new Amplitude.Revenue()
  .setPrice(10.99)
  .setQuantity(2)
  .setProductId('product_id');
Amplitude.getInstance().logRevenueV2(revenue);
```

### Batch Event Processing

Latest SDK:
```javascript
Amplitude.flush();
```

Maintenance SDK:
```javascript
Amplitude.getInstance().uploadEvents();
```

### Ampli Wrapper Usage

```javascript
import { ampli } from './ampli';

// Initialize
ampli.load({ client: { apiKey: 'API_KEY' } });

// Track event defined in tracking plan
ampli.eventName({
  requiredProperty: 'value',
  optionalProperty: 123
});
```

The React Native SDK provides comprehensive analytics capabilities for React Native applications, with two versions available to accommodate different needs and a strongly-typed wrapper for enforcing tracking plans.
