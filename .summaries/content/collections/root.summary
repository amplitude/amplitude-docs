Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven decision making. The platform consists of four core products: Analytics for behavioral analysis, Experiment for feature flagging and A/B testing, Session Replay for user experience insights, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP) for data management and activation.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem is built around a unified data foundation that connects analytics instrumentation, experimentation, and data management capabilities:

**Analytics Core** serves as the primary behavioral analytics engine, featuring multiple specialized chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Revenue LTV, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Data Tables, and Compass. These charts work together to provide comprehensive user behavior insights across the entire customer journey.

**Experiment Platform** integrates deeply with Analytics through automatic event tracking, generating `[Experiment] Assignment` events for comprehensive experiment analysis. The platform operates through dual API layers - Evaluation APIs for real-time variant assignment and Management APIs for administrative control over flags, experiments, deployments, and traffic allocation.

**Session Replay** captures and reconstructs user sessions, providing qualitative context to quantitative analytics insights. This enables teams to understand not just what users do, but how they experience the product.

**Customer Data Platform** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation through source and destination catalogs, audience management, and warehouse-native capabilities. The CDP ensures data consistency across all Amplitude products and external integrations.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events and Properties**: The fundamental data model where events represent user actions and properties provide contextual information about users, events, and groups.

**Cohorts and Audiences**: User segments created from behavioral criteria that can be used across analytics, experimentation, and activation workflows.

**Deployments**: Environment contexts in Experiment where flags and experiments are assigned, supporting both client-side and server-side evaluation modes.

**Variants and Bucketing**: Experiment configurations that determine user assignment to different feature versions through bucketing keys (amplitude_id, device_id, user_id) and traffic allocation percentages.

**Mutex Groups and Holdouts**: Traffic management systems that prevent experiment overlap through slot-based allocation and maintain control populations for measuring overall experimentation impact.

**Sources and Destinations**: CDP components that handle data ingestion from various platforms and data activation to downstream tools and systems.

**Instrumentation**: The process of implementing tracking code through various SDKs to capture user behavior data.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude operates as a unified platform where data flows seamlessly between products. Analytics data informs experiment targeting and audience creation, while experiment results feed back into analytics for impact measurement. Session Replay provides qualitative context to quantitative insights, and the CDP ensures data consistency across all touchpoints.

The platform supports multi-region deployments with dedicated endpoints for data residency compliance (US: `api.amplitude.com`, EU: `api.eu.amplitude.com`) and integrates with hundreds of third-party tools through source and destination catalogs.

**Partner Ecosystem** extends functionality through integrations with marketing, product, and data tools, enabling organizations to activate Amplitude insights across their entire technology stack.

## API Specifications and Technical Implementation

**Analytics API** (`/api/2/`) provides programmatic access to event data, user properties, and behavioral insights with endpoints for data export, user lookup, and cohort management.

**Experiment APIs** operate through two layers:
- **Evaluation API** (`/v1/vardata`, `/v1/flags`) for real-time variant assignment and flag configuration downloads
- **Management API** (`/api/1/`) for administrative operations across flags, experiments, deployments, holdouts, and traffic allocation

**Guides and Surveys API** enables programmatic management of in-product messaging and feedback collection.

**SDK Ecosystem** provides comprehensive instrumentation support across platforms:
- **Client-side SDKs**: Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal
- **Server-side SDKs**: Node.js, Python, Java, Go
- **Ampli**: Type-safe analytics implementation tool that generates strongly-typed tracking libraries

The platform implements cursor-based pagination, enforces rate limiting (typically 100 requests/second), and provides comprehensive error handling across all API endpoints. Authentication varies by product area, using API keys for management operations and deployment keys for evaluation services.
