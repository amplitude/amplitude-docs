## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event** - A discrete user action or system occurrence tracked in Amplitude
- **User** - An individual using the product, identified by a unique ID
- **Session** - A period of continuous user activity
- **Property** - Metadata attached to events or users
- **Cohort** - A group of users who share common characteristics or behaviors
- **Funnel** - A sequence of events representing a conversion path
- **Retention** - Measurement of users returning to the product over time
- **SDK** (Software Development Kit) - Client libraries for implementing Amplitude
- **API** (Application Programming Interface) - Programmatic access points
- **Experiment** - A controlled test comparing variations of a feature
- **Feature Flag** - Toggle for enabling/disabling features for specific users
- **Session Replay** - Visual recording of user interactions with a product
- **Masking** - Privacy protection in Session Replay that hides sensitive content
- **Data Source** - Origin point for data imported into Amplitude
- **Destination** - Target system for data exported from Amplitude

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude platform is designed as an integrated ecosystem where components work together:

1. **Data Collection** - SDKs and APIs capture user behavior across platforms
2. **Data Processing** - Raw data is processed, enriched, and stored
3. **Analysis** - Various chart types and tools analyze the processed data
4. **Activation** - Insights drive actions through experiments and integrations
5. **Optimization** - Results feed back into the product development cycle

The platform supports a multi-site architecture with localization for English and Japanese, and features like data residency controls for regulatory compliance.

## API Endpoints and Implementation

### SDK Implementation Patterns
```javascript
// Browser SDK with Session Replay
import * as amplitude from '@amplitude/analytics-browser';
import { sessionReplayPlugin } from '@amplitude/plugin-session-replay-browser';

amplitude.init('API_KEY', {
  plugins: [sessionReplayPlugin({
    sampleRate: 1.0,
    maskAllInputs: true
  })]
});

// Event tracking
amplitude.track('Button Clicked', {
  buttonName: 'Submit',
  pageLocation: 'Signup Form'
});
```

### Experiment Implementation
```javascript
// Web experiment implementation
import { Experiment } from '@amplitude/experiment-js-client';

const experiment = Experiment.initialize({
  apiKey: 'DEPLOYMENT_KEY',
  user: {
    user_id: 'user@example.com'
  }
});

const variant = await experiment.fetch();
const buttonColor = variant.buttonColor?.value || 'blue';
```
