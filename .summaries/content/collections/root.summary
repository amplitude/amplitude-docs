# Amplitude Product Suite

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics platform that helps organizations understand user behavior, optimize digital experiences, and drive business growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of several integrated products and features designed to collect, analyze, visualize, and activate user data across multiple channels.

## Core Products and Features

### Analytics
Amplitude Analytics is the foundation of the platform, providing tools to track and analyze user behavior across digital products. Key features include:
- Event tracking and segmentation for analyzing specific user actions
- Funnel analysis for tracking conversion paths and identifying drop-offs
- Retention analysis for measuring how users continue to engage over time
- Path analysis for understanding user navigation patterns
- Behavioral cohorts for grouping users based on actions and properties
- Custom dashboards and notebooks for sharing insights

The platform offers various chart types organized around business goals (Know, Convert, Retain, Monetize), including event segmentation, funnel analysis, retention analysis, revenue LTV, user sessions, and engagement matrix.

### Data
Amplitude Data provides tools for data collection, management, and governance:
- Tracking plan creation and management for consistent analytics implementation
- Data validation and quality monitoring
- Ampli developer toolkit for type-safe implementation
- Transformations and derived properties for data enrichment
- Warehouse-native capabilities for direct data warehouse querying
- Source and destination integrations for connecting with other platforms

### Experiment
Amplitude Experiment enables feature flagging and A/B testing:
- Feature flag management for controlled rollouts
- A/B testing with statistical analysis
- Multi-armed bandit experiments for optimization
- Local and remote evaluation options for performance flexibility
- Bucketing algorithms for consistent user experiences
- Sequential testing methodology for faster experiment results

### Session Replay
Amplitude Session Replay provides visual recordings of user sessions:
- Video-like playback of user interactions
- Heatmaps showing click, scroll, and interaction patterns
- Privacy controls with configurable masking levels
- Cross-platform support (Web, iOS, Android, React Native)
- Integration with analytics events for context

### Guides and Surveys
Amplitude Guides and Surveys enables in-product messaging and feedback collection:
- Multiple form factors (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner)
- Audience targeting based on user properties and behaviors
- Customizable themes and localization
- Performance analytics for engagement metrics
- A/B testing capabilities for optimizing messaging

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Events**: User actions tracked in Amplitude (page views, clicks, purchases)
- **Event Properties**: Contextual attributes associated with events
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes associated with users
- **Cohorts**: Groups of users defined by specific behaviors or attributes
- **Sessions**: Periods of continuous user activity
- **Monthly Tracked Users (MTU)**: Unique users tracked per month (billing metric)
- **Variants**: Different versions of a feature in experiments
- **Bucketing**: Process of assigning users to experiment variants
- **Tracking Plan**: Schema defining expected events and properties
- **Ampli Wrapper**: Generated code providing type-safe analytics implementation

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's products form an integrated ecosystem:

1. **Data Collection**: SDKs for various platforms (Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Unity, etc.) collect user behavior data
2. **Data Processing**: Amplitude Data validates and processes incoming events
3. **Analysis**: Analytics tools visualize and derive insights from the data
4. **Experimentation**: Experiment uses analytics data to test hypotheses
5. **Engagement**: Guides and Surveys activate insights through targeted messaging
6. **Visualization**: Session Replay provides qualitative context to quantitative data

The platform supports both client-side and server-side implementations, with SDKs available for all major development platforms. The Ampli CLI and wrapper provide type-safe implementation based on tracking plans defined in Amplitude Data.

Amplitude integrates with various third-party platforms through source and destination catalogs, enabling data import from external sources and export of cohorts and events to activation platforms.

The product is available in different tiers (Growth, Enterprise) with varying feature availability, and offers specialized add-ons for advanced capabilities like Session Replay and group-level analytics.
