Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools for product analytics, feature experimentation, customer data management, and user engagement optimization. The platform serves as an integrated ecosystem for understanding user behavior, testing product changes, and driving data-driven decision making across web and mobile applications.

## Core Product Architecture and Relationships

### Primary Product Modules
The Amplitude ecosystem consists of four main product areas that work together to provide end-to-end analytics and optimization capabilities:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, providing event tracking, user segmentation, and behavioral analysis through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, Cohort Analysis, and User Journey mapping. The analytics platform supports real-time data processing and offers advanced features like Compass (automated insights), Personas (behavioral cohorts), and Revenue LTV analysis.

**Amplitude Experiment** enables feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities, allowing teams to safely deploy features and measure their impact. This includes advanced experimentation techniques, statistical analysis, and integration with the analytics platform for comprehensive experiment evaluation.

**Amplitude CDP (Customer Data Platform)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation across the customer journey. It includes source and destination catalogs for third-party integrations, audience management, and data governance features including PII handling and warehouse-native capabilities.

**Amplitude Session Replay** provides user session recording and analysis capabilities, enabling teams to understand user interactions at a granular level and identify optimization opportunities.

### Supporting Infrastructure
The platform includes several supporting components:
- **Amplitude Guides and Surveys** for in-product user engagement and feedback collection
- **Ampli** for type-safe analytics implementation and data governance
- **Comprehensive SDK ecosystem** supporting web, mobile, and server-side implementations
- **API infrastructure** for programmatic access to analytics data and experiment management

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

### Analytics Concepts
- **Events**: User actions tracked within applications, forming the foundation of all analytics
- **Properties**: Attributes associated with events and users that enable segmentation and analysis
- **Cohorts**: Groups of users defined by shared characteristics or behaviors
- **Funnels**: Sequential user flows that measure conversion rates between steps
- **Retention**: Measurement of user return behavior over specified time periods
- **Stickiness**: Frequency of user engagement within defined time windows

### Experimentation Terminology
- **Feature Flags**: Boolean controls that enable/disable features for specific user segments
- **Variants**: Different versions of features or experiences being tested
- **Bucketing**: Process of assigning users to experiment groups
- **Statistical Significance**: Confidence level that observed differences are not due to chance
- **Lift**: Percentage improvement of a variant compared to control

### Data Management Terms
- **Sources**: Systems that send data into Amplitude (mobile apps, websites, servers)
- **Destinations**: External systems that receive data from Amplitude
- **Transformations**: Data processing rules applied during ingestion or export
- **Audiences**: Dynamically updated user segments that can be synced to external systems
- **Warehouse-native**: Architecture that processes data directly within customer data warehouses

### Technical Infrastructure
- **SDKs (Software Development Kits)**: Client libraries for implementing Amplitude tracking
- **APIs**: RESTful interfaces for programmatic access to platform functionality
- **Agents**: Server-side components for data collection and processing
- **Mount Points**: Content management system references for organizing documentation

## SDK Ecosystem and Implementation

The platform provides extensive SDK coverage across platforms and programming languages:

### Client-Side SDKs
- **Browser SDK**: JavaScript implementation for web applications with advanced features like session replay integration
- **Mobile SDKs**: Native implementations for iOS (Swift/Objective-C) and Android (Java/Kotlin)
- **Cross-Platform SDKs**: React Native, Flutter, and Unity for hybrid mobile development
- **Game Engine SDKs**: Unity and Unreal Engine for gaming applications

### Server-Side SDKs
- **Node.js SDK**: JavaScript/TypeScript implementation for server-side tracking
- **Python SDK**: Full-featured implementation for Python applications
- **Java SDK**: Enterprise-grade implementation for Java applications
- **Go SDK**: Lightweight implementation for Go applications

### Implementation Patterns
All SDKs follow consistent patterns for initialization, event tracking, user identification, and configuration management. They support both synchronous and asynchronous operation modes, automatic retry logic, and local storage for offline scenarios.

## API Infrastructure and Endpoints

### Analytics APIs
The Analytics API provides programmatic access to event data, user profiles, and computed metrics. Key endpoints include:
- Event ingestion endpoints for real-time data collection
- Query APIs for retrieving aggregated analytics data
- User profile APIs for accessing individual user data
- Export APIs for bulk data extraction

### Experiment APIs
Experiment APIs enable programmatic experiment management and evaluation:
- Flag evaluation endpoints for real-time feature flag resolution
- Experiment configuration APIs for managing experiment setup
- Results APIs for accessing experiment performance data
- Assignment APIs for tracking user experiment participation

### Data Management APIs
CDP functionality is exposed through APIs for:
- Source and destination configuration management
- Audience definition and synchronization
- Data transformation rule management
- Real-time data streaming interfaces
