# Amplitude Analytics and Experimentation Platform

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides product teams with tools for user behavior analysis, feature experimentation, data management, and customer journey optimization. The platform consists of multiple integrated products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The platform is organized around several core product areas that work together to provide end-to-end product analytics and optimization capabilities:

**Analytics Core** serves as the foundation, providing event tracking, user segmentation, and behavioral analysis through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Revenue LTV, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Data Tables, and Compass. These charts enable teams to understand user behavior patterns, conversion funnels, and product performance metrics.

**Amplitude Experiment** integrates with the analytics platform to provide feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities. It includes advanced techniques, experiment theory, workflow management, troubleshooting tools, and results analysis. The experiment platform supports both remote and local evaluation modes with comprehensive APIs for flag management and variant assignment.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation through source and destination catalogs, audience management, and warehouse-native capabilities. The CDP connects to the broader ecosystem through extensive integrations and supports PII management for privacy compliance.

**Session Replay** provides detailed user session recordings and analysis, while **Guides and Surveys** enables in-product messaging and user feedback collection. These products complement the core analytics by providing qualitative insights alongside quantitative data.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events and Properties**: The fundamental data model consists of events (user actions) and properties (attributes describing events, users, or groups). Events are tracked through various SDKs and APIs.

**Charts and Analysis Types**: 
- *Event Segmentation*: Measures event volume and property breakdowns
- *Funnel Analysis*: Tracks conversion through sequential steps
- *Retention Analysis*: Measures user return behavior over time
- *Cohort Analysis*: Groups users by shared characteristics or behaviors
- *Journeys*: Maps user paths through product experiences
- *Personas*: Creates behavioral user segments

**Experimentation Terms**:
- *Feature Flags*: Configuration controls for feature rollouts
- *Variants*: Different versions tested in experiments
- *Bucketing*: User assignment to experiment groups
- *Holdout Groups*: Control populations for measuring experiment impact
- *Mutex Groups*: Traffic allocation management to prevent experiment overlap

**Data Management**:
- *Sources*: Data ingestion points from various platforms
- *Destinations*: Data activation endpoints for marketing and analytics tools
- *Audiences*: User segments that can be synced to external platforms
- *Transformations*: Data processing and enrichment capabilities

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The platform integrates extensively with external tools through its source and destination catalogs, supporting hundreds of integrations across marketing, analytics, and business intelligence platforms. The CDP enables bi-directional data flow, allowing teams to both collect data from various sources and activate insights through downstream tools.

**Multi-site and Localization**: The platform supports multiple site configurations (English and Japanese) with localized content and region-specific deployments including US and EU data residency options.

**Partner Ecosystem**: Amplitude maintains partnerships with various technology providers, enabling extended functionality and integration capabilities across the product development and marketing technology stack.

## API Specifications and Technical Implementation

**Analytics APIs** provide programmatic access to event ingestion, user management, and data export capabilities through REST endpoints at `/apis/analytics/`.

**Experiment APIs** offer comprehensive experiment management through:
- Evaluation API: `/v1/vardata` for variant assignments, `/v1/flags` for flag configurations
- Management API: CRUD operations for flags, experiments, deployments, mutex groups, and holdout groups
- Authentication via API keys for evaluation and bearer tokens for management

**SDK Coverage** spans multiple platforms and languages:
- **Client-side**: Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal
- **Server-side**: Node.js, Python, Java, Go
- **Specialized**: Ampli (type-safe analytics), various experiment SDKs

**Data Collection Routes** follow consistent URL patterns:
- Analytics SDKs: `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/`
- Experiment SDKs: `/sdks/experiment-sdks/`
- APIs: `/apis/{product}/`
- Charts and analysis: `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/`

The platform supports both real-time and batch data processing, with comprehensive instrumentation guidance, migration tools, and troubleshooting resources. Administrative features include account management, billing controls, single sign-on integration, and granular access controls across the entire platform.
