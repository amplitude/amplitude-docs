Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment (feature flagging and A/B testing), Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Product Architecture and Core Components

### Analytics Platform
The Analytics core provides event tracking, user segmentation, and behavioral analysis through multiple chart types and visualization tools. Key components include:

**Chart Types**: Event Segmentation for basic analytics, Funnel Analysis for conversion tracking, Retention Analysis for user engagement measurement, Cohort analysis through Lifecycle charts, User journey mapping via Journeys, Engagement Matrix for feature adoption, Impact Analysis for measuring changes, Stickiness for usage frequency, Revenue LTV for monetization tracking, User Sessions for session-based analysis, Personas for user clustering, and Data Tables for raw data exploration.

**Compass**: An AI-powered insights engine that automatically surfaces significant trends, anomalies, and opportunities within user data.

### Experimentation Platform (Amplitude Experiment)
A comprehensive A/B testing and feature flagging solution with advanced statistical capabilities:

**Core Features**: Feature flag management, multivariate testing, advanced targeting and segmentation, statistical analysis with sequential testing, and experiment result visualization.

**Advanced Capabilities**: Mutual exclusion groups, holdout testing, advanced statistical techniques, and integration with analytics for comprehensive impact measurement.

### Session Replay
Provides user session recording and playback capabilities to understand user interactions and identify friction points in the product experience.

### Guides and Surveys
An in-product messaging and feedback collection system that enables contextual user engagement and data collection.

### Customer Data Platform (CDP)
A comprehensive data management solution including:

**Data Sources**: Integration with 100+ data sources through the Source Catalog, supporting real-time streaming and batch data ingestion.

**Destinations**: 200+ integrations through the Destination Catalog for data activation and synchronization across marketing, analytics, and operational tools.

**Audiences**: Dynamic user segmentation with real-time updates and cross-platform activation.

**Data Governance**: PII management, data quality monitoring, and compliance tools.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Core Analytics Concepts
- **Events**: User actions tracked within applications (clicks, page views, purchases)
- **Properties**: Attributes associated with events (event properties) or users (user properties)
- **Cohorts**: Groups of users defined by shared characteristics or behaviors
- **Segments**: Dynamic filters applied to data analysis
- **Funnels**: Sequential steps in user journeys with conversion tracking
- **Retention**: Measurement of user return behavior over time periods

### Experimentation Terminology
- **Feature Flags**: Boolean toggles controlling feature availability
- **Variants**: Different versions of features being tested
- **Allocation**: Percentage of users exposed to experiments
- **Mutual Exclusion**: Preventing users from participating in conflicting experiments
- **Sequential Testing**: Statistical method allowing continuous monitoring without multiple testing penalties
- **Holdout Groups**: Control populations excluded from all experiments

### Data Management
- **Tracking Plan**: Schema definition for events and properties via Amplitude Data
- **Ampli**: Code generation tool creating type-safe analytics implementations
- **Warehouse-native**: Architecture allowing analysis of data stored in customer data warehouses
- **Real-time Streaming**: Immediate data processing and availability
- **Batch Processing**: Scheduled bulk data processing

### Technical Infrastructure
- **SDKs**: Software Development Kits for various platforms and languages
- **APIs**: RESTful interfaces for programmatic access
- **Plugins**: Extensible architecture for SDK customization
- **Server Zones**: Geographic data processing regions (US, EU)

## Product Ecosystem Integration

### Multi-Product Workflows
The platform enables sophisticated cross-product workflows:

**Analytics to Experiment**: Users can create experiments directly from analytics insights, using behavioral segments as targeting criteria.

**Experiment to Analytics**: Experiment results automatically flow into analytics charts for comprehensive impact analysis beyond primary metrics.

**CDP to Analytics/Experiment**: Audience segments created in the CDP can be used for both analytics filtering and experiment targeting.

**Session Replay Integration**: Session recordings can be filtered by experiment variants or analytics segments to understand qualitative user behavior.

### Data Flow Architecture
The platform operates on a unified data model where:

**Event Stream**: All user interactions flow through a central event pipeline accessible to all products.

**User Profiles**: Unified user identity resolution across all touchpoints and products.

**Real-time Processing**: Events are processed in real-time for immediate availability in analytics, experiment assignment, and audience updates.

**Cross-Product Attribution**: Actions in one product (like survey responses) automatically become available as properties in analytics and experiment analysis.

### Developer Ecosystem
**SDK Catalog**: Comprehensive SDKs for Analytics including Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal platforms.

**Experiment SDKs**: Specialized SDKs for feature flag evaluation and experiment participation.

**Ampli Integration**: Type-safe code generation available across all SDK platforms.

**API Coverage**: Complete REST APIs for Analytics, Experiment, Guides and Surveys, and CDP operations.
