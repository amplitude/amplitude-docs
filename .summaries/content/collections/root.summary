Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with behavioral analytics, feature experimentation, session replay, and customer data platform capabilities. The platform enables teams to track user behavior, conduct A/B tests, analyze user sessions, and manage data integrations across web and mobile applications.

## Product Architecture and Core Components

The Amplitude ecosystem consists of four primary product areas that work together to provide end-to-end user analytics:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the core behavioral analytics engine, featuring multiple chart types for data visualization including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Compass, Personas, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, Revenue LTV, Data Tables, and Experiment Results. The analytics platform processes events through the HTTP V2 API and supports both real-time and batch data processing.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities through remote and local evaluation models. The platform supports sophisticated user segmentation through cohort targeting and operates across multiple programming languages via comprehensive SDK coverage.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and reconstructs user interactions across web, mobile (iOS/Android), and React Native applications, providing visual insights through session recordings and heatmaps with comprehensive privacy controls.

**Amplitude CDP (Customer Data Platform)** manages data ingestion and distribution through source and destination catalogs, warehouse-native capabilities, and audience management tools.

## SDK Portfolio and Technical Implementation

The platform provides extensive SDK coverage across multiple programming languages and platforms:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser SDK 2.0 (`@amplitude/analytics-browser@2+`), Android SDK, iOS SDK, React Native SDK, Node.js SDK, Python SDK, Java SDK, Go SDK, Flutter SDK, Unity SDK, and Unreal SDK. Each SDK supports core tracking methods including `track()`, `identify()`, `flush()`, and `init()`.

**Experiment SDKs** support both server-side and client-side implementations with evaluation methods including `fetch()`, `fetchV2()`, `evaluate()`, `evaluateV2()`, and `variant()`. The platform operates on two evaluation models: Remote Evaluation for real-time API calls and Local Evaluation for client-side processing with flag streaming capabilities.

**Ampli Code Generation** provides strongly-typed API wrappers generated from Amplitude Data tracking plans using the Amplitude CLI (`@amplitude/ampli`) with commands like `ampli pull` and `ampli status`.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Core Analytics Concepts:**
- **Device ID** - Unique identifier for user devices, managed via cookies with `AMP_` prefix
- **User ID** - Custom identifier for authenticated users
- **Session ID** - Identifier for user sessions with configurable timeout
- **Event Properties** - Custom data attached to tracked events
- **User Properties** - Persistent attributes associated with users via `Identify` interface

**Experimentation Terminology:**
- **Deployment Keys** - Authentication tokens for SDK instances determining flag access scope
- **Flag Keys** - Unique identifiers for specific feature flags
- **Variants** - Flag states or values returned during evaluation
- **ExperimentUser** - Objects encapsulating user identification and targeting properties
- **Cohort Targeting** - User segmentation through CohortSyncConfig with maxCohortSize parameters

**Data Management Concepts:**
- **Source Catalog** - 60+ data integration connectors for ingesting external data
- **Destination Catalog** - Output integrations for data activation
- **Audiences** - Behavioral user segments created in Amplitude
- **Warehouse-native** - Direct data warehouse integration capabilities

**Session Replay Definitions:**
- **Sample Rate** - Percentage of sessions to record (0.0 to 1.0)
- **Masking Levels** - Conservative, Light, and Medium privacy protection settings
- **Session Replay ID** - Event property `[Amplitude] Session Replay ID` attached to analytics events

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates with modern data stack architectures where cloud data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks) serve as the single source of truth. The platform supports:

**Data Residency and Compliance:**
- **ServerZone** configuration with ServerZone.US and ServerZone.EU options
- GDPR compliance tools including DSAR API integration and User Privacy API
- Regional compliance endpoints for EU data residency

**Third-Party Integrations:**
- Analytics platforms: Segment, Rudderstack, Google Tag Manager
- Attribution platforms: AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch, Singular
- Marketing tools: HubSpot, Braze, Iterable, MoEngage
- Experimentation platforms: Split, Optimizely, Taplytics

**Authentication and Security:**
- OAuth authentication flows for platforms like HubSpot and Intercom
- Service account configurations for enterprise-grade authentication
- JWT tokens and service account credentials for warehouse integrations

## API Endpoints and Technical Specifications

**Core API Endpoints:**
- **Analytics HTTP V2 API** - Primary event ingestion endpoint
- **Amplitude Attribution API** - Specialized mobile attribution data ingestion with 72-hour retention windows
- **Experiment Evaluation API** - Remote flag evaluation with deployment key authentication
- **Session Replay Ingestion API** - Session recording data upload with compression support

**Configuration Patterns:**
- **Initialization Methods**: `initializeRemote()`, `initializeLocal()`, `ExperimentClient.initialize()`
- **Event Tracking**: `amplitude.track(eventType, eventProperties)`, `amplitude.identify(identifyObject)`
- **Experiment Evaluation**: `fetch()`, `evaluate()`, `variant.value`
- **Session Management**: `start()`, `stop()`, `getSessionReplayProperties()`

**Advanced Features:**
- **Autocapture** - Automatic tracking of page views, sessions, form interactions, and file downloads
- **Marketing Attribution** - UTM parameter, referrer, and click ID tracking
- **Flag Streaming** - Real-time configuration updates via StreamUpdates
- **Cohort Synchronization** - Hourly sync cycles with 24-hour deduplication windows
- **Cross-domain Tracking** - Device ID persistence across domains

The platform operates through standardized route patterns including `/analytics/{slug}`, `/sdks/{platform}/{slug}`, `/apis/{product}/{slug}`, and `/feature-experiment/{slug}`, with comprehensive documentation supporting both English and Japanese localization through dedicated content collections.
