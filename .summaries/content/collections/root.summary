Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and make data-driven decisions. The platform consists of several interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP), all supported by extensive SDK libraries and API integrations.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem is built around a core analytics engine that processes user events and behaviors, with specialized modules extending functionality into specific use cases:

**Analytics Core**: The foundational product providing event tracking, user segmentation, and behavioral analysis through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, and Revenue LTV charts.

**Amplitude Experiment**: A feature flagging and A/B testing platform that enables controlled rollouts and statistical analysis of product changes. It includes advanced techniques, experiment theory, workflow management, troubleshooting tools, and comprehensive results analysis with sequential testing methodologies.

**Session Replay**: A user experience analysis tool that captures and replays user sessions to identify friction points and optimization opportunities.

**Guides and Surveys**: An in-product messaging and feedback collection system for user onboarding, feature adoption, and customer insights.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)**: A unified data layer that manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation across the customer journey, including audience management, source and destination catalogs, and warehouse-native capabilities.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events**: Discrete user actions tracked within applications, forming the foundation of all analytics and experimentation analysis.

**Properties**: Attributes associated with events or users that provide context and enable segmentation and filtering.

**Cohorts/Audiences**: Groups of users defined by shared characteristics or behaviors, used for targeted analysis and activation.

**Funnels**: Multi-step conversion paths that measure user progression through defined sequences of actions.

**Retention**: Analysis of user return behavior over specified time periods, measuring product stickiness and engagement.

**Segments**: Filtered subsets of users or events based on specific criteria, enabling comparative analysis.

**Amplitude IDs**: Unique user identifiers that enable cross-platform and cross-session user tracking.

**Exposure Events**: In experimentation, events that indicate when users are assigned to specific experiment variants.

**Feature Flags**: Configuration switches that control feature availability and experiment variant assignment.

**Ampli**: A type-safe analytics wrapper that provides strongly-typed event tracking and validation.

**Sequential Testing**: Statistical methodology for continuous experiment monitoring with controlled error rates.

## SDK and Integration Ecosystem

Amplitude provides comprehensive instrumentation through platform-specific SDKs:

**Analytics SDKs**: Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine SDKs for event tracking and user identification.

**Experiment SDKs**: Specialized SDKs for feature flag evaluation and experiment variant assignment across multiple platforms.

**Ampli**: Code-generation tool that creates type-safe tracking libraries from centrally defined tracking plans.

## API Endpoints and Integration Points

The platform exposes several API categories:

**Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/`): Endpoints for event ingestion, user property updates, and data export.

**Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`): Feature flag configuration, variant assignment, and exposure tracking endpoints.

**Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`): In-product messaging and survey management endpoints.

The routing structure follows consistent patterns with product-specific namespaces (e.g., `/analytics/`, `/feature-experiment/`, `/data/`, `/sdks/`).

## Data Management and Activation

The CDP component manages data flow through:

**Sources**: Data ingestion points from various platforms and tools, cataloged in the source catalog with integration categories and taxonomies.

**Destinations**: Data activation endpoints for marketing tools, data warehouses, and other downstream systems, organized in the destination catalog.

**Warehouse-native Amplitude**: Direct integration with data warehouses for analysis without data movement.

**PII Management**: Specialized handling of personally identifiable information with dedicated integration patterns.

## Administrative and Operational Features

Platform management includes:

**Account Management**: User provisioning, permissions, and organizational structure.

**Single Sign-on**: Enterprise authentication integration.

**Billing and Usage**: Cost management and usage monitoring.

**Migration Tools**: Platform transition and data migration utilities.

The platform supports multi-site deployment with internationalization capabilities, including Japanese language support, and provides comprehensive FAQ, troubleshooting resources, and partner ecosystem integration.

## Chart Types and Analysis Capabilities

Amplitude's analytics engine supports diverse analysis patterns through specialized chart types, each optimized for specific analytical questions about user behavior, conversion optimization, and business performance measurement. The platform enables both real-time and historical analysis with flexible segmentation and comparative capabilities across the entire user journey.
