Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides product teams with tools for user behavior analysis, feature experimentation, data management, and in-product user engagement. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products that enable data-driven product development through advanced analytics, A/B testing, customer data management, and personalized user experiences.

## Core Product Architecture and Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem is built around four primary product pillars that work synergistically:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, providing behavioral event tracking, user segmentation, and advanced charting capabilities. It integrates with multiple SDKs (Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, Unreal) and supports comprehensive event instrumentation through the Ampli code generation tool.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced statistical analysis, multi-armed bandit optimization, and sophisticated targeting mechanisms. It includes dedicated experiment SDKs and integrates deeply with the analytics platform for comprehensive experiment analysis.

**Amplitude CDP (Customer Data Platform)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation through source and destination catalogs, audience management, and warehouse-native capabilities. It provides the data infrastructure that powers personalization and segmentation across all other products.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user session recordings to provide qualitative insights that complement quantitative analytics data, enabling deeper understanding of user behavior patterns and friction points.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user engagement through contextual guidance, feedback collection, and personalized onboarding experiences, leveraging the targeting and segmentation capabilities of the broader platform.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Event Segmentation** - Core analytics methodology for analyzing user actions and behaviors across different user segments and time periods

**Funnel Analysis** - Sequential step analysis that tracks user progression through defined conversion paths with drop-off identification

**Retention Analysis** - Cohort-based analysis measuring user return behavior over specified time periods with N-day and unbounded retention calculations

**Lifecycle Charts** - User state transition analysis categorizing users as New, Current, Resurrected, or Dormant based on activity patterns

**Personas** - Behavioral user clustering that automatically identifies distinct user groups based on event patterns and properties

**Compass** - Automated insights engine that surfaces significant trends, anomalies, and opportunities within user behavior data

**Journeys** - Path analysis tool that visualizes common user navigation patterns and identifies optimization opportunities

**Stickiness** - Engagement measurement calculating the ratio of daily active users to monthly active users

**Impact Analysis** - Statistical analysis tool for measuring the causal effect of product changes on key metrics

**Revenue LTV** - Customer lifetime value analysis with predictive modeling for revenue optimization

**Ampli** - Type-safe analytics SDK generator that creates strongly-typed tracking libraries from Amplitude's tracking plan

**Feature Flags** - Dynamic configuration system enabling real-time feature toggling and gradual rollouts

**Variants** - Experiment configuration options that define different user experiences within A/B tests

**Allocation** - User assignment mechanism that determines experiment participation and variant distribution

**Holdout Groups** - Control populations excluded from experiments to measure overall program impact

**Multi-Armed Bandit** - Adaptive experimentation algorithm that automatically optimizes traffic allocation based on performance

**Warehouse-Native** - Architecture pattern enabling analytics directly on customer data warehouses without data movement

**Source Catalog** - Pre-built integrations for data ingestion from various platforms and services

**Destination Catalog** - Pre-built integrations for data activation and syndication to downstream tools

**Audiences** - Dynamic user segments that automatically update based on behavioral criteria and can be synced to external platforms

## Advanced Analytics and Chart Types

Amplitude provides specialized chart types optimized for different analytical use cases:

**Event Segmentation** enables flexible event analysis with property breakdowns, formula calculations, and comparative analysis across segments. It supports custom date ranges, sampling controls, and advanced filtering mechanisms.

**Funnel Analysis** tracks conversion optimization through sequential step analysis with time window controls, holding constant properties, and conversion criteria customization. It includes funnel microscope for detailed user journey analysis.

**Retention Analysis** measures user engagement persistence through cohort analysis with customizable return criteria, retention types (N-day, unbounded, bracket), and comparative cohort analysis.

**User Sessions** analyzes session-based metrics including session duration, events per session, and session-based conversion analysis with custom session definition controls.

**Lifecycle** categorizes user states and transitions with customizable activity definitions and time window configurations for user state management.

**Stickiness** measures engagement intensity through DAU/MAU ratios and frequency distribution analysis with customizable activity definitions.

**Personas** automatically discovers behavioral user segments through machine learning clustering with customizable feature selection and segment validation.

**Journeys** visualizes user path analysis with customizable path length, event filtering, and conversion goal tracking.

**Impact Analysis** provides causal inference analysis for measuring feature impact with statistical significance testing and confidence intervals.

**Revenue LTV** calculates customer lifetime value with predictive modeling, cohort-based analysis, and revenue attribution.

## SDK Architecture and Implementation

Amplitude's SDK ecosystem provides comprehensive instrumentation capabilities across platforms:

**Analytics SDKs** support event tracking, user identification, property management, and offline data handling. They include automatic event tracking, session management, and data validation capabilities. Platform-specific SDKs (Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal, Node.js, Python, Java, Go) provide native integration patterns and performance optimization.

**Experiment SDKs** handle feature flag evaluation, variant assignment, and exposure tracking with local evaluation capabilities, fallback mechanisms, and real-time flag updates. They support both client-side and server-side evaluation patterns.

**Ampli** generates type-safe tracking libraries from Amplitude's tracking plan, providing compile-time validation, auto-completion, and documentation generation. It supports multiple programming languages and integrates with development workflows.

## API Ecosystem and Integration Patterns

**Analytics API** provides programmatic access to event ingestion, user management, and data export with batch processing capabilities, real-time streaming, and comprehensive error handling.

**Experiment APIs** enable flag management, experiment configuration, and results analysis with REST and GraphQL interfaces supporting automated experiment lifecycle management.

**Guides and Surveys API** allows programmatic control of in-product experiences with targeting configuration, content management, and analytics integration.

The API ecosystem supports webhook integrations, real-time data streaming, and comprehensive authentication mechanisms including API keys, OAuth, and SSO integration.

## Enterprise Administration and Data Governance

**Account Management** provides organizational structure with project hierarchies, team management, and permission controls. It supports enterprise SSO integration, audit logging, and compliance reporting.

**Single Sign-On** integration supports SAML, OIDC, and custom authentication providers with automated user provisioning and role mapping.

**Billing and Usage** management includes consumption monitoring, quota management, and cost optimization tools with detailed usage analytics and forecasting.

**Data Governance** features include data retention policies, privacy controls, PII management, and regulatory compliance tools supporting GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations.
