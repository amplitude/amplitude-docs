- Experimentation and A/B testing capabilities
- User segmentation and audience management
- Cross-platform SDK support for data collection
- Integration with data warehouses and third-party tools

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Amplitude ecosystem consists of several interconnected products:

1. **Analytics** - The core platform for analyzing user behavior data
   - Charts (Funnel Analysis, Retention, User Sessions, etc.)
   - Data Tables
   - Engagement Matrix
   - Session Replay

2. **Experiment** - A/B testing and feature experimentation platform
   - Experiment Theory
   - Advanced Techniques
   - Web Experiment
   - Workflow
   - Under-the-Hood

3. **Data Management**
   - Sources (data collection)
   - Audiences (user segmentation)
   - CDP (Customer Data Platform)
   - PII Integrations

4. **SDKs** - Client and server libraries for data collection
   - Browser SDK
   - Mobile SDKs (iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter)
   - Server SDKs (Node.js, Python, Java, Go)
   - Gaming SDKs (Unity, Unreal)
   - Ampli (type-safe wrapper)

5. **APIs**
   - Analytics API
   - Experiment APIs

6. **Admin and Account Management**
   - Billing and Usage
   - Single Sign-On
   - Account Management

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: A user action or occurrence tracked in Amplitude (e.g., button click, page view)
- **User Properties**: Attributes associated with a user (e.g., name, email, plan type)
- **Session**: A period of continuous user engagement with an application
- **Funnel**: A series of events representing a user journey or conversion path
- **Retention**: Measurement of how many users return to an application over time
- **Cohort**: A group of users who share common characteristics or behaviors
- **Experiment**: A controlled test comparing different variations of a feature
- **Source**: An origin point for data collection (e.g., website, mobile app)
- **Destination**: A system where Amplitude can send processed data
- **Ampli**: A code generation tool that creates type-safe wrappers for tracking plans

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's products are designed to work together in a cohesive ecosystem:

1. **Data Collection Flow**:
   - SDKs collect data from various platforms (web, mobile, server)
   - Data is sent to Amplitude's servers via HTTP APIs
   - The Ampli wrapper ensures data quality through type-safe tracking

2. **Analysis and Visualization**:
   - Collected data is processed and made available in Analytics
   - Various chart types provide different perspectives on user behavior
   - Compass provides guided analysis of key metrics

3. **Experimentation Workflow**:
   - Experiment platform uses collected data to measure test results
   - Experiment SDKs handle feature flag delivery and experiment assignment
   - Impact Analysis measures the effect of experiments on key metrics

4. **Data Management and Integration**:
   - Source Catalog manages incoming data connections
   - Destination Catalog handles outgoing data connections
   - CDP enables real-time audience syncing to marketing tools

## API Endpoints and SDK Implementation

### Analytics API

The Analytics API allows programmatic access to Amplitude data:

```
GET /api/2/events/segmentation
GET /api/2/events/funnel
GET /api/2/events/retention
```

### SDK Implementation Examples

**Browser SDK Initialization**:
```javascript
amplitude.init('API_KEY', {
  serverUrl: 'https://api.amplitude.com',
  logLevel: 3
});
```

**Android SDK Event Tracking**:
```kotlin
amplitude.track("Button Clicked", 
  mapOf("button_name" to "sign_up", "page" to "landing")
)
```

**Ampli Wrapper Usage**:
```javascript
ampli.load({
  client: {
    apiKey: "API_KEY"
  }
});
ampli.signUpCompleted({
  userId: "user-123",
  plan: "premium"
});
```

## Collection Structure and Organization

The documentation is organized into collections that reflect the product structure:

1. **Product-specific collections** (analytics, experiment, data, etc.)
2. **SDK-specific collections** (browser_sdk, ios_sdk, android_sdk, etc.)
3. **Feature-specific collections** (funnel-analysis, retention-analysis, etc.)
4. **Administrative collections** (account-management, billing-use, etc.)
5. **Support collections** (faq_and_troubleshooting, migration)

Each collection typically follows a consistent pattern with:
- English-only or multi-language support (some with Japanese translations)
- Date-based visibility control (past content public, future content private)
- Custom routing patterns reflecting the product hierarchy
- Preview targets for content editors
- Specific navigation structure and organization

The collections are interconnected through a hierarchical structure that mirrors the product relationships, allowing users to navigate logically through the documentation based on their needs.
