# Amplitude Product Ecosystem Documentation

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics platform that helps businesses understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth. The platform consists of several interconnected products and features that collectively enable data collection, analysis, experimentation, and data management. Key components include Analytics (with various chart types and visualization tools), Experiment (for A/B testing), Data management tools, and SDKs for various platforms.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Amplitude ecosystem is organized into several major product areas:

1. **Analytics** - The core analysis platform with multiple visualization tools:
   - Charts (Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Stickiness, etc.)
   - Compass (for product insights)
   - Session Replay (for visual user journey analysis)

2. **Data Management** - Tools for collecting, organizing and managing data:
   - Sources (data ingestion)
   - Audiences (user segmentation)
   - CDP (Customer Data Platform)
   - PII Integrations (for handling sensitive data)
   - Destination/Source Catalogs (for data connections)

3. **Experimentation** - Tools for testing and optimization:
   - Experiment (A/B testing platform)
   - Web Experiment (web-specific experimentation)
   - Experiment APIs and SDKs
   - Impact Analysis (for measuring experiment results)

4. **SDKs and APIs** - Implementation tools for various platforms:
   - Platform-specific SDKs (Browser, iOS, Android, Flutter, React Native, Unity, Unreal, Node.js, Python, Java, Go)
   - Ampli SDK (wrapper SDK with type safety)
   - Analytics APIs

5. **Administration** - Tools for account and system management:
   - Account Management
   - Billing and Usage
   - Single Sign-On

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Events**: User actions tracked within a product (clicks, page views, transactions)
- **Properties**: Additional context about events (user type, device info, etc.)
- **User Sessions**: Grouped sequences of user actions within a time period
- **Funnels**: Sequential steps users take toward a conversion goal
- **Retention**: Measurement of users returning to a product over time
- **Journeys/Pathfinder**: Visualization of user navigation paths through a product
- **Experiment**: A/B tests to compare different product variations
- **Segments**: Subsets of users based on behaviors or attributes
- **Instrumentation**: The process of implementing tracking in applications
- **Warehouse-native**: Integration approach that connects directly to data warehouses

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude platform is designed as an integrated ecosystem where data flows between components:

1. **Data Collection Layer**: SDKs and APIs capture user behavior from various platforms and send it to Amplitude's data processing pipeline.

2. **Data Management Layer**: Sources, CDP, and catalog tools organize and prepare data for analysis.

3. **Analysis Layer**: Analytics tools (charts, dashboards) provide insights from the collected data.

4. **Action Layer**: Experiment and audience tools enable taking action based on insights.

The platform supports both real-time analytics and deeper historical analysis, with cross-product features like the ability to convert discovered paths in Journeys into Funnels for further analysis.

## API Endpoints and Implementation

Amplitude provides several implementation approaches:

1. **SDK Implementation**:
   - Browser SDK: `amplitude.getInstance().track('Event Name', {property: value})`
   - Mobile SDKs: Platform-specific tracking methods
   - Server-side SDKs: For backend event tracking

2. **Ampli SDK**: A code-generated wrapper that provides type safety and validation
   - Example: `ampli.track("Event Name", {property: value})`

3. **HTTP API Endpoints**:
   - Event ingestion: `https://api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`
   - User profile updates: `https://api.amplitude.com/usermap`
   - Export API: `https://amplitude.com/api/2/export`

4. **Experiment Implementation**:
   - Fetch variants: `experiment.variant('experiment-key', 'default-value')`
   - Track exposure: `experiment.exposure('experiment-key')`

The documentation is organized to support different user personas, from developers implementing tracking to analysts interpreting data, with specialized sections for advanced techniques and troubleshooting.
