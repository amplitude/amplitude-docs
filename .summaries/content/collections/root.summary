# Amplitude Product Ecosystem

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics platform that helps businesses understand user behavior, optimize experiences, and drive growth. The platform consists of several interconnected products and features:

1. **Analytics** - Core analytics platform for tracking, visualizing, and analyzing user behavior
2. **Data** - Data management capabilities including source/destination integrations and PII handling
3. **Experiment** - A/B testing and feature experimentation platform
4. **SDKs** - Client and server libraries for instrumenting applications across platforms
5. **APIs** - Programmatic interfaces for data access and management
6. **Admin** - Account management, billing, and single sign-on functionality

The platform supports multiple visualization methods through various chart types, offers data collection through numerous SDKs, and provides integration capabilities with external systems through source and destination catalogs.

## Product Relationships and Features

### Core Products

- **Analytics**: The central product for visualizing and analyzing user behavior data through charts, funnels, retention analysis, and other visualization methods.
- **Data**: Manages data collection, integration, and governance with source/destination catalogs and PII management.
- **Experiment**: Enables A/B testing and feature experimentation with dedicated SDKs and APIs.
- **Admin**: Handles account management, billing, and organizational settings.

### Analytics Visualization Tools

- **Charts**: Various visualization types including event segmentation, funnel analysis, retention analysis, user sessions, journeys, lifecycle, stickiness, revenue/LTV, impact analysis, personas, engagement matrix, and experiment results.
- **Compass**: Analytics tool for exploring user behavior patterns.
- **Legacy Charts**: Previous generation visualization tools maintained for backward compatibility.

### SDK Ecosystem

- **Platform-specific SDKs**: Android, iOS, Browser, Flutter, Go, Java, Node.js, Python, React Native, Unity, and Unreal.
- **Ampli**: Code-generated wrapper providing type-safe analytics based on tracking plans.
- **Experiment SDKs**: Dedicated SDKs for implementing experiments and feature flags.
- **Session Replay**: Capabilities for recording and analyzing user sessions.

### Integration Capabilities

- **Source Catalog**: Integrations for importing data from external sources.
- **Destination Catalog**: Integrations for exporting data to external platforms.
- **Warehouse-Native Amplitude**: Direct integration with data warehouses without requiring API keys.

### Documentation Structure

- **Get Started**: Onboarding and basic setup guides.
- **Instrumentation**: Implementation guides for tracking and data collection.
- **Migration**: Resources for migrating between versions or from other platforms.
- **FAQ and Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: A discrete user action or occurrence tracked in the system.
- **User ID**: Custom identifier set by the application to identify a specific user.
- **Device ID**: Unique identifier for a device, persisted across app installations.
- **Session**: Period of continuous user engagement with an application.
- **Identify**: Operations that update user properties without sending events.
- **Group**: Collection of users that can be analyzed together.
- **Tracking Plan**: Schema defining expected events and their properties.
- **Ampli Wrapper**: Code-generated SDK wrapper providing type-safe analytics.
- **Chart**: Visualization of analytics data in various formats.
- **Funnel**: Analysis of user progression through a sequence of events.
- **Retention**: Analysis of user return behavior over time.
- **Cohort**: Group of users who share common characteristics or behaviors.
- **Experiment**: A/B test or feature flag implementation.
- **Integration Category**: Classification for source and destination integrations.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude platform is designed as an integrated ecosystem where data flows between products:

1. **Data Collection**: SDKs and APIs collect data from applications and services.
2. **Data Processing**: The Analytics platform processes and stores this data.
3. **Data Analysis**: Charts and visualization tools help analyze the data.
4. **Data Action**: Experiment allows acting on insights through A/B tests.
5. **Data Distribution**: Destination integrations send data to external systems.

The platform supports cross-product workflows such as:
- Creating cohorts in Analytics and targeting them in Experiment
- Using tracking plans from Data to generate type-safe Ampli wrappers
- Analyzing experiment results in Analytics charts
- Exporting insights through the destination catalog

## API Endpoints and Commands

### Analytics API

The Analytics API allows programmatic access to Amplitude data with endpoints for:
- Sending events
- Querying user data
- Retrieving analytics results
- Managing cohorts

### Experiment APIs

Dedicated APIs for managing experiments and feature flags:
- Creating and updating experiments
- Managing feature flags
- Retrieving experiment results

### CLI Tools

- **Ampli CLI**: Command-line tool for working with tracking plans and generating SDK wrappers
  ```bash
  ampli pull  # Pull tracking plan updates
  ampli status  # Check implementation status
  ```

### SDK Initialization Patterns

Most SDKs follow similar initialization patterns:
```javascript
// Browser SDK example
amplitude.init('API_KEY', {
  optionalConfigObject: value
});
```

```kotlin
// Android-Kotlin SDK example
val amplitude = Amplitude(Configuration(
    apiKey = "YOUR-API-KEY",
    context = applicationContext
))
```

The documentation is organized to support different user journeys through the product ecosystem, with specialized collections for each product area and cross-cutting concerns like migration, troubleshooting, and getting started.
