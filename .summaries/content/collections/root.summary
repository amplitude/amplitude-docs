## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Analytics Terms
- **Event**: A user action tracked in Amplitude.
- **User Property**: Attributes associated with users.
- **Cohort**: A group of users who share common characteristics.
- **Funnel**: A series of steps users take toward a conversion goal.
- **Retention**: Measurement of how many users return to a product over time.
- **Session**: A period of continuous user activity.
- **LTV (Lifetime Value)**: The predicted revenue a user will generate.

### Experimentation Terms
- **Experiment**: A controlled test to evaluate changes.
- **Variant**: A version of a product being tested.
- **Control Group**: Users who see the unchanged product.
- **Treatment Group**: Users who see the experimental version.
- **Statistical Significance**: Confidence that results aren't due to chance.

### Data Management Terms
- **Source**: Origin of data flowing into Amplitude.
- **Destination**: Platform receiving data from Amplitude.
- **Integration**: Connection between Amplitude and another system.
- **Taxonomy**: Standardized naming conventions for events and properties.

## Technical Implementation

### SDK Implementation
Most Amplitude SDKs follow a similar implementation pattern:

```javascript
// Browser SDK example
import * as amplitude from '@amplitude/analytics-browser';

amplitude.init('YOUR_API_KEY');
amplitude.track('Event Name', {
  eventProperty1: 'value1',
  eventProperty2: 'value2'
});
```

### API Endpoints
Amplitude provides RESTful APIs for various functions:

- **HTTP API**: `https://api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi` for sending events
- **Export API**: `https://amplitude.com/api/2/export` for retrieving data
- **Dashboard API**: `https://amplitude.com/api/3/chart/{chart_id}` for accessing charts

### Command Line Invocations
The Ampli CLI tool can be used for SDK generation:

```bash
npx @amplitude/ampli pull
npx @amplitude/ampli status
npx @amplitude/ampli generate
```

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's products are designed to work together in a cohesive ecosystem:

1. **Data Collection**: Events are tracked via SDKs or integrations with data sources.
2. **Data Processing**: Raw data is processed and stored in Amplitude's data platform.
3. **Analysis**: Users analyze data through charts and visualizations.
4. **Segmentation**: Audiences are created based on user behavior.
5. **Experimentation**: Experiments are run on specific audiences.
6. **Activation**: Insights drive actions through integrations with destinations.

The platform supports a complete analytics lifecycle from data collection to insight-driven action, with each product component designed to integrate seamlessly with others. For example, experiment results can be analyzed using the same charts and visualizations as regular analytics data, and audiences created in the analytics platform can be used for targeting experiments or guides.

This integrated approach allows organizations to build a comprehensive understanding of user behavior, test hypotheses, and optimize experiences across their digital products.
