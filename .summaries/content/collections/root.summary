# Amplitude Product Ecosystem Overview

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics platform that helps businesses understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth. The platform consists of several interconnected products and features that collectively enable data collection, analysis, experimentation, and activation.

Key features of the Amplitude ecosystem include:
- Analytics capabilities for tracking user behavior and product performance
- Experimentation tools for testing hypotheses and optimizing experiences
- Data management solutions for collecting, organizing, and activating user data
- SDKs for various platforms to instrument and collect behavioral data
- Integration capabilities with third-party tools and services
- Visualization and reporting tools for insights discovery

## Product Relationships and Features

The Amplitude ecosystem consists of several interconnected products:

1. **Analytics** - The core analytics platform for understanding user behavior through charts, funnels, retention analysis, and other visualization tools.

2. **Experiment** - A feature experimentation platform that allows testing hypotheses and measuring impact on key metrics.

3. **CDP (Customer Data Platform)** - A data management solution for collecting, organizing, and activating user data.

4. **Data** - The foundation for managing data sources, audiences, and data governance.

5. **SDKs** - Client and server libraries for various platforms (Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, etc.) that enable instrumentation and data collection.

6. **Ampli** - A code generation tool that creates type-safe wrappers around Amplitude SDKs.

7. **APIs** - RESTful interfaces for programmatic interaction with Amplitude services.

8. **Source/Destination Catalog** - Integration hub connecting Amplitude with third-party tools and services.

9. **Session Replay** - Visual recording of user sessions for qualitative analysis.

10. **Admin** - Account management, billing, and single sign-on capabilities.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Event** - A discrete user action or system occurrence tracked in Amplitude
2. **User Properties** - Attributes associated with individual users
3. **Event Properties** - Metadata associated with specific events
4. **Cohort** - A defined segment of users who share common characteristics or behaviors
5. **Funnel Analysis** - Tracking user progression through a sequence of events
6. **Retention Analysis** - Measuring how users continue to engage over time
7. **Journeys** - Visualization of user paths through a product
8. **Impact Analysis** - Measuring the effect of product changes on key metrics
9. **Experiment** - A controlled test comparing variations of a feature
10. **Instrumentation** - The process of implementing tracking code in applications
11. **Source** - An origin point for data flowing into Amplitude
12. **Destination** - A target for data or cohorts flowing out of Amplitude
13. **Taxonomy** - The organizational structure of events and properties
14. **Tracking Plan** - A specification for what events and properties to track

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's products are designed to work together in a cohesive ecosystem:

1. **Data Collection Layer** - SDKs (Browser, iOS, Android, etc.) and the Source Catalog enable data collection from various platforms and third-party tools.

2. **Data Management Layer** - CDP and Data products organize, govern, and prepare data for analysis.

3. **Analysis Layer** - Analytics provides visualization and insight discovery through charts, funnels, retention analysis, etc.

4. **Activation Layer** - Experiment and the Destination Catalog enable acting on insights through experimentation and integration with marketing tools.

5. **Administration Layer** - Account Management, Billing, and Single Sign-On provide organizational control and access management.

The platform supports a complete analytics lifecycle:
- Collect data through SDKs and integrations
- Organize and manage data in the CDP
- Analyze behavior with Analytics tools
- Test hypotheses with Experiment
- Activate insights through integrations and cohort exports

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

Amplitude provides several API endpoints for programmatic interaction:

1. **HTTP API V2** - For sending events to Amplitude
   - Endpoint: `https://api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`

2. **Identify API** - For updating user properties
   - Endpoint: `https://api2.amplitude.com/identify`

3. **Experiment API** - For fetching experiment variants and reporting results
   - Endpoints include variant assignment and exposure tracking

4. **Chart Annotations API** - For programmatically creating annotations
   - Endpoint: `https://analytics.amplitude.com/api/2/annotations`

5. **Cohort API** - For managing and exporting user cohorts
   - Endpoint: `https://amplitude.com/api/2/cohorts`

6. **Export API** - For exporting raw event data
   - Endpoint: `https://amplitude.com/api/2/export`

SDK implementation typically follows this pattern:
```javascript
// Browser SDK example
amplitude.init('API_KEY');
amplitude.track('Event Name', {
  eventProperty1: 'value1',
  eventProperty2: 'value2'
});
```

The Ampli SDK provides type-safe wrappers:
```typescript
// Ampli SDK example
ampli.load();
ampli.trackEventName({
  eventProperty1: 'value1',
  eventProperty2: 'value2'
});
```

The platform architecture supports both client-side and server-side tracking, with options for real-time event streaming and batch processing depending on implementation needs.
