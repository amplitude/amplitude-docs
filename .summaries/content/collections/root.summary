Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides product teams with tools for user behavior analysis, feature experimentation, data management, and in-product user engagement. The platform consists of several interconnected products that work together to enable data-driven product development and user experience optimization.

## Core Product Architecture

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, providing behavioral analytics capabilities through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Revenue LTV, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, and Experiment Results. Each chart type offers specialized analysis capabilities for different aspects of user behavior and product performance.

**Amplitude Experiment** is the feature flagging and experimentation platform that enables A/B testing, multivariate testing, and feature rollouts. It includes advanced techniques, experiment theory, workflow management, troubleshooting capabilities, and "under the hood" technical implementation details. The platform supports both client-side and server-side experimentation with comprehensive statistical analysis.

**Amplitude Session Replay** provides session recording and playback capabilities, allowing teams to observe actual user interactions and identify usability issues through visual session analysis.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** delivers in-product user experience tools for contextual guidance, feedback collection, and user onboarding through interactive guides, surveys, and resource centers.

## Data Management and Integration Ecosystem

The **Customer Data Platform (CDP)** functionality includes comprehensive data management through Sources (data ingestion), Destinations (data activation), Audiences (user segmentation), and Warehouse-native capabilities. The platform supports extensive integration through Source Catalog and Destination Catalog with taxonomized integration categories, enabling seamless data flow between Amplitude and external systems.

**PII Integrations** provide specialized handling of personally identifiable information with appropriate privacy and compliance controls.

## SDK and API Architecture

The platform provides extensive instrumentation capabilities through multiple SDKs:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser SDK (`/sdks/analytics/browser/`), Android SDK (`/sdks/analytics/android/`), iOS SDK (`/sdks/analytics/ios/`), React Native SDK (`/sdks/analytics/react-native/`), Flutter SDK (`/sdks/analytics/flutter/`), Node.js SDK (`/sdks/analytics/node/`), Python SDK (`/sdks/analytics-sdks/python/`), Java SDK (`/sdks/analytics/java/`), Go SDK (`/sdks/analytics/go/`), Unity SDK (`/sdks/analytics/unity/`), and Unreal SDK (`/sdks/analytics/unreal/`).

**Experiment SDKs** (`/sdks/experiment-sdks/`) provide feature flagging and experimentation capabilities across platforms.

**Ampli** (`/sdks/ampli/`) offers type-safe analytics implementation with code generation for consistent event tracking across development teams.

**API Infrastructure** includes Analytics API (`/apis/analytics/`), Experiment APIs (`/apis/experiment/`), and Guides and Surveys API (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) for programmatic access to platform functionality.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Events** represent user actions or system occurrences that are tracked and analyzed. **Properties** are attributes associated with events that provide additional context. **User Properties** describe characteristics of users, while **Event Properties** describe characteristics of specific events.

**Cohorts** are user segments based on shared characteristics or behaviors. **Funnels** track user progression through defined sequences of events. **Retention** measures user return behavior over time periods.

**Feature Flags** control feature availability and rollout, while **Experiments** test different variations of features or experiences. **Variants** represent different versions within experiments.

**Charts** are visualization and analysis tools, each with specific use cases and configuration options. **Dashboards** combine multiple charts for comprehensive analysis views.

**Amplitude Query Language (AQL)** provides advanced querying capabilities for complex analysis scenarios.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** (`/admin/account-management/`) provides organizational controls, user management, and access permissions. **Single Sign-on** (`/admin/single-sign-on/`) enables enterprise authentication integration. **Billing and Use** (`/admin/billing-use/`) offers usage monitoring and billing management.

The platform implements role-based access control with different permission levels (Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator) that control access to various features and data.

## Developer Experience and Implementation

**Get Started** documentation provides onboarding guidance, while **Migration** resources assist with platform transitions. **FAQ and Troubleshooting** sections offer comprehensive support for common implementation challenges.

**Academy Content** provides educational resources for platform mastery. **Partners** documentation covers third-party integrations and ecosystem relationships.

## Routing and URL Structure

The platform uses hierarchical URL routing:
- `/analytics/` for core analytics features
- `/feature-experiment/` for experimentation capabilities  
- `/data/` for CDP and data management
- `/sdks/` for instrumentation documentation
- `/apis/` for API references
- `/admin/` for administrative functions
- `/session-replay/` for session recording features
- `/guides-and-surveys/` for in-product engagement tools

## Multi-language and Localization

The platform supports internationalization with English (`en`) as the primary language and Japanese (`jp`) localization through dedicated translation collections and site-specific content propagation.

## Content Management and Documentation Structure

The platform uses a sophisticated content management system with collections organized by product area, feature type, and user journey stage. Each collection includes template configuration, layout specifications, routing rules, preview capabilities, and navigation injection for consistent user experience across the documentation ecosystem.

The platform represents a comprehensive solution for product analytics, experimentation, and user engagement, designed to support data-driven product development workflows from initial instrumentation through advanced analysis and optimization.
