Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools for data collection, analysis, feature experimentation, and user engagement. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products that work together to deliver insights across the entire user journey.

## Core Product Suite

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics platform, providing event tracking, user behavior analysis, and comprehensive reporting through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, Cohort Analysis, and User Journey mapping. The analytics engine supports real-time data processing and offers advanced segmentation capabilities.

**Amplitude Experiment** is the feature flagging and A/B testing platform that enables controlled feature rollouts and experimentation. It operates through remote and local evaluation modes, supporting both client-side and server-side implementations with sophisticated targeting capabilities including cohort-based segmentation.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and reconstructs user sessions to provide visual insights into user behavior and identify friction points in the user experience.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** facilitates in-app user engagement through targeted messaging, onboarding flows, and feedback collection mechanisms.

## Product Relationships and Data Flow

The platform operates on a unified data architecture where **Amplitude Analytics** serves as the central data hub. Event data collected through Analytics SDKs feeds into the **Customer Data Platform (CDP)**, which manages data routing to various destinations through the **Destination Catalog**. The **Source Catalog** enables data ingestion from external platforms and services.

**Amplitude Experiment** integrates deeply with Analytics, sharing user context and automatically tracking exposure events for experiment analysis. Experiment results are visualized through dedicated chart types within the Analytics platform, creating a seamless experimentation workflow.

**Audiences** created in Analytics can be used for targeting in both Experiment and Guides and Surveys, creating a cohesive user segmentation strategy across products. The **Warehouse-native Amplitude** capability allows organizations to run analytics directly on their data warehouse while maintaining integration with the broader Amplitude ecosystem.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** are discrete user actions tracked within applications, forming the foundation of all analytics. **Properties** are attributes associated with events or users that enable segmentation and analysis.

**Cohorts** are dynamic user segments based on behavioral criteria, while **Audiences** represent more sophisticated user groupings that can be synced to external platforms.

**Deployments** in Experiment represent environment-specific configurations containing feature flags, with **Flag Keys** serving as unique identifiers and **Variants** representing different experimental conditions.

**Charts** are analytical visualizations with specific purposes: **Event Segmentation** for trend analysis, **Funnels** for conversion tracking, **Retention** for user stickiness measurement, and **Journeys** for path analysis.

**Instrumentation** refers to the implementation of event tracking code, while **Ampli** provides a type-safe wrapper for analytics implementation with code generation capabilities.

## SDK Architecture and Implementation

The platform provides comprehensive SDK coverage across multiple languages and platforms:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser (JavaScript), iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal, Node.js, Python, Java, and Go implementations. Each SDK follows consistent patterns for event tracking, user identification, and configuration management.

**Experiment SDKs** are available in both client-side and server-side variants, supporting remote evaluation (real-time API calls) and local evaluation (cached configurations) modes. The **Evaluation Proxy** extends support to platforms without native SDKs through a Docker-deployed service.

All SDKs support **ServerZone** configuration for EU data residency compliance and provide integration hooks for third-party analytics platforms through standardized provider interfaces.

## API Ecosystem

The platform exposes comprehensive REST APIs:

- **Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/`) for event ingestion and data export
- **Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) for flag management and evaluation
- **Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) for campaign management

Common API patterns include batch event submission, real-time flag evaluation endpoints, and webhook configurations for data streaming.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** provides organization-level controls, while **Single Sign-on** enables enterprise authentication integration. **Billing and Use** tracking provides usage monitoring and cost management capabilities.

**PII Integrations** ensure compliance with privacy regulations through data handling controls and anonymization features.

## Chart Types and Analytics Capabilities

The platform offers specialized chart types for different analytical needs:

- **Event Segmentation** for trend and volume analysis
- **Funnel Analysis** for conversion optimization
- **Retention Analysis** for user stickiness measurement
- **User Sessions** for session-based analytics
- **Journeys** for user path analysis
- **Personas** for behavioral clustering
- **Revenue LTV** for monetization analysis
- **Compass** for metric correlation
- **Impact Analysis** for experiment result measurement

**Legacy Charts** maintain backward compatibility while **Other Charts** provide additional specialized visualizations.

The platform's architecture enables seamless data flow between products, creating a unified ecosystem where analytics insights inform experimentation strategies, which in turn generate data for further analysis, forming a continuous optimization cycle for product teams.
