# Amplitude Product Ecosystem

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that helps businesses understand user behavior, optimize experiences, and make data-driven decisions. The platform consists of several interconnected products:

1. **Analytics** - Core analytics platform for tracking and analyzing user behavior
2. **Experiment** - Feature flag and A/B testing platform
3. **CDP (Customer Data Platform)** - Data management and integration
4. **Data** - Data collection, management, and integration capabilities
5. **SDKs** - Client and server libraries for various platforms
6. **APIs** - Programmatic interfaces for data access and management

The platform supports various visualization tools including charts, funnels, retention analysis, and user journey mapping to help businesses understand user behavior and make data-driven decisions.

## Product Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem is designed as an integrated suite where products complement each other:

1. **Analytics Core** forms the foundation, with specialized visualization tools like charts, funnels, and journey analysis.

2. **Experiment** integrates with Analytics to provide feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities, with SDKs available for multiple platforms.

3. **Data Management** components include:
   - CDP for customer data orchestration
   - Source/Destination catalogs for data integration
   - PII management for privacy compliance
   - Audiences for user segmentation

4. **SDKs and APIs** provide implementation options across platforms:
   - Client SDKs: Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal
   - Server SDKs: Node.js, Python, Java, Go
   - Ampli SDK wrapper for type-safe instrumentation
   - Analytics and Experiment APIs

5. **Admin and Account Management** handles billing, SSO, and account configuration.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event** - A user action or system occurrence tracked in Amplitude
- **User** - An individual interacting with a product, identified by a unique ID
- **Session** - A period of continuous user engagement
- **Cohort** - A group of users who share common characteristics
- **Funnel** - A series of steps users take toward a conversion goal
- **Retention** - Measurement of users returning to a product over time
- **Feature Flag** - Toggle to enable/disable features or conduct experiments
- **Variant** - A specific version of a feature in an experiment
- **Source** - Origin point for data coming into Amplitude
- **Destination** - External system where Amplitude sends data
- **Instrumentation** - Process of implementing tracking code
- **Taxonomy** - Structured organization of events and properties

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude platform is designed as a cohesive ecosystem:

1. **Data Flow**:
   - Data is collected via SDKs or direct API calls
   - Processed through the CDP or data pipeline
   - Stored and made available for analysis
   - Visualized through various chart types
   - Activated through experiments or integrations

2. **Cross-Product Features**:
   - Unified user identity across products
   - Consistent data access across analytics and experimentation
   - Shared taxonomies and event definitions
   - Integrated reporting between experiments and analytics

3. **Integration Architecture**:
   - Source catalog connects external data sources
   - Destination catalog pushes data to external systems
   - APIs enable programmatic access to all platform capabilities
   - SDKs provide client and server implementation options

## API Endpoints and Implementation

### Analytics API
- Base URL: `/apis/analytics/`
- Key endpoints for querying analytics data and managing users

### Experiment API
- Base URL: `/apis/experiment/`
- Endpoints for managing feature flags and experiments

### SDK Implementation
- Client-side initialization:
  ```javascript
  amplitude.init('API_KEY', {options});
  ```

- Server-side initialization:
  ```
  AmplitudeClient client = Amplitude.getInstance().initialize(context, "API_KEY");
  ```

- Tracking events:
  ```javascript
  amplitude.track('Event Name', {eventProperties});
  ```

- Feature flag evaluation:
  ```javascript
  const variant = experiment.variant('flag-key', defaultValue);
  ```

### Command Line Examples
- Ampli CLI for code generation:
  ```
  ampli pull
  ampli status
  ```

The Amplitude platform provides a comprehensive suite of products for analytics, experimentation, and data management, with deep integration between components and extensive implementation options across platforms and languages.
