Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of several interconnected products that form a complete digital analytics ecosystem.

## Core Product Architecture

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, offering multiple chart types for behavioral analysis including Event Segmentation for user action analysis, Funnel Analysis for conversion optimization, Retention Analysis for user lifecycle understanding, User Sessions for engagement patterns, Cohort analysis through Lifecycle charts, Stickiness measurement, Revenue LTV tracking, Impact Analysis for feature assessment, and Personas for user classification. The platform also includes Compass for metric monitoring, Data Tables for raw data exploration, Journeys for user path analysis, and an Engagement Matrix for comprehensive user behavior mapping.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced statistical methods, experiment theory implementation, workflow management, results analysis, and troubleshooting tools. The platform supports both traditional A/B testing and sophisticated experimentation techniques through dedicated SDKs and APIs.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user interactions to provide visual context for behavioral data, enabling teams to understand the "why" behind user actions through recorded session playback and analysis.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** delivers in-product user engagement through contextual guides, feedback collection, and resource centers that help improve user onboarding, feature adoption, and overall product experience.

## Data Management and Integration Ecosystem

The **Customer Data Platform (CDP)** forms the backbone of Amplitude's data architecture, managing data ingestion, transformation, and distribution across the ecosystem. The platform supports extensive integrations through Source Catalog and Destination Catalog, enabling data flow from various touchpoints and distribution to downstream systems.

**Audiences** functionality allows for sophisticated user segmentation based on behavioral patterns, enabling targeted experiences and personalized product interactions. The platform includes PII (Personally Identifiable Information) integrations with appropriate privacy controls and data governance features.

**Warehouse-native Amplitude** extends analytics capabilities directly into existing data warehouse infrastructure, allowing organizations to leverage Amplitude's analytics engine on their own data storage systems without data movement requirements.

## SDK and API Infrastructure

Amplitude provides comprehensive instrumentation through multiple SDKs supporting various platforms and programming languages:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser SDK for web applications, Android and iOS SDKs for mobile platforms, React Native SDK for cross-platform mobile development, Flutter SDK for multi-platform applications, Node.js SDK for server-side implementation, Python SDK for data science workflows, Java SDK for enterprise applications, Go SDK for backend services, Unity SDK for game development, and Unreal SDK for advanced gaming applications.

**Experiment SDKs** provide dedicated feature flagging and experimentation capabilities across platforms, while **Ampli** offers a code-generation tool that creates type-safe analytics implementations based on tracking plans.

The **Analytics API** and **Experiment APIs** enable programmatic access to platform functionality, while the **Guides and Surveys API** supports automated user experience management.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** provides organizational controls for user access, permissions, and team collaboration. **Single Sign-On (SSO)** integration supports enterprise authentication systems, while **Billing and Use** management offers usage monitoring and cost optimization tools.

The platform includes comprehensive **FAQ and Troubleshooting** resources, **Migration** tools for transitioning from other analytics platforms, and **Academy Content** for user education and best practices.
