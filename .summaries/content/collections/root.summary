Amplitude is a comprehensive behavioral analytics platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior through event tracking, experimentation, and data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment (A/B testing), Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP) with extensive integration capabilities.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The platform operates through several core product areas that work synergistically:

**Analytics Core** serves as the foundational layer, providing behavioral event tracking through multiple SDKs (Android, iOS, Browser, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, Unreal) and the Analytics API. This feeds into various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Revenue LTV, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Data Tables, and Compass.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with dedicated SDKs and APIs, supporting advanced experimentation techniques, statistical theory implementation, and comprehensive result analysis through specialized charts.

**Session Replay** captures user interaction recordings for qualitative analysis, complementing quantitative behavioral data.

**Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user research and onboarding through targeted messaging and feedback collection.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion through Source Catalog (80+ integrations), data transformation, audience creation, and activation through Destination Catalog integrations.

**Ampli** provides type-safe analytics implementation with code generation for consistent event tracking across development teams.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Event Tracking**: Core behavioral data collection measuring user actions with properties, timestamps, and user identification.

**User ID/Device ID**: Primary identifiers for user tracking, with User ID for authenticated users and Device ID for anonymous tracking.

**Event Properties/User Properties**: Metadata attached to events and users for segmentation and analysis.

**Cohorts/Audiences**: User segments based on behavioral criteria, exportable to external platforms for activation.

**Feature Flags**: Dynamic configuration controls enabling gradual feature rollouts and experimentation.

**Variants**: Different versions of features or experiences in A/B tests.

**Statistical Significance**: Confidence level in experiment results, typically requiring 95% confidence.

**Lift**: Percentage improvement in key metrics from experimental variants.

**Attribution Window**: Time period for connecting user actions to marketing touchpoints.

**Schema Enforcement**: Data validation ensuring consistent event structure across implementations.

**Insert ID**: Unique identifier preventing duplicate event ingestion.

**Mount Points**: Content management system references (UUIDs) linking collections to specific content hierarchies.

**Navigation Injection**: System for organizing documentation content under specific navigation categories (analytics, experiment, data, apis, etc.).

**Blade References**: Product-specific branding indicators (Amplitude Experiment, Amplitude Session Replay, Amplitude Guides and Surveys).

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude operates as a comprehensive behavioral analytics ecosystem supporting Portfolio-level configurations for multi-product organizations. The platform integrates with marketing attribution systems (Facebook Ads, Google Ads, AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch), customer engagement platforms (Braze, HubSpot, Intercom), data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks), and subscription management systems (RevenueCat, Stripe).

The ecosystem enables end-to-end customer journey analysis by combining quantitative behavioral data with qualitative feedback, attribution insights, revenue metrics, and engagement data. This supports Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) and Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) calculations, comprehensive funnel optimization, and behavioral cohort activation across marketing channels.

Regional data center support (US and EU) ensures data residency compliance, while enterprise features include Single Sign-On (SSO), advanced account management, billing controls, and PII handling capabilities.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Core Analytics APIs**:
- HTTP V2 API (`/2/httpapi`) for real-time event ingestion
- Batch Upload API for high-volume data imports
- User Privacy API for GDPR/CCPA compliance
- Analytics Query API for programmatic data access

**Experiment APIs**:
- Feature Flag Management API for flag configuration
- Assignment API for variant delivery
- Results API for experiment performance data

**Authentication Methods**:
- API key authentication for standard integrations
- OAuth flows for marketing platforms
- Service account permissions for warehouse integrations
- Personal access tokens for enterprise systems

**SDK Implementation Patterns**:
- Platform-specific SDKs with consistent API surfaces
- Automatic session tracking and user identification
- Offline event queuing and retry mechanisms
- Real-time event validation and error handling

**Data Transformation Capabilities**:
- JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR for nested data processing
- VARIANT/STRUCT type handling for warehouse integrations
- EPOCH_MILLISECOND timestamp normalization
- Custom property mapping and schema validation

**File Ingestion Support**:
- Multiple formats (JSON, CSV, Parquet)
- Organizational structure requirements (YYYY/MM/DD/HH)
- File size constraints (1MB-1GB) for optimal processing
- Automated deduplication and error handling

The platform supports sophisticated data synchronization strategies including Change Data Capture (CDC), Mirror Sync, Append Only Sync, Timestamp Sync, and Full Sync for different integration requirements and data update patterns.
