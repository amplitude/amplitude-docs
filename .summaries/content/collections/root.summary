## Amplitude Product Documentation Ecosystem

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform consisting of multiple interconnected products for analytics, feature flagging, session recording, and customer data management. The documentation covers a full-stack analytics ecosystem with SDKs, APIs, and specialized tools for product teams, developers, and data analysts.

## Core Product Suite and Relationships

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational product, providing event tracking, user analytics, and behavioral insights through a comprehensive charting and analysis interface. The analytics platform supports multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Journeys, Compass, Data Tables, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, Revenue LTV, and legacy chart formats.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with both remote and local evaluation models. It integrates deeply with Analytics for exposure tracking and supports sophisticated targeting including cohort-based segmentation.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and reconstructs user interactions across web and mobile applications, providing visual insights through session recordings and heatmaps with configurable privacy controls.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and routing through source and destination catalogs, audiences, and warehouse-native capabilities.

**Ampli** serves as a code generation framework that creates strongly-typed APIs from tracking plans, ensuring implementation consistency across development teams.

## SDK Architecture and Platform Coverage

The platform provides comprehensive SDK coverage across multiple programming languages and platforms:

**Analytics SDKs**: Browser (JavaScript/TypeScript), Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine implementations with both current and legacy versions.

**Experiment SDKs**: Client-side and server-side implementations supporting remote and local evaluation models across JavaScript, React Native, Android, iOS, Node.js, JVM (Java/Kotlin), Python, Ruby, PHP, and Go.

**Session Replay SDKs**: Native implementations for Browser, Android, iOS, and React Native with plugin architectures for existing Analytics SDK integrations and standalone options for third-party analytics providers.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Concepts

**Core Identity Management**: Device ID, User ID, and Session ID serve as primary identifiers for user tracking and cross-platform analytics correlation.

**Event Tracking**: Events represent user actions with associated properties, tracked through `track()` methods across all SDKs with support for revenue tracking, user properties via `identify()`, and group analytics.

**Evaluation Models**: Remote evaluation fetches pre-computed variants from servers, while local evaluation downloads flag configurations for client-side processing with improved performance and offline capabilities.

**Data Residency**: ServerZone configuration supports US and EU data residency requirements for GDPR compliance across all products.

**Masking and Privacy**: Session Replay implements three masking levels (Conservative, Light, Medium) with CSS selector-based overrides and data attributes for privacy compliance.

**Cohort Targeting**: Advanced user segmentation enabling feature flags and experiments to target specific behavioral cohorts defined in Analytics.

**Autocapture**: Automatic tracking of user interactions including page views, form submissions, file downloads, and element interactions without manual instrumentation.

## API Endpoints and Integration Patterns

**Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/`) provides programmatic access to event data, user properties, and chart results with HTTP V2 endpoints for modern event ingestion.

**Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) support flag management, variant assignment, and exposure tracking with both REST and streaming interfaces.

**Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) enables programmatic management of in-app messaging and user feedback collection.

**CLI Tools**: Amplitude CLI supports Ampli code generation with commands like `ampli pull` for downloading tracking plans and `ampli status` for implementation verification.

**Integration Middleware**: Pre-built connectors for Segment, Rudderstack, and Google Tag Manager enable integration with existing analytics stacks while maintaining Amplitude's advanced capabilities.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** (`/admin/account-management/`) covers organizational settings, user permissions, and project configuration.

**Single Sign-On** (`/admin/single-sign-on/`) provides enterprise authentication integration with SAML and OAuth providers.

**Billing and Usage** (`/admin/billing-use/`) includes quota management, usage monitoring, and cost optimization tools.

**Data Governance**: PII integrations, data deletion APIs (DSAR), and privacy controls ensure compliance with data protection regulations.

## Advanced Analytics and Experimentation

**Advanced Techniques** (`/feature-experiment/advanced-techniques/`) covers sophisticated experimentation methodologies including statistical analysis, sample size calculations, and experiment design patterns.

**Experiment Theory** (`/feature-experiment/experiment-theory/`) provides foundational knowledge for A/B testing, statistical significance, and causal inference.

**Under the Hood** (`/feature-experiment/under-the-hood/`) explains the technical implementation of bucketing algorithms, assignment mechanisms, and data processing pipelines.

The platform supports multi-site deployment with English and Japanese localization, comprehensive troubleshooting documentation, migration guides for platform transitions, and partner integrations for extended ecosystem connectivity. The documentation structure reflects a mature, enterprise-grade analytics platform designed for technical implementation teams, product managers, and data analysts requiring sophisticated user behavior analysis and experimentation capabilities.
