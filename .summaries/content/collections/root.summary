Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive data-driven decision making across web and mobile applications.

## Product Architecture and Core Components

The platform consists of four primary product areas that work together to provide end-to-end analytics capabilities:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational data collection and analysis engine, offering event-based tracking through comprehensive SDKs (Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, Unreal) and the Analytics API. The platform supports multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Revenue LTV, and Experiment Results.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced statistical analysis, supporting experiment theory, workflow management, advanced techniques, and troubleshooting. The system includes dedicated Experiment SDKs and APIs for programmatic control.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and reconstructs user interactions through visual session recordings, heatmaps, and behavioral analytics while maintaining enterprise-grade privacy controls across web, mobile, and React Native platforms.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user engagement through targeted messaging and feedback collection, with dedicated APIs for programmatic management.

## Data Management and Integration Ecosystem

The Customer Data Platform (CDP) functionality centers around comprehensive data orchestration through Source and Destination Catalogs. The platform supports warehouse-native implementations, audience segmentation, and PII management with robust integration capabilities across the analytics ecosystem.

**SDK Architecture:** The Ampli wrapper provides type-safe analytics implementation across all supported platforms, while the SDK Catalog offers platform-specific analytics SDKs with consistent API patterns. Each SDK supports configurable data residency (US/EU server zones), privacy controls, and real-time event tracking.

**API Infrastructure:** The platform exposes Analytics APIs, Experiment APIs, and Guides and Surveys APIs for programmatic access to core functionality, enabling custom integrations and automated workflows.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** encompasses billing and usage monitoring, single sign-on (SSO) integration, and organizational administration. The platform provides comprehensive user management, role-based access controls, and enterprise security features.

**Partner Ecosystem** includes integrations with major analytics providers, marketing platforms, and data warehouses through the Source and Destination Catalogs, supporting both real-time and batch data synchronization.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Core Analytics Concepts:**
- `Events`: User actions tracked within applications (clicks, page views, purchases)
- `Properties`: Metadata associated with events and users for segmentation
- `Cohorts`: User segments based on behavioral or demographic criteria
- `Funnels`: Sequential user journey analysis through defined conversion steps
- `Retention`: User return behavior analysis over specified time periods

**Experimentation Framework:**
- `Feature Flags`: Boolean toggles for feature rollout control
- `Variants`: Different versions of features tested in experiments
- `Statistical Significance`: Confidence level in experiment results
- `Sample Rate`: Percentage of users included in experiments

**Data Management:**
- `Sources`: Data input connectors from various platforms and applications
- `Destinations`: Data output connectors to external systems and warehouses
- `Transformations`: Data processing rules applied during ingestion
- `Audiences`: Behavioral segments exported to external marketing platforms

**Privacy and Compliance:**
- `Data Residency`: Geographic data storage controls (US/EU)
- `Masking Levels`: Privacy protection intensity (Conservative/Light/Medium)
- `Consent Management`: GDPR/CCPA compliance framework integration
- `PII Handling`: Personally identifiable information processing controls

## Integration Patterns and Technical Implementation

**Route Structure:** The documentation reveals a hierarchical URL structure with dedicated sections for each product area:
- `/analytics/` for core analytics functionality and charts
- `/feature-experiment/` for experimentation features
- `/session-replay/` for user behavior recording
- `/data/` for CDP and data management
- `/sdks/` for development tools and instrumentation
- `/apis/` for programmatic access
- `/admin/` for organizational management

**Multi-language Support:** The platform includes Japanese localization (`sites: jp`) with dedicated translation collections, indicating international market support.

**Content Management:** The system uses a sophisticated content management approach with mount points, taxonomies (integration_category), and structured navigation injection, enabling scalable documentation and feature organization.

**Development Workflow:** The platform supports migration paths for existing implementations, comprehensive FAQ and troubleshooting resources, and academy content for user education and onboarding.

The collections structure reveals a mature, enterprise-grade analytics platform designed for technical teams requiring comprehensive user behavior analysis, experimentation capabilities, and data management tools across diverse technology stacks and organizational requirements.
