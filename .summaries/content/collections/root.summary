Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools for behavioral analytics, feature experimentation, customer data management, and user engagement optimization. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products designed to support data-driven decision making across the entire product development lifecycle.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform is built around several primary products that work together to provide a complete analytics and experimentation solution:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational behavioral analytics platform, offering event tracking, user journey analysis, and comprehensive reporting through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Cohort Analysis, and Revenue LTV tracking. The analytics engine supports real-time data processing and provides insights into user behavior patterns, conversion optimization, and product performance metrics.

**Amplitude Experiment** is a behavioral experimentation and feature flag platform that enables A/B testing and progressive feature delivery. It operates through a workflow-driven approach supporting both statistical experimentation with hypothesis testing and feature flagging for controlled rollouts. The system uses hierarchical data models with organizations, projects, deployments, flags/experiments, variants, and users, supporting both local and remote evaluation modes.

**Amplitude CDP (Customer Data Platform)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and distribution across the ecosystem. It includes source and destination catalogs for third-party integrations, audience management capabilities, and data governance tools. The CDP supports real-time data streaming and batch processing, enabling organizations to create unified customer profiles and activate data across multiple touchpoints.

**Amplitude Session Replay** provides detailed user session recordings and behavioral insights, allowing teams to understand user interactions at a granular level and identify optimization opportunities.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user engagement through targeted messaging, onboarding flows, and feedback collection mechanisms.

## Analytics and Visualization Capabilities

The platform offers extensive charting and visualization capabilities organized into specific chart types:

**Event Segmentation** provides detailed analysis of user actions and behaviors, supporting complex segmentation and filtering capabilities. **Funnel Analysis** tracks user progression through defined conversion paths, identifying drop-off points and optimization opportunities. **Retention Analysis** measures user engagement over time, calculating cohort-based retention metrics and lifecycle patterns.

**User Sessions** analyzes session-based metrics including duration, frequency, and engagement patterns. **Journeys** maps user pathways through products, identifying common navigation patterns and user flows. **Compass** provides automated insights and anomaly detection, surfacing significant changes in user behavior.

**Personas** enables behavioral segmentation and user clustering based on activity patterns. **Lifecycle** tracks user progression through defined stages, measuring activation, engagement, and retention metrics. **Revenue LTV** calculates customer lifetime value and revenue attribution across user segments.

Additional specialized charts include **Engagement Matrix** for measuring feature adoption, **Impact Analysis** for measuring experiment effects, **Stickiness** for analyzing user engagement frequency, and **Data Tables** for detailed metric exploration.

## SDK and Integration Ecosystem

Amplitude provides comprehensive SDK support across multiple platforms and programming languages:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser SDK (JavaScript), iOS SDK (Swift/Objective-C), Android SDK (Kotlin/Java), React Native SDK, Flutter SDK, Unity SDK, Unreal SDK, Node.js SDK, Python SDK, Java SDK, and Go SDK. Each SDK provides event tracking, user identification, and real-time data transmission capabilities.

**Experiment SDKs** support feature flag evaluation and A/B testing across the same platform ecosystem, with both local and remote evaluation capabilities. **Ampli** provides type-safe analytics implementation with code generation and validation tools.

## API Infrastructure

The platform exposes multiple API endpoints for programmatic access:

- **Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/`) for event ingestion and data retrieval
- **Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) for flag management and evaluation
- **Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) for in-product messaging management

APIs support REST protocols with authentication through API keys and support both real-time and batch data operations.

## Data Management and Governance

**Source Catalog** provides pre-built integrations for data ingestion from various platforms including web analytics, mobile analytics, marketing automation, and customer support tools. **Destination Catalog** enables data activation through integrations with advertising platforms, email marketing tools, data warehouses, and business intelligence platforms.

**Audiences** functionality allows creation of dynamic user segments based on behavioral data, with real-time updates and cross-platform activation capabilities. **Warehouse-native Amplitude** supports direct integration with cloud data warehouses, enabling analysis of existing data without migration requirements.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** provides organization-level controls including user permissions, project management, and access controls. **Single Sign-on** supports enterprise authentication through SAML and OAuth protocols. **Billing and Use** offers usage monitoring, plan management, and cost optimization tools.

The platform implements role-based access control with multiple permission levels (Viewer, Member, Manager, Admin) and supports project-level permissions independent across different products.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** represent user actions tracked within the platform, containing properties and timestamps. **Users** are identified through user_id or device_id with associated properties and behavioral data. **Cohorts** are dynamic user segments based on behavioral criteria or static user lists.

**Experiments** are A/B tests with statistical analysis capabilities, while **Feature Flags** enable controlled feature rollouts without statistical tracking. **Variants** represent different versions of features or experiences within experiments.

**Deployments** categorize implementation environments (client-side vs server-side) with unique configuration keys. **Bucketing** determines user assignment to experiment variants using consistent hashing algorithms.

## Ecosystem Integration and Workflow

The platform supports end-to-end product analytics workflows from data collection through analysis and experimentation. Analytics data informs experiment targeting and segmentation, while experiment results feed back into behavioral analysis and product optimization decisions.

Integration capabilities extend to third-party tools through APIs, webhooks, and pre-built connectors, enabling organizations to incorporate Amplitude into existing technology stacks and workflows. The platform supports both real-time and batch data processing, accommodating various use cases from immediate personalization to long-term trend analysis.

Command-line tools and programmatic access enable automation of common tasks including data export, experiment management, and report generation, supporting DevOps and continuous integration workflows.
