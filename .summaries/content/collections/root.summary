# Amplitude Documentation Platform

## Product Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that helps businesses understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and make data-driven decisions. The platform consists of several key components:

1. **Analytics** - Core analytics functionality for tracking and analyzing user behavior
2. **Experiment** - A/B testing and feature experimentation capabilities
3. **CDP (Customer Data Platform)** - Data management and integration
4. **Session Replay** - Visual recording of user sessions
5. **SDKs** - Client and server libraries for various platforms

The documentation is organized into collections that cover different aspects of the platform, including product features, SDKs, APIs, integration catalogs, and educational content.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The documentation reveals how Amplitude's products work together in an integrated ecosystem:

1. **Data Flow**:
   - Data is collected via SDKs and APIs
   - Processed through the CDP
   - Analyzed in Analytics
   - Used for experimentation in Experiment
   - Visualized in Session Replay

2. **Integration Architecture**:
   - Source Catalog connects external data sources to Amplitude
   - Destination Catalog sends Amplitude data to external tools
   - Warehouse Native Amplitude enables direct data warehouse connections

3. **Cross-Product Features**:
   - Audiences created in Analytics can be used in Experiment
   - Experiment results can be analyzed in Analytics charts
   - Session Replay provides visual context for Analytics data

4. **Developer Tools**:
   - SDKs for multiple platforms share common instrumentation patterns
   - APIs provide programmatic access to platform capabilities
   - Ampli provides type-safe instrumentation across SDKs

## API and Implementation Details

1. **Analytics API**
   - Endpoint pattern: `/apis/analytics/{endpoint}`
   - Used for programmatic access to analytics data

2. **Experiment APIs**
   - Endpoint pattern: `/apis/experiment/{endpoint}`
   - Used for managing experiments and feature flags

3. **SDK Implementation Patterns**
   - All SDKs follow a consistent route pattern: `/sdks/{platform}/{slug}`
   - Platform-specific SDKs have dedicated documentation sections
   - Common implementation patterns across platforms

4. **Web Experiment Implementation**
   - Route pattern: `/web-experiment/{slug}`
   - Specific implementation details for web-based experimentation

5. **Data Integration**
   - Source catalog: `/data/source-catalog/{slug}`
   - Destination catalog: `/data/destination-catalog/{slug}`
   - PII integrations: `/data/pii/{slug}`

The documentation is structured to support multiple languages (primarily English with some Japanese translations) and uses a consistent template system with specific navigation patterns for each product area.
