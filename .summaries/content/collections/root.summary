Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of several interconnected products that work together to provide end-to-end analytics and experimentation capabilities.

## Core Product Architecture

The Amplitude ecosystem is built around four primary product areas:

**Analytics Platform** - The foundational analytics engine that captures, processes, and visualizes user behavior data through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, Cohort Analysis (Lifecycle), User Journey mapping, Revenue LTV analysis, and specialized charts like Compass, Personas, Stickiness, and Engagement Matrix.

**Amplitude Experiment** - A feature flagging and A/B testing platform that enables teams to run controlled experiments, manage feature rollouts, and measure impact. This includes advanced experimentation techniques, statistical theory, workflow management, and comprehensive result analysis capabilities.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** - A unified data layer that manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation across the customer journey. This includes source and destination catalogs, audience management, data governance, and warehouse-native capabilities.

**Amplitude Session Replay** - A user experience analysis tool that captures and replays user sessions to provide qualitative insights into user behavior and identify optimization opportunities.

## Product Integration and Data Flow

The platform operates through a unified data architecture where:

- **Data Ingestion** occurs through multiple SDKs (Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, Unreal) and source integrations
- **Data Processing** happens within the CDP layer, which cleanses, transforms, and routes data to appropriate destinations
- **Analytics and Experimentation** consume this processed data to generate insights and power experiments
- **Data Activation** flows back to external systems through the destination catalog and APIs

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Collections** represent different content categories within the documentation system, each with specific routing patterns and navigation contexts.

**Mount Points** (identified by UUIDs) link collections to specific content repositories, enabling modular content management.

**Navigation Contexts** include:
- `analytics` - Core analytics features and charts
- `experiment` - Feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities  
- `data` - CDP, sources, destinations, and data management
- `apis` - REST APIs for programmatic access
- `analytics_sdks` / `experiment_sdks` - Client-side instrumentation libraries
- `admin` - Account management, billing, and SSO configuration

**Blade Architecture** refers to product-specific UI contexts, with "Amplitude Experiment" and "Amplitude Session Replay" representing distinct product experiences within the platform.

## API and Integration Endpoints

The platform exposes several API categories:

- **Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/`) - For querying analytics data and managing analytics resources
- **Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) - For managing feature flags, experiments, and retrieving experiment results
- **Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) - For managing in-product messaging and feedback collection

## SDK and Implementation Patterns

Analytics SDKs follow consistent routing patterns (`/sdks/analytics/{platform}/`) and provide instrumentation for:
- Web platforms (Browser, React Native)
- Mobile platforms (iOS, Android, Flutter, React Native)
- Server-side platforms (Node.js, Python, Java, Go)
- Game engines (Unity, Unreal)

The **Ampli** code generation tool (`/sdks/ampli/`) provides type-safe analytics implementation across platforms.

## Content Localization and Multi-tenancy

The platform supports internationalization with English (`en`) as the primary locale and Japanese (`jp`) translations available for key content areas. Content propagation settings control how updates flow across different site versions.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

Enterprise capabilities include:
- **Single Sign-On** integration for enterprise authentication
- **Account Management** for user and organization administration  
- **Billing and Usage** monitoring and management
- **PII Management** for data privacy compliance

The documentation architecture reflects a mature, enterprise-grade platform designed to scale from startup analytics needs to complex enterprise experimentation and data management requirements.
