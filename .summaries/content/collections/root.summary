Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive data-driven decision making across web, mobile, and server-side applications.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The platform consists of four core product areas that work together to provide end-to-end analytics and experimentation capabilities:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational data collection and analysis engine, providing event tracking, user segmentation, and behavioral analytics through a comprehensive suite of chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Personas, Compass, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Stickiness, Revenue LTV, Data Tables, and Experiment Results charts.

**Amplitude Experiment** enables feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities, with dedicated sections for experiment theory, advanced techniques, workflow management, troubleshooting, and "under the hood" technical implementation details.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user session recordings to provide qualitative insights into user behavior and experience issues.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** facilitates in-product user research and guidance through targeted surveys and user onboarding flows.

The platform is supported by a robust **Customer Data Platform (CDP)** that manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation through sources, destinations, audiences, and warehouse-native capabilities.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Collections**: Content organization structure that groups related documentation by product area, feature set, or user journey stage.

**Mount Points**: Unique identifiers (UUIDs) that link collections to specific content hierarchies and enable content reuse across different sections.

**Navigation Injection**: System for dynamically assigning content to specific navigation categories (nav_title) such as analytics, experiment, data, apis, etc.

**Route Patterns**: URL structure definitions that determine how content is organized and accessed, following patterns like `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/{slug}` or `/sdks/{platform}/{slug}`.

**Blade Attribution**: Product-specific labeling system that associates content with specific Amplitude products (e.g., "Amplitude Experiment", "Amplitude Session Replay").

**Sites and Propagation**: Multi-language content management system supporting English ('en') and Japanese ('jp') localization with controlled content propagation.

**Date Behavior**: Content visibility controls that manage when documentation becomes publicly accessible, with past content set to public and future content remaining private until publication.

## SDK and API Ecosystem

The platform provides extensive developer tooling through multiple SDK categories:

**Analytics SDKs** support comprehensive platform coverage including Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine implementations, all following consistent instrumentation patterns and API designs.

**Experiment SDKs** provide feature flagging and experimentation capabilities across the same platform ecosystem, enabling consistent A/B testing implementation regardless of technology stack.

**Ampli** serves as a type-safe wrapper and code generation tool that creates strongly-typed analytics implementations based on tracking plans, reducing implementation errors and improving developer experience.

**API Endpoints** include:
- Analytics API (`/apis/analytics/`) for data querying and export
- Experiment APIs (`/apis/experiment/`) for feature flag management and experiment configuration
- Guides and Surveys API (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) for in-product experience management

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

The platform includes comprehensive administrative capabilities organized into several key areas:

**Account Management** provides user provisioning, role-based access control, and organizational structure management.

**Single Sign-On** enables enterprise authentication integration with SAML and OAuth providers.

**Billing and Usage** offers consumption monitoring, plan management, and cost optimization tools.

**Data Management** includes PII handling, data governance, warehouse-native integrations, and comprehensive source/destination catalog management for third-party integrations.

## Content Organization and User Experience

The documentation architecture supports multiple user personas and use cases:

**Get Started** content provides onboarding flows for new users and implementation guidance.

**Migration** resources assist users transitioning from other analytics platforms or upgrading between Amplitude versions.

**FAQ and Troubleshooting** sections offer self-service support across all product areas.

**Academy Content** delivers educational resources and best practices.

**Partners** documentation covers integration development and marketplace participation.

The platform supports both English and Japanese localization, with dedicated translation collections and region-specific content management. Preview functionality enables content validation before publication, while structured navigation injection ensures consistent user experience across all product areas.

This comprehensive ecosystem enables organizations to implement sophisticated analytics and experimentation workflows while maintaining flexibility in technology choices and integration patterns.
