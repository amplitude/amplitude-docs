## Amplitude Browser SDK 2

Amplitude Browser SDK 2 is a comprehensive JavaScript/TypeScript analytics library that serves as Amplitude's primary client-side data collection solution. The SDK enables organizations to capture detailed user behavior analytics through both manual event tracking and extensive autocapture functionality, transmitting data to Amplitude's analytics platform via the HTTP V2 API.

## Product Architecture and Core Features

The Browser SDK 2 operates on a plugin-based architecture supporting enrichment plugins for data transformation and destination plugins for data routing. The SDK offers multiple installation methods including script loader, npm, and yarn, with package options ranging from unified installation (`@amplitude/unified`) to dedicated browser packages (`@amplitude/analytics-browser`) for bundle size optimization.

### Comprehensive Autocapture System

The SDK's autocapture functionality represents its most sophisticated feature set, automatically collecting user interaction data without explicit instrumentation:

- **Marketing Attribution Tracking**: Captures UTM parameters and click ID parameters for comprehensive campaign attribution analysis
- **Page View and Navigation Tracking**: Monitors page transitions and navigation events across single-page applications
- **Session Management**: Handles automated session tracking with configurable session parameters and timeout settings
- **Form Interaction Analytics**: Captures form submissions, field interactions, and form abandonment events
- **File Download Monitoring**: Tracks file download events with metadata about file types and sources
- **Element Interaction Tracking**: Records clicks and interactions with page elements, supporting CSS selector-based targeting
- **Frustration Signal Detection**: Identifies user frustration patterns including rage clicks, dead clicks, and rapid successive interactions
- **Network Request Analytics**: Monitors XHR and Fetch API calls for performance and user journey analytics

### User Identity and Revenue Analytics

The SDK provides sophisticated user analytics capabilities through multiple identification and tracking mechanisms:
- **User Properties Management**: Implemented via the Identify interface for comprehensive user attribute tracking
- **Group Properties**: Enables organizational and cohort-based analytics for B2B use cases
- **Revenue Tracking Interface**: Dedicated methods for e-commerce analytics, transaction tracking, and monetization metrics

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

- **deviceId and userId**: Primary user identification parameters with configurable validation through `minIdLength` settings
- **flushQueueSize and flushIntervalMillis**: Critical configuration parameters controlling event batching behavior and transmission frequency to optimize performance and data delivery
- **sendBeacon**: Browser API-based transport method ensuring reliable event delivery even during page unload scenarios
- **ampDeviceId and ampSessionId**: URL parameters facilitating cross-domain tracking continuity and user session persistence
- **AMP cookie prefix**: Standardized cookie naming convention for data persistence and cross-domain identity resolution
- **trackingOptions**: Comprehensive configuration object controlling the scope and granularity of automatic data collection
- **excludeReferrers**: Configuration mechanism for filtering referrer data to comply with privacy requirements
- **fetchRemoteConfig**: Server-side configuration retrieval method enabling dynamic SDK behavior modification

## Ecosystem Integration and Framework Support

The Browser SDK 2 integrates seamlessly with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem through the HTTP V2 API, ensuring reliable data flow to Amplitude's analytics platform. The SDK provides optimized support for modern web development frameworks:

- **Angular Integration**: Full compatibility with Zone.js for proper change detection and lifecycle management
- **Next.js Optimization**: Specialized integration patterns for server-side rendered applications and static site generation
- **Visual Labeling Support**: Native compatibility with Amplitude's visual event labeling tools for no-code analytics implementation

### Enterprise-Grade Advanced Features

The SDK delivers enterprise-level capabilities for complex deployment scenarios:

- **Cross-Domain Tracking**: Maintains user identity continuity across different domains using URL parameter passing and cookie synchronization
- **Offline Mode**: Implements intelligent event queuing when network connectivity is unavailable, with automatic retry mechanisms
- **Content Security Policy (CSP) Compliance**: Configurable for deployment in secure environments with strict CSP requirements
- **Advanced Cookie Management**: Flexible cookie handling with customizable prefixes, domains, and expiration policies
- **Remote Configuration**: Dynamic configuration updates via `fetchRemoteConfig` enabling real-time SDK behavior modification

## API Surface and Implementation Methods

The SDK exposes a comprehensive API including:
- Custom event tracking methods with flexible property schemas
- Autocapture configuration methods for granular control over automatic data collection
- Plugin registration system for extensibility and custom data processing
- User and group property management interfaces supporting complex identity resolution
- Specialized revenue tracking methods for e-commerce analytics

The implementation architecture supports both unified package deployment for comprehensive analytics coverage and modular installation for specific use cases, enabling organizations to optimize bundle sizes while maintaining full analytical capabilities across their web properties.
