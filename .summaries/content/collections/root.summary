Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive data-driven decision making across web and mobile applications.

## High-Level Product Overview

Amplitude consists of four core product areas: **Analytics** (behavioral analysis and reporting), **Experiment** (feature flagging and A/B testing), **CDP** (Customer Data Platform for data management), and **Session Replay** (visual user behavior analysis). The platform serves both technical implementers through extensive SDK libraries and business users through intuitive analytics interfaces.

The platform operates on an event-driven architecture where user interactions are captured via SDKs, processed through Amplitude's analytics engine, and surfaced through various chart types, APIs, and visualization tools. Organizations can instrument their applications using Amplitude's native SDKs or integrate through third-party platforms like Segment.

## Product Relationships and Feature Architecture

**Analytics Core**: The analytics engine processes behavioral data through multiple specialized chart types including Event Segmentation (trend analysis), Funnel Analysis (conversion tracking), Retention Analysis (user stickiness), Cohort Analysis (user grouping), and Revenue LTV (monetization metrics). Advanced visualizations include Compass (KPI monitoring), Journeys (user path analysis), and Personas (behavioral clustering).

**Experimentation Suite**: Amplitude Experiment provides feature flag management, A/B testing capabilities, and statistical analysis tools. It integrates with the analytics platform for experiment result measurement and includes advanced techniques for complex testing scenarios. The system supports both client-side and server-side experimentation through dedicated SDKs.

**Data Management Layer**: The CDP functionality manages data ingestion through source catalogs, data transformation, audience creation, and activation through destination catalogs. This includes warehouse-native capabilities for organizations preferring to keep data in their existing infrastructure.

**Developer Tools**: Ampli provides type-safe analytics implementation, while comprehensive SDK catalogs support multiple programming languages and platforms. APIs enable programmatic access to analytics data, experiment configuration, and administrative functions.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Analytics Concepts:**
- **Events**: User actions tracked within applications (clicks, page views, purchases)
- **Properties**: Attributes associated with events (user ID, device type, revenue amount)
- **Cohorts**: User segments based on behavioral criteria or properties
- **Funnels**: Sequential event analysis measuring conversion rates
- **Retention**: User return behavior analysis over time periods
- **Segmentation**: Event volume and trend analysis with dimensional breakdowns

**Experimentation Terms:**
- **Feature Flags**: Boolean toggles controlling feature availability
- **Variants**: Different versions of features being tested
- **Allocation**: Percentage of users exposed to experiments
- **Statistical Significance**: Confidence level in experiment results
- **Holdout Groups**: Control populations for measuring overall impact

**Data Platform Concepts:**
- **Sources**: Data ingestion points (SDKs, server APIs, third-party integrations)
- **Destinations**: Data activation endpoints (marketing tools, data warehouses)
- **Transformations**: Data processing rules applied during ingestion
- **Schemas**: Data structure definitions ensuring consistency
- **Audiences**: Behavioral segments available for activation

**Technical Infrastructure:**
- **Device ID**: Unique identifier for device-level tracking
- **User ID**: Business identifier for cross-device user tracking
- **Session ID**: Temporary identifier grouping related user actions
- **Amplitude ID**: Internal user identifier for identity resolution

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates with the broader marketing and product technology stack through multiple integration patterns. The platform connects with data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift) for bidirectional data flow, marketing automation platforms for audience activation, and development tools through webhook integrations.

The **Source Catalog** includes pre-built integrations with popular tools like Salesforce, Zendesk, and Stripe, while the **Destination Catalog** enables data activation in platforms like Facebook Ads, Google Ads, and Braze. **Partner integrations** extend functionality through specialized use cases and industry-specific solutions.

**Warehouse-native Amplitude** allows organizations to run Amplitude analytics directly on their existing data warehouse infrastructure, maintaining data residency while accessing Amplitude's analytics capabilities.

## API Endpoints and Technical Integration

**Analytics APIs** provide programmatic access to chart data, cohort definitions, and behavioral metrics through RESTful endpoints. Key endpoints include:
- `/api/2/events/segmentation` for event analysis
- `/api/2/funnels` for conversion funnel data  
- `/api/3/cohorts` for audience management
- `/api/2/retention` for user retention metrics

**Experiment APIs** enable feature flag management and experiment configuration:
- `/api/1/flags` for feature flag CRUD operations
- `/api/1/experiments` for A/B test management
- `/api/1/results` for experiment performance data

**Administrative APIs** support account management, user provisioning, and billing operations through dedicated endpoints under `/admin/` routes.

**SDK Integration** occurs through platform-specific libraries including Browser SDK, Android SDK, iOS SDK, React Native SDK, and server-side SDKs for Node.js, Python, Java, and Go. Each SDK provides consistent event tracking methods (`track()`, `identify()`, `setUserProperties()`) while accommodating platform-specific implementation patterns.

The platform supports both real-time and batch data processing, with configurable data residency options (US/EU server zones) and enterprise-grade security controls including SSO integration, role-based access control, and audit logging capabilities.
