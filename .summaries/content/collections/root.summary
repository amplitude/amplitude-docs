# Amplitude Analytics Platform

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics platform that provides product teams with behavioral analytics, experimentation capabilities, and user engagement insights. The platform centers around event-based tracking to understand user journeys, measure product performance, and optimize user experiences through data-driven decision making.

## Core Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem consists of several interconnected products and features:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the core analytics engine, featuring multiple chart types for different analytical needs:
- **Event Segmentation** charts for tracking user actions and behaviors over time
- **Funnel Analysis** for conversion tracking and optimization
- **Retention Analysis** for measuring user engagement and churn
- **Lifecycle** charts for user state transitions and engagement patterns
- **Stickiness** analysis for measuring user engagement frequency
- **User Sessions** charts for session-based analytics
- **Personas** for behavioral clustering using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
- **Journeys** for path analysis and user flow visualization
- **Compass** for metric monitoring and alerting
- **Data Tables** for multi-dimensional data exploration
- **Revenue LTV** for lifetime value analysis
- **Impact Analysis** for measuring feature impact
- **Engagement Matrix** for cohort-based engagement tracking
- **Experiment Results** charts for A/B test analysis integration

**Amplitude Experiment** provides A/B testing and feature flagging capabilities with sophisticated statistical analysis including sequential testing methodology and mutual exclusion groups to prevent cross-experiment contamination. The platform supports both remote and local evaluation models, advanced techniques, experiment theory, workflow management, and comprehensive troubleshooting capabilities.

**Amplitude Data (CDP)** handles data governance through tracking plans, offering event and property management with hide/block/delete functionality. It includes comprehensive source and destination catalogs, audience management, warehouse-native capabilities, and PII integration handling.

**Amplitude Session Replay** provides user session recording and analysis capabilities for understanding user behavior patterns and identifying friction points.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user engagement through guided experiences and feedback collection.

**Web Experiment** offers specialized experimentation capabilities for web-based applications.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Identifiers:**
- **User ID**: Custom identifier for known users
- **Device ID**: Platform-specific identifier (Android UUID, iOS IDFV/IDFA)
- **Amplitude ID**: Internal unique identifier for user profiles
- **Session ID**: Identifier for user session tracking with configurable timeout windows

**Data Structure:**
- **Events**: User actions tracked with timestamps and properties
- **Event Properties**: Attributes specific to individual events
- **User Properties**: Attributes associated with user profiles
- **MTU (Monthly Tracked Users)**: Billing metric for unique users per calendar month

**Analytics Concepts:**
- **Group-by**: Segmentation dimension for breaking down metrics
- **Filter-by**: Conditions for including/excluding data
- **Conversion Windows**: Time periods for funnel step completion (24-hour vs calendar-based)
- **Retention Types**: "Return On" vs "Return On or After" calculation methods
- **Cohorts**: User segments based on behavioral patterns or properties
- **Audiences**: Dynamic user segments for targeting and personalization

**Experimentation Terms:**
- **Allocation**: Percentage of users exposed to experiment variants
- **Payload Variables**: Configuration data passed with variant assignments
- **Exposure Events**: Tracked when users encounter feature flag variants
- **Assignment Events**: Server-side tracking of variant assignments
- **Guardrail Metrics**: Secondary metrics monitoring for negative impacts
- **Bucketing Units**: User identification method (user_id, device_id, or groups)
- **Targeting Segments**: User criteria for experiment inclusion
- **Mutual Exclusion Groups**: Preventing user overlap between experiments
- **Sequential Testing**: Always-valid statistical methodology for experiments
- **MDE (Minimum Detectable Effect)**: Smallest change an experiment can reliably detect
