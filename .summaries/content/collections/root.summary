# Amplitude Product Documentation Overview

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that helps teams understand user behavior, make data-driven decisions, and optimize digital experiences. The platform consists of several integrated products:

1. **Analytics** - Core analytics platform for tracking, visualizing, and analyzing user behavior
2. **Experiment** - Feature flag and A/B testing platform for controlled experimentation
3. **CDP (Customer Data Platform)** - Data management solution for unifying customer data
4. **Session Replay** - Visual recording of user sessions for qualitative analysis
5. **Guides and Surveys** - In-app messaging and feedback collection tools

The platform supports multiple deployment options, including various SDKs for different programming languages and platforms, APIs for programmatic access, and integrations with third-party tools.

## Product and Feature Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem is organized into several interconnected components:

### Analytics Core
- **Charts** - Visualization tools including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Personas, Impact Analysis, and Legacy Charts
- **Data Management** - Tools for managing data sources, destinations, audiences, and PII
- **SDKs** - Client and server libraries for different platforms (Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal, Node.js, Python, Java, Go)

### Experiment Platform
- **Feature Flags** - Toggle features on/off or test variants
- **A/B Testing** - Compare different versions of features
- **SDKs** - Client and server libraries for experiment implementation
- **APIs** - Management and evaluation endpoints for programmatic control

### Administration
- **Account Management** - User and organization settings
- **Billing and Usage** - Subscription and consumption tracking
- **Single Sign-On** - Enterprise authentication options

### Integrations
- **Source Catalog** - Data import connections
- **Destination Catalog** - Data export connections
- **Partners** - Third-party integration options

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event** - A user action or system occurrence tracked in Amplitude
- **User Properties** - Attributes associated with users for segmentation
- **Cohort** - A defined group of users meeting specific criteria
- **Variant** - A specific version of a feature in an experiment
- **Flag** - A feature toggle that controls access to functionality
- **Experiment** - A controlled test comparing different variants
- **Deployment** - An environment configuration (e.g., production, staging)
- **SDK (Software Development Kit)** - Libraries for implementing Amplitude in applications
- **API (Application Programming Interface)** - Endpoints for programmatic interaction
- **Bucketing** - The process of assigning users to experiment variants
- **Exposure** - When a user encounters a feature flag or experiment

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude platform components work together to provide an end-to-end solution:

1. **Data Collection** - SDKs and APIs capture user behavior across platforms
2. **Data Processing** - CDP and data management tools organize and structure data
3. **Analysis** - Analytics charts and visualizations provide insights
4. **Experimentation** - Experiment platform tests hypotheses based on analytics
5. **Engagement** - Guides and surveys interact with users based on behavior
6. **Optimization** - Session Replay provides qualitative context for quantitative data

The platform supports both client-side and server-side implementations, with options for local or remote evaluation of experiments.

## API Endpoints and Implementation Details

### Analytics API
- Base URL: Not explicitly specified in the documentation
- Key endpoints for querying analytics data and managing users

### Experiment Management API
- Base URL: `https://management-api.experiment.amplitude.com`
- EU Regional endpoint: `https://management-api.eu.experiment.amplitude.com`
- Authentication: `Authorization: Bearer {management_api_key}`
- Endpoints for managing flags, experiments, deployments, mutex groups, and holdout groups

### Experiment Evaluation API
- Endpoint: `GET /api/2/variantAssignments`
- Parameters: flag_keys, user_id, device_id, user_properties, context
- Headers: `Authorization: Api-Key {deployment_key}`

### SDK Implementation
All SDKs implement similar interfaces with core methods:
- **initialize/init**: Configure the SDK
- **logEvent/track**: Record user actions
- **setUserId/identify**: Manage user identity
- **fetch/evaluate**: Retrieve experiment variants
- **exposure/track**: Record experiment exposures

The platform supports multiple deployment options including Docker containers, Kubernetes with Helm charts, and standard package managers for each supported language and platform.
