Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of several interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Core Product Architecture and Relationships

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, offering multiple chart types for behavioral analysis including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Stickiness, Lifecycle, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Revenue LTV, and Experiment Results. These charts provide comprehensive user behavior insights through cohort analysis, conversion tracking, and user journey mapping.

**Amplitude Experiment** integrates tightly with the analytics platform to provide feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities. It includes advanced techniques for experimentation, experiment theory documentation, workflow management, troubleshooting resources, and "under the hood" technical implementation details. The platform supports both client-side and server-side experimentation with statistical analysis and results visualization.

**Session Replay** captures and analyzes user interactions to provide qualitative insights that complement quantitative analytics data, enabling teams to understand the "why" behind user behaviors identified in charts and funnels.

**Guides and Surveys** delivers in-product user experience optimization through contextual guidance, feedback collection, and help resources, leveraging analytics data for targeting and personalization.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation through source and destination catalogs, audience management, and warehouse-native capabilities.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Events** represent user actions tracked within applications, forming the foundation of all analytics and experimentation workflows. Events contain properties that provide contextual information about user interactions.

**Cohorts** are user segments defined by shared characteristics or behaviors, used across the platform for targeting experiments, personalizing experiences, and analyzing user groups.

**Funnels** track user progression through defined sequences of events, measuring conversion rates and identifying drop-off points in user journeys.

**Retention** measures user return behavior over time, typically calculated as the percentage of users who perform a specific action within defined time windows.

**Amplitude IDs** serve as unique user identifiers that persist across sessions and devices, enabling accurate user tracking and cross-platform analytics.

**Feature Flags** control feature visibility and behavior in applications, enabling gradual rollouts, A/B testing, and rapid feature toggling without code deployments.

**Variants** represent different versions of features or experiences in experiments, allowing teams to test multiple approaches simultaneously.

**Statistical Significance** indicates the confidence level that observed differences between experiment variants are not due to random chance.

## SDK and API Infrastructure

The platform provides comprehensive SDK support across multiple programming languages and platforms:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser SDK, Android SDK, iOS SDK, React Native SDK, Flutter SDK, Node.js SDK, Python SDK, Java SDK, Go SDK, Unity SDK, and Unreal SDK. Each SDK provides event tracking, user identification, and configuration management with platform-specific optimizations.

**Experiment SDKs** offer feature flag evaluation and experiment assignment across the same platform coverage, with local evaluation capabilities for performance optimization.

**Ampli** provides a code-generation tool that creates type-safe analytics implementations based on tracking plans, ensuring data quality and consistency across development teams.

**APIs** include the Analytics API for server-side event ingestion and data export, Experiment APIs for feature flag management and evaluation, and Guides and Surveys API for experience management.

Common API endpoints include:
- `/api/2/httpapi` for Analytics event ingestion
- `/sdk/vardata` for Experiment flag evaluation
- `/api/1/export` for data export operations

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates with hundreds of third-party tools through its **Source Catalog** and **Destination Catalog**, enabling data collection from various platforms and activation across marketing, product, and analytics tools. The platform supports real-time data streaming, batch processing, and warehouse-native architectures.

**Data Management** capabilities include PII handling, data governance, audience creation and syndication, and warehouse-native Amplitude for organizations preferring to keep data in their own infrastructure.

**Administrative Features** encompass account management, billing and usage monitoring, single sign-on (SSO) integration, user permissions, and organizational settings management.

**Migration Tools** assist organizations transitioning from other analytics platforms, providing data mapping, implementation guidance, and best practices for platform adoption.

The platform serves multiple user personas including product managers analyzing user behavior, engineers implementing tracking and experiments, data analysts creating insights and reports, marketers optimizing campaigns and user experiences, and executives monitoring key business metrics and growth indicators.

**Academy Content** provides educational resources, training materials, and certification programs to help teams maximize platform value, while **FAQ and Troubleshooting** resources support implementation and operational challenges.

The documentation structure reflects Amplitude's position as an enterprise-grade platform requiring comprehensive technical implementation guidance, from initial instrumentation through advanced experimentation and data activation workflows.
