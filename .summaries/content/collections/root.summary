Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive business growth through data-driven decision making. The platform consists of several interconnected products that work together to collect, analyze, and activate customer data across the entire user journey.

## Core Product Architecture

The Amplitude ecosystem is built around four primary pillars that create a unified data and analytics workflow:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, providing behavioral analysis through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Impact Analysis, Revenue LTV, and Engagement Matrix. Each chart type offers specialized insights into different aspects of user behavior and business performance.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced statistical analysis, supporting both client-side and server-side experimentation workflows. The platform includes experiment theory, advanced techniques, troubleshooting tools, and comprehensive results analysis.

**Amplitude CDP (Customer Data Platform)** manages data collection, audience creation, and activation through Amplitude Sources (data ingestion), Amplitude Activation (personalization engine), and Amplitude Data (export and destination management). The CDP enables conversion lift improvements of 15-30% through integrated data management and audience activation.

**Supporting Products** include Amplitude Session Replay for user experience analysis, Amplitude Guides and Surveys for in-product messaging, and various administrative and data management tools.

## Product Relationships and Integration

The platform operates through a unified data pipeline where Amplitude Sources collects and ingests data from multiple touchpoints, feeding into the Analytics engine for behavioral analysis. This data simultaneously powers Amplitude Experiment for testing hypotheses and Amplitude CDP for audience creation and activation. Session Replay provides qualitative context to quantitative insights, while Guides and Surveys enable direct user feedback collection.

**Data Flow Architecture**: Sources → Analytics/Experiment/CDP → Data Export → External Destinations
**Identity Resolution**: Unified user tracking across products using Amplitude ID, Device ID, and User ID relationships
**Cross-Product Features**: Shared audiences, unified user profiles, and consistent event tracking across all products

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Identity Framework:**
- **Amplitude ID**: Automatically generated unique identifier for each user profile
- **Device ID**: Platform-specific identifier (IDFV for iOS, UUID for web, IDFA/AdID for advertising)
- **User ID**: Application-defined identifier for authenticated users
- **Anonymous User Merging**: Automated process combining pre-authentication and post-authentication user data

**Analytics Terminology:**
- **Events**: User actions tracked within the platform
- **Properties**: Attributes associated with events or users
- **Cohorts**: User segments defined by behavioral or predictive criteria
- **Funnels**: Sequential user journey analysis
- **Retention**: User return behavior measurement
- **Stickiness**: Frequency of user engagement within time periods

**Experimentation Concepts:**
- **Feature Flags**: Boolean toggles controlling feature visibility
- **Variants**: Different versions of features being tested
- **Statistical Significance**: Confidence level in experiment results
- **Lift**: Percentage improvement in key metrics

**Data Management Terms:**
- **Sources**: Data input channels and integrations
- **Destinations**: External platforms receiving data exports
- **Syncs**: Data transfer processes between systems
- **Computations**: Custom metrics and calculations
- **Predictions**: ML-generated behavioral forecasts

## Ecosystem Integration and Positioning

Amplitude integrates extensively with the broader marketing and product technology stack through multiple connection points:
