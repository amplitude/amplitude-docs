Amplitude is a comprehensive behavioral analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP), all supported by extensive SDK libraries, APIs, and third-party integrations.

## Core Product Architecture and Relationships

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational product, providing behavioral event tracking and analysis through multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Personas, Stickiness, Revenue LTV, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Data Tables, and Compass. These charts enable comprehensive user behavior analysis from acquisition through retention and monetization.

**Amplitude Experiment** integrates deeply with the analytics platform to provide feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities. The product includes advanced techniques, experiment theory, workflow management, and troubleshooting components. Experiment Results charts within Analytics provide statistical analysis of experiment performance, creating a closed-loop optimization system.

**Session Replay** captures and analyzes user session recordings to provide qualitative insights that complement quantitative behavioral data from Analytics, enabling deeper understanding of user experience issues and optimization opportunities.

**Guides and Surveys** enables in-product messaging and feedback collection, with data flowing back into Analytics for behavioral analysis of user engagement with guides and survey responses.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation through Sources, Destinations, Audiences, and warehouse-native capabilities, serving as the data foundation for all other Amplitude products.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** represent user actions tracked within applications, forming the fundamental data unit across all Amplitude products. Events contain properties, user identifiers (user_id, device_id), and timestamps that enable behavioral analysis.

**Cohorts** are behavioral user segments created in Analytics that can be exported to external platforms through the CDP or used for experiment targeting in Amplitude Experiment.

**Funnels** analyze conversion rates through sequential user actions, while **Retention** measures user return behavior over time periods.

**Journeys** map user paths through applications, and **Personas** create behavioral user archetypes based on event patterns.

**Feature Flags** in Experiment control feature rollouts and enable A/B testing, with **Variants** representing different user experiences being tested.

**Sources** ingest data from external platforms into Amplitude, while **Destinations** send Amplitude data to external tools for activation.

**Ampli** is Amplitude's type-safe analytics wrapper that ensures consistent event tracking across development teams and platforms.

## SDK and API Ecosystem

The platform provides comprehensive instrumentation through multiple SDK categories:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal implementations, each providing platform-specific event tracking capabilities with consistent APIs for track, identify, screen, alias, and group functions.

**Experiment SDKs** enable feature flag evaluation and experiment participation across the same platform ecosystem, with client-side and server-side evaluation options.

**Ampli** generates type-safe tracking libraries for each supported platform, ensuring data quality and consistency across development workflows.

**APIs** include the Analytics API for server-side event ingestion, Experiment APIs for flag management and evaluation, and Guides and Surveys API for in-product messaging management.

## Data Integration and Activation Architecture

The **Source Catalog** provides over 60 integrations across marketing attribution (AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch), advertising platforms (Facebook Ads, Google Ads), customer data platforms (Segment, mParticle), marketing automation (Braze, HubSpot, Iterable), subscription management (RevenueCat, Stripe), survey platforms (Qualtrics, Sprig), and data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks).

The **Destination Catalog** enables data activation by sending behavioral cohorts and event data to external platforms for marketing automation, personalization, and business intelligence workflows.

**Warehouse-native Amplitude** allows organizations to run Amplitude analytics directly on their data warehouse infrastructure while maintaining the full Amplitude user experience.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** provides organization-level controls, user permissions, and project management capabilities.

**Single Sign-on** enables enterprise authentication integration with SAML and OAuth providers.

**Billing and Use** tracks platform usage across events, MTUs (Monthly Tracked Users), and feature utilization for cost management and optimization.

**PII Integrations** provide privacy-compliant data handling for personally identifiable information across the platform.

## Technical Implementation Patterns

**Route Structure** follows consistent URL patterns:
- `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/{slug}` for analytics features
- `/sdks/{platform}/{slug}` for SDK documentation  
- `/apis/{product}/{slug}` for API references
- `/feature-experiment/{slug}` for experiment features
- `/data/{slug}` for CDP functionality

**Authentication Mechanisms** vary by integration type, including OAuth 2.0, API keys, service accounts, and webhook configurations, with support for both US and EU data residency requirements.

**User Identity Resolution** supports multiple mapping strategies including email fallback, device ID synchronization, and custom identifier matching through amplitudeDeviceId and customerUserId parameters.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates with the broader product analytics and growth stack through standardized APIs and webhook configurations. The platform serves as both a data destination (receiving behavioral data from various sources) and a data source (sending behavioral insights to activation platforms).

The **Attribution API** standardizes marketing attribution data ingestion with 72-hour attribution windows and advertising ID matching for mobile attribution analysis. The **HTTP V2 API** enables real-time server-side event ingestion, while the **Cohorts API** facilitates behavioral segment export for downstream marketing automation and personalization.

**Multi-language Support** includes Japanese localization, indicating global enterprise deployment capabilities.

The platform's architecture enables organizations to create comprehensive customer journey analytics by unifying acquisition data from attribution platforms, engagement metrics from marketing tools, conversion events from subscription systems, satisfaction insights from survey platforms, and optimization data from experimentation tools, all centralized within Amplitude's behavioral analytics platform for unified customer intelligence and decision-making.
