Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and make data-driven decisions through four core products: Analytics, Data, Experiment, and Session Replay.

## Core Product Suite and Architecture

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational product analytics engine with multiple specialized chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Compass, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, Revenue LTV, Data Tables, and Experiment Results. Each chart type provides specific analytical capabilities for understanding different aspects of user behavior and product performance.

**Amplitude Data** functions as the Customer Data Platform (CDP) layer, providing robust data integration capabilities through Sources and Destinations catalogs, Audiences management, and warehouse-native functionality. The platform supports comprehensive data pipeline management with PII integrations and extensive third-party connectivity.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers advanced A/B testing and feature flagging capabilities with sophisticated statistical methodologies including sequential testing, advanced targeting techniques, and comprehensive workflow management. The platform supports both remote and local evaluation modes with extensive SDK coverage.

**Session Replay** provides qualitative user experience analysis by reconstructing complete digital user sessions for debugging and optimization purposes.

## Technical Implementation Framework

The platform operates through multiple integration layers:

**SDK Ecosystem** includes comprehensive coverage across platforms:
- **Analytics SDKs**: Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal implementations
- **Experiment SDKs**: Dedicated experimentation SDKs for feature flagging and A/B testing
- **Ampli**: Type-safe analytics implementation layer
- **Framework Integrations**: Specialized integrations for popular development frameworks

**API Infrastructure** provides programmatic access through:
- **Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/`) for data ingestion and retrieval
- **Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) for experimentation management
- **Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) for in-product messaging

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Collections Structure**: The platform organizes content through hierarchical collections with specific routing patterns. Each collection supports `template`, `layout`, `mount`, `route`, `preview_targets`, and `inject` configurations for content management and navigation.

**Navigation Taxonomy**: Content is organized through navigation titles including `analytics`, `data`, `experiment`, `apis`, `analytics_sdks`, `experiment_sdks`, `charts`, `get_started`, `admin`, `faq`, and specialized categories for different product areas.

**Site Management**: Multi-site support with `sites: [en, jp]` configuration and `propagate` settings for content distribution across locales.

**Content Mounting**: Collections utilize `mount` UUIDs for content relationships and hierarchical organization, enabling complex documentation structures with parent-child relationships.

## Statistical and Experimentation Framework

Amplitude Experiment implements advanced statistical methodologies including **mixture sequential probability ratio test (mSPRT)** for continuous experiment monitoring, **mutual exclusion groups** for preventing user overlap, **holdout groups** for incrementality testing, and **flag dependencies** for complex experiment relationships.

The platform supports **bucketing processes** using deterministic randomization, **exposure tracking** for accurate measurement, and **experiment theory** foundations for rigorous statistical inference.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** (`/admin/account-management/`) provides organizational controls, while **Billing and Use** (`/admin/billing-use/`) handles subscription management. **Single Sign-on** (`/admin/single-sign-on/`) enables enterprise authentication integration.

**Partners** ecosystem (`/partners/`) facilitates third-party integrations and marketplace connectivity.

## Content and Learning Resources

**Academy Content** provides educational materials, while **Guides and Surveys** (`/guides-and-surveys/`) offers in-product messaging capabilities. **FAQ and Troubleshooting** (`/faq/`) sections provide comprehensive support documentation.

**Migration** resources (`/migration/`) assist with platform transitions and implementation guidance.

## Global and Localization Support

The platform supports internationalization through **Japanese Translation** collections with dedicated routing and navigation structures, demonstrating enterprise-grade localization capabilities.

## Route Structure and URL Patterns

The platform employs systematic URL routing:
- Analytics: `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/{slug}`
- Data: `/data/{feature}/{slug}`
- Experiment: `/feature-experiment/{category}/{slug}`
- SDKs: `/sdks/{platform}/{slug}`
- APIs: `/apis/{service}/{slug}`

This comprehensive architecture enables organizations to implement sophisticated product analytics, experimentation, and data management workflows through a unified platform with extensive customization and integration capabilities.
