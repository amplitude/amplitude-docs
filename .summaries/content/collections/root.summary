# Amplitude Documentation Platform

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools for product analytics, feature experimentation, user engagement, and data management. The platform consists of multiple integrated products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Product Architecture and Core Components

The Amplitude ecosystem is structured around several interconnected product areas that work together to provide end-to-end customer analytics and experimentation capabilities:

**Analytics** serves as the foundational product, providing event tracking, user behavior analysis, and data visualization through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, Cohort Analysis (Lifecycle), User Sessions, Journeys, Compass, Data Tables, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, Stickiness, Personas, Revenue LTV, and Experiment Results charts.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers feature flagging, A/B testing, and experimentation capabilities with advanced techniques, statistical theory, workflow management, and troubleshooting tools. The product includes specialized routing under `/feature-experiment/` for core functionality, with dedicated sections for advanced techniques, experiment theory, workflow management, and troubleshooting.

**Session Replay** provides user session recording and analysis capabilities, operating as a standalone product with its own navigation structure and branded as "Amplitude Session Replay."

**Guides and Surveys** enables in-app messaging, user onboarding, and feedback collection, branded as "Amplitude Guides and Surveys" with dedicated API endpoints and SDK integration.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and distribution through source catalogs, destination catalogs, audiences, and warehouse-native capabilities.

## SDK and Integration Framework

Amplitude provides extensive SDK coverage across multiple platforms and programming languages:

**Client-Side SDKs** include Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Unity, and Unreal Engine implementations, all organized under `/sdks/analytics/` routing with dedicated analytics_sdks navigation.

**Server-Side SDKs** encompass Node.js, Python, Java, and Go implementations for backend event tracking and data processing.

**Ampli** serves as a type-safe wrapper system for analytics SDKs, providing code generation and validation capabilities across supported platforms.

**Experiment SDKs** offer specialized feature flagging and experimentation capabilities separate from analytics SDKs, with dedicated routing under `/sdks/experiment-sdks/`.

All SDKs utilize mount points for content organization, enabling modular documentation management and consistent cross-platform implementation patterns.

## API Ecosystem and Authentication

The platform exposes comprehensive APIs across three main product areas:

**Analytics APIs** (`/apis/analytics/`) provide event ingestion, data export, and reporting capabilities with dedicated mount points for organized documentation.

**Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) deliver feature flag management, experiment configuration, and results analysis functionality.

**Guides and Surveys APIs** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) enable programmatic control of user engagement campaigns and feedback collection.

All APIs utilize consistent authentication patterns and organizational structures, with routing organized under the `/apis/` namespace and dedicated navigation injection for seamless documentation browsing.

## Data Management and Integration Capabilities

The CDP component provides robust data management through:

**Source Catalog** offers pre-built integrations for data ingestion from various platforms, with taxonomy-based categorization using `integration_category` classifications and dedicated navigation under `source-catalog`.

**Destination Catalog** enables data distribution to external platforms and tools, similarly organized with integration categories and specialized routing under `/data/destination-catalog/`.

**Audiences** functionality allows for user segmentation and cohort management with routing under `/data/audiences/`.

**Warehouse-Native Amplitude** provides direct data warehouse integration capabilities for organizations preferring to maintain data in their existing infrastructure.

**PII Integrations** handle personally identifiable information with specialized privacy and compliance considerations.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

The platform includes comprehensive administrative capabilities:

**Account Management** provides user administration, permissions, and organizational settings accessible via `/admin/account-management/` routing.

**Single Sign-On (SSO)** enables enterprise authentication integration with dedicated documentation under `/admin/single-sign-on/`.

**Billing and Usage** management tools help organizations monitor consumption and costs through `/admin/billing-use/` interfaces.

All administrative features utilize the `admin` navigation injection for consistent user experience and access control.

## Content Organization and Localization

The documentation platform supports multi-site architecture with English (`en`) and Japanese (`jp`) localization. Japanese content receives specialized treatment with dedicated navigation (`japanese_content`) and modified user experience settings including disabled feedback mechanisms (`hide_helpful: true`).

The content management system employs several organizational patterns:

**Collections** group related content with consistent routing, templating, and navigation injection patterns.

**Mount Points** enable modular content organization using UUID-based identifiers for stable cross-references.

**Propagation Controls** manage content distribution across multiple sites with granular control over localization workflows.

**Date Behavior** implements publication controls with past content marked public and future content remaining private until publication dates.

## Navigation and User Experience Architecture

The platform implements a sophisticated navigation system with context-aware injection:

- `analytics` for core analytics features and chart types
- `experiment` for Amplitude Experiment functionality  
- `data` for CDP and data management features
- `apis` for all API documentation
- `analytics_sdks` and `experiment_sdks` for respective SDK documentation
- `get_started` for onboarding and migration content
- `admin` for administrative functions
- `session_replay` for Session Replay features
- `guides_and_surveys` for user engagement tools

Each navigation context provides specialized user experiences with appropriate feature highlighting and cross-product integration points, enabling users to efficiently navigate the comprehensive platform documentation while maintaining context within their specific product workflows.
