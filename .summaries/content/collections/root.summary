## API Infrastructure

The platform exposes comprehensive APIs for programmatic access:

**Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/`) - Event ingestion, user properties, and behavioral data queries
**Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) - Feature flag management, experiment configuration, and results analysis  
**Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) - In-product messaging and feedback collection

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** - User actions or system occurrences tracked within applications
**Properties** - Attributes associated with events or users for segmentation and analysis
**Cohorts** - User groups defined by shared characteristics or behaviors
**Funnels** - Sequential event paths representing user conversion flows
**Segments** - Filtered subsets of users or events for targeted analysis
**Flags** - Feature toggles controlling functionality exposure in experiments
**Variants** - Different versions of features tested in experiments
**Sample Rate** - Percentage of users included in data collection or experiments
**Session ID** - Unique identifier linking user interactions within a session
**Device ID** - Persistent identifier for cross-session user tracking

**Data Governance Terms:**
- **PII (Personally Identifiable Information)** - Sensitive user data requiring special handling
- **Data Residency** - Geographic location of data storage (US/EU server zones)
- **Masking** - Privacy protection through data obfuscation
- **Consent Management** - User permission tracking for data collection

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** (`/admin/account-management/`) - Organization settings, user permissions, and access control
**Single Sign-On** (`/admin/single-sign-on/`) - Enterprise authentication integration
**Billing and Use** (`/admin/billing-use/`) - Usage monitoring and subscription management

**Data Management:**
