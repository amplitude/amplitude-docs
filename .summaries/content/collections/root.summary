Amplitude is a comprehensive behavioral analytics and experimentation platform that enables businesses to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and activate insights across their technology stack. The platform consists of several interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment (A/B testing and feature management), Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP) with extensive integration capabilities.

## Core Product Architecture and Relationships

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational product, providing behavioral event tracking and analysis through multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Revenue LTV, and Experiment Results. These charts enable deep behavioral analysis across user cohorts and segments.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers feature flagging, A/B testing, and experimentation capabilities with advanced techniques, statistical theory foundations, and comprehensive result analysis. The platform includes workflow management, troubleshooting tools, and "under the hood" technical documentation for implementation teams.

**Session Replay** captures and analyzes user interaction recordings to provide qualitative insights complementing quantitative behavioral data.

**Guides and Surveys** enables in-product messaging, onboarding flows, and user feedback collection through contextual surveys and guided experiences.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** provides data ingestion, transformation, audience creation, and activation through extensive source and destination catalogs supporting over 100 integrations.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** are discrete user actions tracked within applications, containing event_type, event_properties, user_properties, amplitude_id, user_id, and server_upload_time metadata.

**Cohorts** represent behavioral audience segments created from user actions and properties, exportable to downstream platforms for activation and targeting.

**Ampli** is Amplitude's type-safe analytics wrapper that generates strongly-typed tracking libraries for consistent event instrumentation across development teams.

**Feature Flags** enable controlled feature rollouts and experimentation through boolean toggles and variant assignments managed via Amplitude Experiment.

**Instrumentation** refers to the implementation of event tracking code using Amplitude's SDKs across web, mobile, and server-side applications.

**Data Tables** provide SQL-like querying capabilities for behavioral data exploration and custom analysis beyond standard chart types.

**Warehouse-native Amplitude** enables analytics directly on customer data warehouses without data movement, supporting Snowflake, BigQuery, and other cloud platforms.

## SDK and API Ecosystem

Amplitude provides comprehensive SDKs for multiple platforms:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser (JavaScript), Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine implementations for event tracking and user identification.

**Experiment SDKs** deliver feature flag evaluation and variant assignment across client-side and server-side environments with real-time updates and local evaluation capabilities.

**APIs** encompass Analytics API for event ingestion, Experiment APIs for flag management, and Guides and Surveys API for in-product experience control.

The **SDK Catalog** provides standardized implementation patterns, while **Ampli** generates type-safe wrappers ensuring consistent tracking implementation across teams and platforms.

## Data Integration and Activation

**Source Catalog** supports data ingestion from marketing platforms, product tools, customer success systems, and custom applications through direct integrations and ETL partnerships.

**Destination Catalog** enables behavioral data activation across marketing automation (Braze, Customer.io), advertising platforms (Facebook, Google Ads), experimentation tools (Optimizely, LaunchDarkly), and data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery).

**Audiences** functionality creates behavioral segments exportable to downstream platforms for personalized messaging, targeted advertising, and experiment audience creation.

**PII Integrations** provide privacy-compliant data handling with hashing, tokenization, and selective data forwarding capabilities.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** includes user provisioning, role-based access controls, and organization-level settings management.

**Single Sign-On (SSO)** supports SAML and OAuth integrations with enterprise identity providers for centralized authentication.

**Billing and Use** provides usage monitoring, plan management, and cost optimization tools for enterprise deployments.

The platform includes comprehensive **FAQ and Troubleshooting** resources, **Migration** guides for platform transitions, and **Academy Content** for user education and best practices.

## Technical Implementation

Route structures follow RESTful patterns with endpoints like `/analytics/{slug}`, `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/{slug}`, `/apis/{product}/{slug}`, and `/feature-experiment/{slug}` for organized documentation and API access.

The platform supports multi-site deployment with English and Japanese localization, content propagation controls, and preview functionality for documentation management.

**Legacy Charts** maintain backward compatibility while new chart types provide enhanced analytical capabilities and improved user experiences.

**Partners** ecosystem includes technology integrations, consulting services, and implementation support for enterprise deployments.

The platform's architecture enables seamless data flow from instrumentation through analysis to activation, positioning Amplitude as a comprehensive behavioral analytics platform that bridges quantitative insights with operational business systems across marketing, product, and customer success functions.
