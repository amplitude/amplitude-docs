Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform centers around event-based analytics, providing sophisticated tools for tracking user interactions, analyzing conversion funnels, running A/B tests, and managing feature rollouts across web and mobile applications.

## Core Product Architecture and Relationships

Amplitude's ecosystem consists of several interconnected products that work together to provide end-to-end analytics capabilities:

**Analytics Core** serves as the foundation, built around event-based tracking with multiple specialized chart types including Event Segmentation for behavioral analysis, Funnel Analysis for conversion tracking, Retention Analysis for user return patterns, User Sessions for session-based metrics, and advanced visualizations like Journeys for user path analysis and Personas for behavioral clustering using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization algorithms.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides comprehensive A/B testing and feature flagging capabilities with sequential testing methodology, mutual exclusion groups, and sophisticated targeting through both remote and local evaluation modes. The platform supports advanced statistical methods with always-valid p-values and duration estimates using statistical modeling.

**Amplitude Data** functions as the governance layer, managing tracking plans, event schemas, and data quality through comprehensive APIs and validation systems. It enforces limits of 2000 event types and properties per project while providing data control options to hide, block, or delete events.

**Session Replay** captures user interactions for qualitative analysis, integrating with analytics charts to provide context for quantitative insights.

**Guides and Surveys** enables in-product messaging and feedback collection, supporting user engagement and research workflows.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Data Model:**
- **Events**: Discrete user actions tracked with timestamps and associated metadata
- **Event Properties**: Attributes describing specific event instances
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes associated with individual user profiles  
- **Group Properties**: Account-level attributes for B2B analytics via the Accounts add-on
- **Amplitude ID**: Platform-generated unique identifier for user tracking
- **Device ID**: Platform-specific identifiers (Android UUID, iOS IDFV/IDFA)
- **Session ID**: Configurable session tracking with timeout windows

**Analytics Concepts:**
- **Behavioral Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments based on actions and properties
- **Conversion Windows**: Time periods for tracking user progression through funnels
- **Attribution Models**: Methods for crediting marketing channels and touchpoints
- **Sequential Testing**: Statistical methodology for experiment analysis with always-valid inference
- **Mutual Exclusion Groups**: Preventing users from being assigned to multiple conflicting experiments

**Technical Infrastructure:**
- **HTTP V2 API**: Primary event ingestion endpoint with real-time processing
- **Batch API**: Bulk data processing for high-volume scenarios
- **Export API**: Historical data extraction in JSON format
- **Identify API**: User property management without event tracking
- **Group Identify API**: Account-level property management

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates extensively with external platforms and internal tools:

**SDK Ecosystem** provides comprehensive coverage across platforms including Browser SDK (JavaScript/TypeScript), mobile SDKs (Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal), server-side SDKs (Node.js, Python, Java, Go, PHP, Ruby), and the Ampli code generation system for type-safe tracking implementations.

**Experiment SDKs** mirror the analytics SDK coverage, providing feature flagging capabilities across all major platforms with consistent APIs for remote and local evaluation modes, plus an Evaluation Proxy for platforms without native SDK support.

**Third-Party Integrations** include comprehensive destination catalogs for data forwarding, source catalogs for data ingestion, mobile attribution partners (Appsflyer, Adjust, Branch), and collaboration tools (Slack, Notion, Confluence, Jira).

**Data Infrastructure** supports multiple data residency options (US/EU), warehouse integrations (Snowflake, Redshift), and privacy compliance frameworks (GDPR, CCPA, SOC2 Type 2, HIPAA).

## Advanced Features and Capabilities

**Statistical Analysis** includes sophisticated measurement options like rolling averages, cumulative sums, custom formulas with 20+ formula types, HyperLogLog algorithms for efficient unique user calculations, and real-time processing with 5-minute cache intervals.

**Experimentation Features** provide advanced targeting through cohort syncing, account-level bucketing, bootstrapping for reduced load times, and comprehensive provider interfaces for analytics integration and user management.

**Data Governance** encompasses taxonomy management, event schema validation, data transformation capabilities, bot filtering, and comprehensive privacy controls including programmatic data deletion and CCPA/GDPR compliance tools.

**Collaboration Tools** include Spaces for team organization, dashboard creation and sharing, external embedding with password protection, automated reporting via email and Slack, and extensive commenting and annotation systems.

The platform serves organizations from startups to enterprises, with plan-based feature distribution ranging from basic analytics in Starter plans to advanced experimentation, governance, and collaboration features in Growth and Enterprise tiers. Amplitude's architecture emphasizes immutable data storage, real-time processing capabilities, and comprehensive integration options that enable it to serve as the central analytics hub within broader organizational data and product development workflows.
