Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven decision making. The platform consists of several interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Core Product Architecture

The platform is built around **Amplitude Analytics** as the foundational product, providing event tracking, user segmentation, and behavioral analysis capabilities. **Amplitude Experiment** enables feature flagging and A/B testing functionality. **Session Replay** offers user session recording and analysis. **Guides and Surveys** provides in-product messaging and feedback collection. The **CDP** handles data ingestion, transformation, and routing to downstream systems.

The architecture supports multi-site deployment with English (`en`) and Japanese (`jp`) localization, indicating global market presence. Content propagation controls and site-specific configurations enable localized documentation and feature availability.

## Analytics and Charting Ecosystem

Amplitude Analytics provides an extensive suite of visualization and analysis tools organized into distinct chart types:

**Core Analysis Charts**: Event Segmentation for analyzing user actions and properties, Funnel Analysis for conversion tracking, Retention Analysis for user return behavior, and User Sessions for session-based metrics.

**Advanced Analytics**: Compass for metric monitoring and alerting, Journeys for user path analysis, Impact Analysis for measuring feature effects, Lifecycle charts for user state transitions, Personas for behavioral clustering, and Stickiness analysis for engagement measurement.

**Revenue Analytics**: Revenue LTV charts for customer lifetime value analysis and Data Tables for flexible data exploration and reporting.

**Specialized Tools**: Engagement Matrix for cross-feature usage analysis and Legacy Charts for backward compatibility with older visualization formats.

## SDK and Integration Framework

The platform provides comprehensive SDK coverage across multiple programming languages and platforms:

**Client-Side SDKs**: Browser SDK for web applications, Android SDK for native Android apps, iOS SDK for native iOS development, React Native SDK for cross-platform mobile development, Flutter SDK for Flutter applications, and Unity/Unreal SDKs for game development.

**Server-Side SDKs**: Node.js SDK for JavaScript backend services, Python SDK for Python applications, Java SDK for Java-based systems, and Go SDK for Go applications.

**Specialized Tools**: Ampli provides type-safe analytics implementation with code generation capabilities, ensuring consistent event tracking across development teams.

## API Infrastructure

The platform exposes multiple API surfaces for different product areas:

**Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/{slug}`) provides programmatic access to event data, user properties, and chart results. **Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/{slug}`) enable feature flag management and experiment configuration. **Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/{slug}`) supports in-product messaging automation.

## Data Management and CDP Capabilities

The **Customer Data Platform** handles data ingestion, transformation, and activation across the ecosystem. **Source Catalog** provides pre-built integrations for data collection from various platforms and services. **Destination Catalog** enables data forwarding to downstream tools and systems with integration categorization and filtering.

**Audiences** functionality allows creation of user segments based on behavioral criteria, with real-time updates and cross-platform activation. **Warehouse-native Amplitude** supports direct querying of data warehouse tables for analysis.

**PII Integrations** provide specialized handling of personally identifiable information with compliance and privacy controls.

## Experimentation and Feature Management

**Amplitude Experiment** provides comprehensive A/B testing and feature flagging capabilities with multiple SDK options for different platforms. The system includes **Advanced Techniques** for sophisticated experimental design, **Experiment Theory** for statistical methodology, and **Under the Hood** technical implementation details.

**Workflow** management enables experiment lifecycle tracking from hypothesis to results analysis. **Experiment Results** charts provide specialized visualization for experimental data analysis. **Experiment Troubleshooting** offers debugging and optimization guidance.

**Web Experiment** provides browser-based experimentation tools for front-end optimization without requiring code deployment.

## Administrative and Governance Features

**Account Management** provides organization-level controls and user administration. **Billing and Use** tracking enables usage monitoring and cost management. **Single Sign-on** integration supports enterprise authentication systems.

The platform includes comprehensive **FAQ and Troubleshooting** resources, **Migration** guides for platform transitions, and **Academy Content** for user education and certification.

## Developer Experience and Support

**Get Started** documentation provides onboarding guidance and quick-start tutorials. **Instrumentation** guides cover implementation best practices and SDK integration patterns. **Partners** ecosystem enables third-party integrations and marketplace extensions.

The platform supports **Japanese Translation** with dedicated localization infrastructure, indicating strong international market focus.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** represent user actions tracked within applications. **Properties** are attributes associated with events or users. **Segments** are filtered subsets of users based on behavioral or demographic criteria. **Cohorts** are saved user segments that can be reused across analyses.

**Funnels** track multi-step conversion processes. **Retention** measures user return behavior over time. **LTV** (Lifetime Value) calculates long-term user value. **Stickiness** measures engagement frequency within time periods.

**Feature Flags** control feature availability and rollout. **Variants** represent different experimental conditions. **Allocation** determines user assignment to experimental groups.

## Technical Infrastructure

The platform uses **mount** identifiers (UUIDs) for content organization and routing. **Preview targets** enable content validation before publication. **Date behavior** controls content visibility based on publication timing.

**Navigation injection** (`nav_title`) provides consistent site navigation structure. **Blade** identifiers associate content with specific product areas. **Structure** controls hierarchical content organization with root-level and nested configurations.

Route patterns follow RESTful conventions with dynamic slug-based URLs for content organization and SEO optimization. The system supports both flat and hierarchical content structures with flexible routing configurations.
