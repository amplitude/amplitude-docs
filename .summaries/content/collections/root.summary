## Amplitude Analytics Platform

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools for product analytics, feature experimentation, customer data management, and user behavior analysis. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP), all designed to help teams understand user behavior and optimize product experiences.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem is structured around several core product areas that work together to provide end-to-end analytics and experimentation capabilities:

**Analytics Core**: The foundational analytics platform provides comprehensive charting and analysis capabilities through specialized chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Compass, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Revenue LTV, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Data Tables, and Experiment Results. Each chart type serves specific analytical use cases and can be combined to create comprehensive dashboards and insights.

**Experimentation Platform**: Amplitude Experiment enables feature flagging, A/B testing, and advanced experimentation workflows. The platform includes experiment theory, advanced techniques, workflow management, and comprehensive result analysis. It integrates deeply with the analytics platform to provide unified measurement and analysis of experiment outcomes.

**Data Infrastructure**: The Customer Data Platform (CDP) manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation through Sources, Destinations, Audiences, and warehouse-native capabilities. The platform supports extensive integration catalogs for both data sources and destinations, enabling organizations to centralize their customer data operations.

**Developer Tools**: Comprehensive SDK coverage across platforms (Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, Unreal) with both analytics and experiment SDKs. The Ampli code generation tool provides type-safe analytics implementation, while extensive APIs enable programmatic access to platform capabilities.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Analytics Concepts**:
- **Events**: User actions tracked within applications (clicks, page views, purchases)
- **Properties**: Attributes associated with events (user properties, event properties)
- **Segments**: Filtered subsets of users or events for analysis
- **Cohorts**: Groups of users defined by shared characteristics or behaviors
- **Funnels**: Sequential analysis of user progression through defined steps
- **Retention**: Analysis of user return behavior over time periods

**Experimentation Terminology**:
- **Feature Flags**: Boolean toggles that control feature availability
- **Variants**: Different versions of features being tested in experiments
- **Allocation**: Distribution of users across experiment variants
- **Statistical Significance**: Confidence level in experiment results
- **Lift**: Percentage improvement in key metrics from experiments

**Data Management**:
- **Sources**: Systems that send data into Amplitude (SDKs, APIs, third-party integrations)
- **Destinations**: External systems that receive data from Amplitude
- **Transformations**: Data processing rules applied during ingestion
- **Schemas**: Data structure definitions for events and properties
- **Governance**: Data quality and compliance management tools

**Platform Infrastructure**:
- **Organizations**: Top-level account containers
- **Projects**: Individual product or application tracking containers
- **Environments**: Separate instances for development, staging, production
- **API Keys**: Authentication credentials for SDK and API access

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates extensively with the modern data and product development stack:

**Analytics Integration**: The platform connects with business intelligence tools, data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift), and marketing platforms to provide unified customer insights. The warehouse-native capabilities enable organizations to analyze Amplitude data directly within their existing data infrastructure.

**Development Workflow**: SDKs integrate with popular development frameworks and deployment pipelines. The Ampli code generation tool creates type-safe tracking libraries that integrate with existing codebases, while experiment SDKs enable feature flag management within application logic.

**Marketing and Growth**: Destination integrations enable audience activation across advertising platforms, email marketing tools, and customer engagement platforms. The Guides and Surveys product provides in-app messaging and feedback collection capabilities.

**Data Governance**: PII integrations and privacy controls ensure compliance with regulations like GDPR and CCPA. The platform provides data governance tools for managing data quality, schema validation, and access controls.

## API Endpoints and Integration Points

**Analytics APIs**:
- `/api/2/events`: Event ingestion endpoint for custom data collection
- `/api/2/export`: Raw event data export for custom analysis
- `/api/3/chart`: Programmatic chart data retrieval
