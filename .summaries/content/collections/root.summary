# Amplitude Product Ecosystem

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that helps companies understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and make data-driven decisions. The platform consists of several interconnected products and features organized into collections that address different aspects of the analytics and experimentation workflow.

Key capabilities include:
- Analytics and visualization through various chart types
- Experimentation and feature flagging
- Data management and integration
- SDK implementations across multiple platforms
- API access for programmatic control

## Product Relationships and Structure

The Amplitude ecosystem is organized into several major product areas:

### Analytics
The core analytics platform includes various visualization and analysis tools:
- Charts (Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Event Segmentation)
- Journeys for user path analysis
- Personas for user segmentation
- Impact Analysis for measuring feature effects
- Compass for product discovery
- Session Replay for direct user experience observation

### Experiment
A comprehensive experimentation and feature flagging platform:
- Web experiments
- Client and server-side experimentation
- Feature flags and rollouts
- Advanced techniques and theory
- Workflow management for experiment lifecycle
- Integration with analytics for results analysis

### Data Management
Tools for data collection, organization, and governance:
- Sources for data ingestion
- Source Catalog for integration options
- Audiences for user segmentation
- Destination Catalog for data export
- PII Integrations for sensitive data handling
- CDP (Customer Data Platform) capabilities

### SDKs and Implementation
Multiple SDK implementations across platforms:
- Browser SDK
- iOS SDK
- Android SDK
- React Native SDK
- Flutter SDK
- Unity SDK
- Unreal SDK
- Node.js SDK
- Python SDK
- Java SDK
- Go SDK
- Ampli (code generation layer)

### Administration
Administrative tools for platform management:
- Account Management
- Billing and Usage
- Single Sign-On configuration

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Charts**: Visualization tools for analyzing user behavior patterns
- **Funnel Analysis**: Tracking user progression through defined sequences
- **Retention Analysis**: Measuring how users return to a product over time
- **Event Segmentation**: Breaking down user actions by properties
- **Journeys**: Visualizing user paths through a product
- **Experiment**: A controlled test comparing variants of a feature
- **Feature Flag**: Configuration toggle for enabling/disabling features
- **Variant**: A specific version of a feature being tested
- **SDK (Software Development Kit)**: Libraries for implementing Amplitude in applications
- **Ampli**: Code generation layer that provides type-safe tracking
- **Source**: Data input connection for bringing data into Amplitude
- **Destination**: Data output connection for exporting data from Amplitude
- **Audience**: Defined segment of users based on behaviors or properties
- **CDP**: Customer Data Platform for unified user data management

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The collections demonstrate how Amplitude's products integrate with each other:

1. **Analytics and Experiment**: Experiment results are analyzed using Analytics charts, with specific chart types designed for experiment analysis.

2. **Data Flow Architecture**:
   - Sources → Amplitude Platform → Destinations
   - SDKs → Analytics → Experiment → Charts/Visualization

3. **Cross-Platform Implementation**: SDKs across web, mobile, and server environments ensure consistent data collection and experiment delivery.

4. **Admin and Management Layer**: Account management, billing, and SSO provide organizational control over the platform.

## Technical Implementation

### API Endpoints and SDK Methods

The documentation includes various SDK implementations with platform-specific methods:

- SDK initialization patterns:
  ```javascript
  // Browser SDK example
  amplitude.init(API_KEY, {
    // Configuration options
  });
  ```

- Event tracking:
  ```javascript
  amplitude.track('Event Name', {
    // Event properties
  });
  ```

- User identification:
  ```javascript
  amplitude.setUserId('user_id');
  amplitude.setUserProperties({
    // User properties
  });
  ```

- Experiment variant retrieval:
  ```javascript
  const variant = experiment.variant('experiment-key', userContext);
  ```

### Routing Structure

The documentation follows a consistent URL structure:

- `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/{slug}` for analytics visualizations
- `/sdks/{platform}/{slug}` for SDK documentation
- `/apis/{product}/{slug}` for API documentation
- `/data/{feature}/{slug}` for data management features
- `/feature-experiment/{section}/{slug}` for experimentation features
- `/admin/{feature}/{slug}` for administrative functions

This structured approach to documentation reflects the organization of the product itself, with clear separation between different functional areas while maintaining integration points between them.
