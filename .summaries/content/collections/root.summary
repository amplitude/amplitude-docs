Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of several interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Core Product Architecture

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, offering multiple chart types for data visualization and analysis. The analytics suite includes Event Segmentation for tracking user actions, Funnel Analysis for conversion optimization, Retention Analysis for user engagement measurement, Cohort Analysis through Lifecycle charts, User Journey mapping through Journeys charts, Revenue LTV analysis, Engagement Matrix for behavioral patterns, Impact Analysis for feature assessment, Stickiness analysis for product engagement, User Sessions analysis, Personas for user segmentation, Data Tables for raw data exploration, and Compass for metric monitoring.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced statistical analysis. The platform supports experiment design, variant management, statistical significance testing, and results analysis through dedicated experiment results charts. It includes sophisticated targeting capabilities, rollout management, and integration with the broader Amplitude ecosystem.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user sessions to provide qualitative insights into user behavior, complementing the quantitative analytics data.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user experience optimization through contextual guidance and feedback collection, supporting multiple form factors including modals, popovers, tooltips, banners, and checklists.

## Data Infrastructure and Integration

The **Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation across the ecosystem. It includes comprehensive source and destination catalogs for third-party integrations, audience management capabilities, and data governance features. The platform supports warehouse-native implementations for organizations preferring to maintain data in their existing infrastructure.

**Sources** handle data ingestion from various platforms and applications, while **Destinations** enable data activation to downstream tools and platforms. The **Audience** functionality allows for sophisticated user segmentation and targeting across products.

## SDK and API Ecosystem

Amplitude provides extensive **Software Development Kits (SDKs)** across multiple platforms and languages:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser SDK for web applications, Android SDK for mobile apps, iOS SDK for Apple platforms, React Native SDK for cross-platform mobile development, Flutter SDK for multi-platform applications, Node.js SDK for server-side implementation, Python SDK for backend services, Java SDK for enterprise applications, Go SDK for modern backend systems, Unity SDK for game development, and Unreal SDK for advanced gaming applications.

**Experiment SDKs** provide feature flagging and experimentation capabilities across the same platform ecosystem, ensuring consistent implementation patterns and functionality.

**Ampli** serves as a type-safe wrapper around Amplitude SDKs, providing compile-time validation and improved developer experience through code generation and schema enforcement.

## API Infrastructure

The platform exposes comprehensive **APIs** for programmatic access:

**Analytics API** enables data ingestion, event tracking, and analytics data retrieval with endpoints for event submission, user property management, and query execution.

**Experiment APIs** provide programmatic control over feature flags, experiment configuration, and variant assignment with real-time flag evaluation and user targeting.

**Guides and Surveys API** allows for programmatic management of in-product experiences, content delivery, and response collection.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** represent user actions or system occurrences tracked within applications, forming the foundation of all analytics and experimentation.

**Properties** are attributes associated with events or users, providing context and enabling segmentation and analysis.

**Cohorts** are user segments defined by shared characteristics or behaviors, used for targeting and analysis across products.

**Funnels** represent sequential user journeys through defined steps, enabling conversion analysis and optimization.

**Experiments** are controlled tests comparing different product variations to measure impact on key metrics.

**Feature Flags** are toggles that control feature availability and behavior, enabling gradual rollouts and experimentation.

**Variants** are different versions of features or experiences tested within experiments.

**Targeting** refers to the rules and criteria used to determine which users see specific features or experiments.

**Instrumentation** is the process of implementing tracking code to capture user interactions and system events.

## Administrative and Management Features

**Account Management** provides organizational controls, user management, and access permissions across the platform.

**Billing and Use** tracks platform usage, manages subscription limits, and provides cost optimization insights.

**Single Sign-On (SSO)** enables enterprise authentication integration with identity providers.

The platform implements sophisticated **Permission Systems** with role-based access control, allowing organizations to manage user access across different products and features.

## Advanced Capabilities

**Advanced Techniques** in experimentation include statistical methodologies, power analysis, sequential testing, and advanced targeting strategies.

**Experiment Theory** covers statistical foundations, hypothesis testing, significance calculations, and best practices for experimental design.

**Under the Hood** documentation explains the technical implementation details, algorithms, and architectural decisions underlying the platform's functionality.

**Migration** tools and documentation support transitions from other analytics platforms, ensuring data continuity and minimal disruption.

## Developer Resources and Support

The platform provides extensive **FAQ and Troubleshooting** resources, covering common implementation challenges, debugging techniques, and best practices.

**Academy Content** offers educational materials, training resources, and certification programs for platform users.

**Partners** integration supports third-party tools and services, extending platform capabilities through ecosystem partnerships.

**Legacy Charts** maintain backward compatibility for deprecated visualization types while encouraging migration to newer alternatives.

The platform supports multiple deployment models including cloud-hosted solutions and **Warehouse-native Amplitude** for organizations preferring to maintain data within their existing infrastructure while leveraging Amplitude's analytics capabilities.
