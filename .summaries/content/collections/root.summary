Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics platform that provides organizations with advanced user behavior tracking, experimentation capabilities, and data management tools across web and mobile applications.

## Core Product Architecture

Amplitude operates as an integrated analytics ecosystem built around three primary product lines: **Amplitude Analytics** for behavioral analytics, **Amplitude Experiment** for feature flagging and A/B testing, and **Amplitude CDP** (Customer Data Platform) for data management and activation. The platform supports multi-site deployments with English and Japanese localization, indicating global enterprise adoption.

The system processes data through multiple ingestion pathways including HTTP V2 API, Batch API, and Identify API, supported by comprehensive SDK coverage across platforms (Android, iOS, Browser, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal, Node.js, Python, Java, Go). Data flows through real-time pipelines with built-in validation, debugging capabilities, and privacy controls.

## Product Features and Relationships

**Analytics Foundation**: The platform centers on Event Segmentation as the primary analysis tool, complemented by specialized chart types including Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys (user path analysis), and advanced visualizations like Engagement Matrix, Lifecycle, Personas, Stickiness, and Revenue LTV. These charts integrate with behavioral cohorts for dynamic user segmentation and support machine learning-powered anomaly detection using Prophet algorithms.

**Experimentation Platform**: Amplitude Experiment provides feature flag management, A/B testing infrastructure, and statistical analysis through dedicated SDKs and APIs. The platform includes advanced techniques for experiment design, statistical theory documentation, and comprehensive results analysis integrated with the analytics charts ecosystem.

**Data Management**: The CDP component manages data sources, destinations, and audiences with extensive integration catalogs. The platform supports warehouse-native architectures, PII management, and real-time data activation across marketing and product tools.

**Session Intelligence**: Session Replay captures user interactions through DOM reconstruction and provides heatmap analysis (click maps, selector maps, scroll maps) with configurable privacy masking and GDPR compliance features.

**Collaboration Tools**: The platform includes Spaces for team organization, Dashboards for metric aggregation, Notebooks for analytical storytelling, and native integrations with Slack, Confluence, Jira, Notion, Miro, and Google Workspace.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Data Model**:
- **Events**: User actions with associated event properties for contextual information
- **Users**: Individual actors with user properties describing characteristics
- **Groups**: Account-level entities enabling B2B analytics with up to 5 group types per project
- **Sessions**: Periods of user activity with configurable timeout parameters

**Analytics Concepts**:
- **Cohorts**: Behavioral (dynamic based on actions) and Static (predefined user lists) groupings
- **Historical Count**: Tracking Nth instance (up to 5th) of user actions with one-year lookback
- **Attribution Models**: First-touch and last-touch marketing attribution with configurable windows
- **Amplitude Data**: Tracking plan management with schema validation

**Experimentation Terms**:
- **Feature Flags**: Boolean controls for feature rollouts and targeting
- **Variants**: Different versions in A/B tests with statistical significance tracking
- **Remote Config**: Dynamic configuration management without code deployment

**Privacy and Governance**:
- **Masking Levels**: Conservative, Light, Medium privacy controls for session replay
- **Consent Management**: CMP integration for GDPR compliance
- **Data Residency**: EU server zone options for regional compliance

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates extensively with marketing technology through UTM parameter tracking, channel classification, and out-of-the-box marketing metrics (CAC, ROAS, CTR, CPC). The platform supports development workflows through semantic versioning in Releases tracking, feature flag integration, and comprehensive A/B testing capabilities.

Enterprise features include single sign-on (SSO), account management, billing controls, and administrative functions. The platform provides domain proxy configurations for custom routing, BAA compliance options, and comprehensive data governance controls.

**Guides and Surveys**: A dedicated product for in-app messaging and user feedback collection with its own API and SDK integrations.

**Partners Ecosystem**: Extensive third-party integrations through source and destination catalogs, supporting data ingestion from marketing tools, databases, and customer platforms, plus activation to advertising, email, and business intelligence tools.

## API Endpoints and Technical Integration

**Primary APIs**:
- `/apis/analytics/{slug}` - Analytics API for data querying and chart access
- `/apis/experiment/{slug}` - Experiment APIs for flag management and variant assignment
- `/apis/guides-and-surveys/{slug}` - In-app messaging and survey APIs
- HTTP V2 API (api2.amplitude.com) - Primary event ingestion endpoint
- Batch API - Bulk event processing for high-volume scenarios
- Group Identify API - Account-level property management with operations ($set, $setOnce, $add, $append, $unset)

**SDK Integration Patterns**:
- Plugin architecture for modern SDKs
- Middleware patterns for legacy SDK support
- Standalone implementations for third-party analytics integration
- Wrapper integrations for Segment, Rudderstack, and Google Tag Manager

**Technical Configuration**:
- Domain proxy support with NGINX configuration examples
- Multi-environment deployment with staging/production separation
- Real-time debugging through Ingestion Debugger and Chrome extensions
- Remote configuration for dynamic feature and privacy controls

The platform serves as a comprehensive analytics and experimentation solution for product teams, marketers, and data scientists, providing both technical depth and business intelligence capabilities across the entire user lifecycle.
