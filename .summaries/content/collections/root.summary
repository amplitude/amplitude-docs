# Amplitude Product Ecosystem

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and customer data platform that helps businesses understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven decisions. The platform consists of several interconnected products and features that collectively enable organizations to collect, analyze, and activate user data.

Key products in the Amplitude ecosystem include:

1. **Analytics** - Core analytics platform for tracking user behavior and generating insights
2. **Experiment** - Feature experimentation and A/B testing platform
3. **CDP (Customer Data Platform)** - Data management and integration capabilities
4. **Amplitude Data** - Data collection, processing, and management tools
5. **SDKs** - Client and server libraries for various platforms to instrument applications

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Amplitude ecosystem is organized into several interconnected components:

### Data Collection Layer
- **SDKs** (Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal, Node.js, Python, Java, Go)
- **Ampli** - Code generation tool for type-safe instrumentation
- **Source Catalog** - Integrations to import data from external sources

### Data Processing Layer
- **Data Management** - Tools for data governance, identity resolution, and quality
- **PII Integrations** - Handling of personally identifiable information
- **Warehouse-Native Amplitude** - Direct data warehouse integration capabilities

### Analytics Layer
- **Charts** - Various visualization tools (Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, Event Segmentation, etc.)
- **Journeys** - User journey mapping and analysis
- **Compass** - Product analytics guidance
- **Session Replay** - Visual recording of user sessions

### Activation Layer
- **Destination Catalog** - Integrations to export data to external platforms
- **Audiences** - User segmentation capabilities
- **Cohort Sync** - Exporting user segments to marketing platforms

### Experimentation Layer
- **Experiment** - A/B testing and feature flagging
- **Impact Analysis** - Measuring experiment outcomes
- **Experiment SDKs** - Client libraries for implementing experiments

### Administration Layer
- **Account Management** - User and organization settings
- **Billing and Use** - Subscription and usage tracking
- **Single Sign-On** - Authentication integrations

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Data Concepts
- **Event** - A discrete user action or system occurrence tracked in Amplitude
- **User Property** - Attributes associated with a user
- **Cohort** - A group of users who share common behaviors or attributes
- **User ID** - Primary identifier for a user in Amplitude
- **Device ID** - Identifier for a specific device or browser
- **Merged User** - Records that track when multiple user IDs belong to the same user

### Analytics Concepts
- **Funnel Analysis** - Tracking user progression through a sequence of events
- **Retention Analysis** - Measuring how users continue to engage over time
- **Event Segmentation** - Breaking down events by user properties or behaviors
- **Lifecycle** - Analysis of new, returning, and churned users
- **Stickiness** - Measuring frequency of user engagement
- **Personas** - User archetypes based on behavior patterns

### Experimentation Concepts
- **Experiment** - A controlled test comparing variations of a feature
- **Variant** - A specific version of a feature being tested
- **Exposure Event** - Record of a user being assigned to an experiment variant
- **Conversion Event** - The target action being optimized in an experiment
- **Significance** - Statistical confidence in experiment results

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude platform is designed as an integrated ecosystem where data flows between components:

1. **Data Collection** → **Analytics** → **Activation**
   - User behavior is tracked via SDKs, analyzed in Analytics, and then used to create segments that are exported to marketing platforms

2. **Analytics** → **Experiment** → **Analytics**
   - Insights from Analytics inform experiment design, experiments are run, and results are analyzed back in Analytics

3. **Data** → **CDP** → **Destination Catalog**
   - Raw data is processed in the CDP, enriched with identity resolution, and then made available for export

4. **Charts** → **Audiences** → **Cohort Sync**
   - Analysis in charts identifies valuable user segments, which are saved as audiences and then synced to external platforms

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

### Analytics API
- Base URL: `/apis/analytics/`
- Key endpoints for querying analytics data and managing resources

### Experiment API
- Base URL: `/apis/experiment/`
- Endpoints for managing experiments, variants, and analyzing results

### SDK Implementation Patterns
- Browser SDK: JavaScript snippet for web applications
- Mobile SDKs: Native libraries for iOS and Android
- Server SDKs: Libraries for backend instrumentation

### Cohort Sync API
```
POST /api/2/cohorts/sync
{
  "destination_id": "destination_id",
  "cohort_id": "cohort_id",
  "sync_type": "one_time|scheduled"
}
```

### Event Tracking Pattern
```
amplitude.track('Event Name', {
  property1: 'value1',
  property2: 'value2'
});
```

The Amplitude platform provides a comprehensive solution for product analytics, experimentation, and data activation, enabling organizations to build better product experiences through data-driven decision making.
