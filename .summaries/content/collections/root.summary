Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with deep insights into user behavior, product performance, and business outcomes through integrated analytics, experimentation, and data management capabilities.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Amplitude platform consists of four primary product suites that work together to provide end-to-end analytics and optimization capabilities:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the core behavioral analytics engine, featuring multiple specialized chart types for different analytical use cases. Event Segmentation provides foundational user behavior analysis, while Funnel Analysis tracks conversion paths and drop-off points. Retention Analysis measures user engagement over time, complemented by Lifecycle charts for cohort analysis and Stickiness measurements for usage frequency patterns. Advanced visualization includes Journeys for path analysis, User Sessions for session-based insights, Personas for user clustering, and specialized charts like Compass for metric relationships, Impact Analysis for statistical significance testing, and Revenue LTV for monetization analysis.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers comprehensive A/B testing and feature flagging capabilities through integrated experimentation workflows. The platform includes advanced statistical analysis through Experiment Results charts, sophisticated targeting through Advanced Techniques, and robust Experiment Theory foundations. The system supports both feature experimentation and web-based testing through dedicated Web Experiment functionality.

**Amplitude Session Replay** provides qualitative user experience analysis by capturing and replaying actual user sessions, enabling teams to understand the "why" behind quantitative analytics data.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user engagement through targeted messaging, onboarding flows, and feedback collection mechanisms.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Event Segmentation**: Core analytical methodology measuring user behavior through event occurrence patterns, supporting both Uniques (distinct user counts) and Event Totals (aggregate event occurrences).

**Custom Formulas**: Advanced analytical language supporting 20+ formula types including ROLLAVG (rolling averages), CUMSUM (cumulative sums), ARPAU (Average Revenue Per Active User), and PERCENTILE calculations for sophisticated behavioral modeling.

**In-line Custom Events**: Temporary event combinations using OR logic for flexible analysis without permanent configuration, currently in closed beta with some integration limitations.

**Ampli**: Type-safe analytics implementation tool that generates strongly-typed tracking libraries, ensuring data quality and consistency across development teams and platforms.

**CDP (Customer Data Platform)**: Comprehensive data management system including Sources for data ingestion, Destinations for data activation, Audiences for user segmentation, and Warehouse-native capabilities for direct data warehouse analysis.

**Microscope**: Deep-dive analysis tool enabling detailed user journey examination and granular behavioral investigation.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude operates as an integrated platform where components share data infrastructure and analytical capabilities:

**Cross-Product Data Flow**: Analytics data feeds directly into Experiment for sophisticated targeting and analysis, while Session Replay provides qualitative context for quantitative Analytics insights. Guides and Surveys leverage Analytics segmentation for precise user targeting.

**Unified Data Architecture**: The CDP serves as the central data hub, with Sources collecting data from multiple touchpoints, Destinations activating insights across marketing and product tools, and Audiences providing consistent segmentation across all product modules.

**Development Integration**: Comprehensive SDK support across platforms (Android, iOS, Browser, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal, Node.js, Python, Java, Go) with Ampli providing type-safe implementation and consistent data collection standards.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

The platform provides extensive API coverage across all product areas:

**Analytics APIs** (`/apis/analytics/`) support programmatic chart creation, data export, and custom dashboard development.

**Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) enable automated experiment management, flag configuration, and results analysis integration.

**Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) facilitates programmatic campaign management and response data collection.

**SDK Implementation Routes**: Platform-specific documentation follows consistent patterns:
- `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/` for core analytics implementation
- `/sdks/experiment-sdks/` for experimentation capabilities  
- `/sdks/ampli/` for type-safe implementation tools

## Administrative and Enterprise Capabilities

Amplitude provides comprehensive enterprise-grade functionality through dedicated administrative modules:

**Account Management** (`/admin/account-management/`) handles organizational structure, user permissions, and access control with Single Sign-on (`/admin/single-sign-on/`) integration supporting enterprise authentication systems.

**Billing and Usage** (`/admin/billing-use/`) provides transparent usage monitoring and cost management tools.

**Data Governance**: PII Integrations (`/data/pii/`) ensure compliance with privacy regulations, while comprehensive data management tools support enterprise data governance requirements.

## Integration Ecosystem

The platform maintains extensive integration capabilities through:

**Source and Destination Catalogs** providing pre-built connectors for popular tools and platforms, with taxonomized integration categories for easy discovery and implementation.

**Partner Ecosystem** enabling extended functionality through certified third-party integrations and custom implementation support.

**Migration Tools** facilitating platform transitions with comprehensive guides and automated migration utilities.

Amplitude represents a mature, enterprise-ready analytics platform that combines powerful analytical capabilities with experimentation tools, qualitative insights, and comprehensive data management, all unified through consistent APIs, SDKs, and shared data infrastructure to provide organizations with complete visibility into user behavior and product performance.
