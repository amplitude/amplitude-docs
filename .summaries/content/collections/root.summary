Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven decision making. The platform consists of several interconnected products that work together to provide end-to-end analytics capabilities from data collection to advanced experimentation.

## High-Level Product Overview

Amplitude's core offering centers around **event-based analytics** that tracks user interactions across web and mobile applications. The platform provides sophisticated chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, and Pathfinder for comprehensive user journey mapping. Beyond basic analytics, Amplitude offers advanced capabilities including A/B testing through Amplitude Experiment, in-product user engagement via Amplitude Guides and Surveys, behavioral session recording with Session Replay, and comprehensive data governance through Amplitude Data.

The platform serves product managers, growth teams, data analysts, and developers with tools ranging from no-code chart creation to advanced statistical analysis and programmatic data access. Key use cases include product optimization, user onboarding improvement, conversion funnel analysis, feature adoption tracking, and personalized user experience delivery.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational data layer, collecting and analyzing user behavior through comprehensive SDK instrumentation across Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Node.js, Python, Java, and Go platforms. This behavioral data feeds into all other Amplitude products, creating a unified user understanding.

**Amplitude Data** provides the governance layer, offering tracking plan management, schema validation, data transformation capabilities, and quality assurance tools. The Ampli developer tools generate type-safe tracking libraries that ensure instrumentation consistency across the entire product ecosystem.

**Amplitude Experiment** leverages the behavioral data from Analytics to power sophisticated A/B testing and feature flag management. The platform supports both client-side and server-side evaluation, with deep integration into Analytics for exposure tracking and statistical analysis.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** utilizes behavioral triggers and user segmentation from Analytics to deliver contextual in-product experiences. The platform shares the same user identification and targeting infrastructure, enabling personalized onboarding flows and feedback collection.

**Session Replay** integrates with the Browser SDK to provide qualitative analysis capabilities, allowing teams to watch actual user sessions and understand the "why" behind quantitative analytics data.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events and Properties**: Events represent user actions or system occurrences, while properties describe either the event itself (event properties) or the user performing the action (user properties). Group properties enable account-level reporting with the Accounts add-on.

**User Identity Management**: The platform uses Device ID (platform-specific identifiers), User ID (custom application identifiers), and Amplitude ID (internal identifiers enabling cross-device tracking) to create comprehensive user profiles through anonymous user merging.

**Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments based on behavioral criteria, with support for complex temporal parameters and logical operators. Cohorts can be shared across all Amplitude products for consistent targeting and analysis.

**Experiments and Feature Flags**: Experiments focus on hypothesis testing with statistical significance, while feature flags enable controlled feature rollouts. Both utilize the same targeting engine and variant management system.

**Tracking Plans**: Comprehensive analytics schemas that define events, properties, and validation rules, enforced through the Ampli developer tools and schema violation handling.

**Bucketing and Variants**: In experimentation, bucketing units determine consistent variant assignment, while variants represent different experiment versions with configurable traffic distribution.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates extensively with the modern data and marketing technology stack. The platform connects with **data warehouses** (Snowflake, Databricks, Amazon S3) through bidirectional data flows, enabling both data ingestion from warehouses and export of Amplitude data for broader analytics workflows.

**Third-party integrations** include comprehensive source and destination catalogs supporting platforms like Salesforce, HubSpot, Braze, and hundreds of other marketing and analytics tools. The platform provides real-time cohort synchronization and event streaming capabilities with sub-minute latency.

**Developer ecosystem integration** includes native support for popular frameworks through dedicated SDKs, Google Tag Manager integration, Segment compatibility, and Chrome extension tools for debugging and validation.

**Collaboration tools** integrate deeply with workplace platforms including Slack (notifications and chart sharing), Atlassian products (Smart Links for Confluence and Jira), Notion (chart embedding), and Google Workspace (automated reporting and data synchronization).
