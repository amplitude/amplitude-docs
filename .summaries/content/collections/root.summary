Amplitude is a comprehensive behavioral analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, conduct feature experiments, and activate insights across their product ecosystem.

## Product Architecture and Core Components

The platform consists of four primary product areas that work together to provide end-to-end analytics and experimentation capabilities:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational behavioral analytics engine, offering multiple chart types for data visualization including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Impact Analysis, Revenue LTV, Engagement Matrix, and Experiment Results. These charts enable deep behavioral analysis through cohort analysis, user journey mapping, and conversion optimization.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced statistical analysis, supporting both client-side and server-side experimentation workflows. The platform includes experiment theory documentation, advanced techniques, troubleshooting guides, and comprehensive result analysis tools.

**Amplitude CDP (Customer Data Platform)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation through Sources and Destinations, enabling organizations to collect data from multiple touchpoints and distribute insights to downstream systems. This includes audience management, warehouse-native capabilities, and PII handling.

**Specialized Products** include Session Replay for user experience analysis, Guides and Surveys for in-product messaging, and a comprehensive Partner ecosystem for third-party integrations.

## SDK and API Ecosystem

The platform provides extensive instrumentation capabilities through multiple SDKs and APIs:

**Analytics SDKs** support all major platforms including Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine, with consistent APIs for event tracking and user identification.

**Experiment SDKs** enable feature flag evaluation and experiment participation across client and server environments.

**Ampli** provides a code-generation tool that creates type-safe analytics implementations based on tracking plans, ensuring data quality and consistency.

**APIs** include Analytics API for data querying, Experiment APIs for flag management, and Guides and Surveys API for campaign management.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** are user actions tracked within the platform, forming the foundation of all behavioral analysis.

**Properties** are attributes associated with events (event properties) or users (user properties) that enable segmentation and filtering.

**Cohorts** are user segments defined by behavioral criteria or imported from external systems.

**Charts** are visualization tools that analyze event data using different analytical frameworks (segmentation, funnels, retention, etc.).

**Experiments** are controlled tests that measure the impact of product changes on user behavior.

**Feature Flags** are toggles that control feature availability and experiment participation.

**Sources** are data collection points that send events to Amplitude.

**Destinations** are external systems that receive data or cohorts from Amplitude.

**Tracking Plans** define the schema and validation rules for event instrumentation.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

The platform includes comprehensive administrative capabilities:

**Account Management** handles user provisioning, permissions, and organizational structure.

**Single Sign-On** provides enterprise authentication integration.

**Billing and Use** manages subscription tiers and usage monitoring.

**Data Governance** includes data retention policies, privacy controls, and compliance features.

## Multi-language and Accessibility

The platform supports internationalization with Japanese translation capabilities and includes accessibility features like helpful feedback mechanisms and navigation optimization.

## Integration and Migration Support

Amplitude provides extensive migration documentation for transitioning from other analytics platforms, along with troubleshooting guides and FAQ resources. The Partner Integration Platform enables bidirectional data exchange with third-party systems through cohort syncing, event streaming, and event ingestion patterns.

## Route Structure and Navigation

The documentation follows a hierarchical URL structure:
- `/analytics/` for core analytics features
- `/feature-experiment/` for experimentation capabilities  
- `/data/` for CDP and data management
- `/sdks/` for instrumentation documentation
- `/apis/` for API references
- `/admin/` for administrative functions
- `/get-started/` for onboarding content

The platform operates on a freemium model with advanced features requiring Plus or higher subscription tiers, and supports both English and Japanese localization for global accessibility.
