Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides behavioral analytics, feature experimentation, customer data management, and user engagement tools. The platform enables organizations to track user behavior, run A/B tests, manage customer data pipelines, and optimize product experiences through data-driven insights.

## Core Product Architecture and Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem consists of four primary product areas that work together to provide end-to-end customer analytics and optimization:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational behavioral analytics platform, offering multiple chart types for analyzing user behavior patterns. The analytics engine supports Event Segmentation for tracking user actions, Funnel Analysis for conversion optimization, Retention Analysis for measuring user stickiness, Cohort Analysis through Lifecycle charts, and Revenue LTV analysis for monetization insights. Advanced visualization includes Compass for metric monitoring, Journeys for user path analysis, Personas for behavioral segmentation, and specialized charts like Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, and User Sessions.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with sophisticated statistical analysis. The experimentation platform includes advanced techniques for complex testing scenarios, comprehensive experiment theory documentation, and detailed result analysis tools. The system integrates with analytics data to provide unified measurement of feature impact on user behavior.

**Amplitude CDP (Customer Data Platform)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation across the customer data lifecycle. The CDP includes extensive source and destination catalogs, audience management capabilities, data warehouse integrations, and PII handling for privacy compliance. The platform supports both real-time streaming and batch data processing.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user session recordings to provide qualitative insights into user behavior, complementing the quantitative analytics data.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Collections** represent content organization structures within the documentation system, each corresponding to specific product areas or functional domains. Collections use YAML configuration files to define routing, templating, and navigation injection parameters.

**Mount Points** (identified by UUIDs like `ba956cb4-9ae1-456a-b122-984b491048f6`) represent content mounting mechanisms that allow collections to reference external content sources or shared documentation repositories.

**Navigation Injection** uses the `inject.nav_title` parameter to associate collections with specific navigation contexts like `analytics`, `experiment`, `data`, `apis`, or `developers`.

**Blade Injection** through `inject.blade` parameters associates content with specific Amplitude products like "Amplitude Experiment", "Amplitude Session Replay", or "Amplitude Guides and Surveys".

**Route Patterns** define URL structures using variables like `{slug}`, `{parent_uri}`, and `{permalink}` to create hierarchical content organization.

**Date Behavior** controls content visibility with `past: public` and `future: private` settings for content publishing workflows.

**Site Propagation** uses `sites` arrays and `propagate` flags to manage multi-regional content distribution, particularly for English (`en`) and Japanese (`jp`) localization.

## SDK and API Infrastructure

The platform provides comprehensive SDK coverage across multiple programming languages and platforms:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser SDK for web applications, Android and iOS SDKs for mobile platforms, React Native and Flutter for cross-platform development, and server-side SDKs for Node.js, Python, Java, and Go. Each SDK collection is mounted to external repositories and routed under `/sdks/analytics/` paths.

**Experiment SDKs** provide feature flagging and experimentation capabilities across the same platform coverage, routed under `/sdks/experiment-sdks/`.

**Ampli** represents Amplitude's type-safe analytics wrapper that generates strongly-typed tracking libraries based on tracking plans, providing compile-time validation for analytics implementation.

**API Collections** cover Analytics APIs for data ingestion and querying, Experiment APIs for feature flag management, and specialized APIs for Guides and Surveys functionality. APIs are consistently routed under `/apis/` paths with product-specific subdirectories.

## Data Management and Integration Ecosystem

The CDP functionality encompasses comprehensive data integration capabilities:

**Source Catalog** provides over 70 pre-built integrations for data ingestion from marketing tools, data warehouses, customer engagement platforms, and attribution networks. Sources are categorized by integration types and support various authentication methods.

**Destination Catalog** enables data activation by sending Amplitude data and audiences to external platforms for marketing automation, personalization, and operational workflows.

**Warehouse-native Amplitude** supports direct querying and analysis of data within customer data warehouses like Snowflake, BigQuery, and Databricks.

**Audiences** functionality allows creation of behavioral cohorts that can be exported to external platforms for targeted marketing and personalization.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** covers user provisioning, role-based access control, and organizational settings.

**Single Sign-on** provides enterprise authentication integration with SAML and OAuth providers.

**Billing and Use** includes usage monitoring, plan management, and cost optimization tools.

**Migration** documentation supports platform transitions and data migration scenarios.

## Specialized Product Offerings

**Guides and Surveys** (separate product blade) provides in-product messaging and user feedback collection capabilities with dedicated APIs and SDKs.

**Web Experiment** offers specialized experimentation tools for web-based testing scenarios.

**Partners** ecosystem includes third-party integrations and certified implementation partners.

## Content Organization and Localization

The platform supports multi-regional deployment with dedicated Japanese translation collections and region-specific content propagation. Content is organized hierarchically with root-level sections, product-specific collections, and feature-specific subcollections.

**Academy Content** provides educational resources and training materials.

**FAQ and Troubleshooting** offers comprehensive support documentation across all product areas.

**Legacy Charts** maintains backward compatibility documentation for deprecated analytics features.

The Amplitude platform represents a complete customer analytics and optimization ecosystem that combines behavioral analytics, experimentation, customer data management, and user engagement tools into an integrated platform for data-driven product development and marketing optimization. The extensive SDK coverage, API infrastructure, and integration ecosystem enable organizations to implement comprehensive analytics and experimentation workflows across their entire technology stack.
