Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple integrated products including Analytics, Experiment (A/B testing), Session Replay, Customer Data Platform (CDP), and Guides & Surveys.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform operates through a unified data collection and analysis ecosystem built around several key components:

**Analytics Core** serves as the foundational product providing behavioral analytics through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Personas, Compass, Impact Analysis, Revenue LTV, Engagement Matrix, Stickiness, and Data Tables. Each chart type offers specialized analysis capabilities for different aspects of user behavior and business metrics.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced statistical analysis, supporting both client-side and server-side experimentation workflows. The product includes experiment theory documentation, advanced techniques, troubleshooting guides, and comprehensive SDK support.

**Session Replay** captures and reconstructs user interactions across web and mobile applications, providing visual insights through session recordings and heatmaps to understand user engagement patterns.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation through source and destination catalogs, audience management, and warehouse-native capabilities.

## SDK and Integration Ecosystem

The platform provides extensive SDK support across multiple programming languages and platforms:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal implementations, each following platform-specific best practices while maintaining consistent API patterns.

**Experiment SDKs** offer dedicated experimentation capabilities with feature flag evaluation, variant assignment, and statistical analysis integration.

**Ampli** provides a code-generation tool that creates type-safe analytics implementations based on tracking plans, ensuring data quality and consistency across development teams.

All SDKs follow consistent patterns for initialization, event tracking, user identification, and configuration management, with route structures like `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/{slug}` and `/sdks/experiment-sdks/{slug}`.

## API Infrastructure

The platform exposes comprehensive APIs for programmatic access:

**Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/{slug}`) provides endpoints for data ingestion, querying, and export capabilities.

**Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/{slug}`) enable programmatic experiment management, variant assignment, and results analysis.

**Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/{slug}`) supports in-product messaging and feedback collection workflows.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** represent user actions or system occurrences tracked within applications, forming the foundation of all analytics analysis.

**Properties** are key-value pairs attached to events providing contextual information about user actions, device characteristics, and custom business metrics.

**Cohorts** define user segments based on behavioral criteria, demographic attributes, or custom properties for targeted analysis and experimentation.

**Funnels** track user progression through defined sequences of events, measuring conversion rates and identifying drop-off points in user journeys.

**Retention** measures user return behavior over specified time periods, analyzing product stickiness and engagement patterns.

**Experiments** encompass A/B tests, feature flags, and multivariate tests with statistical significance testing and confidence interval analysis.

**Variants** represent different versions of features or experiences delivered to users within experiments.

**Flags** control feature visibility and behavior modification without code deployments.

**Destinations** are external systems receiving data from Amplitude's CDP, including marketing tools, data warehouses, and business intelligence platforms.

**Sources** represent data ingestion points including SDKs, server-side implementations, and third-party integrations feeding data into Amplitude.

## Data Management and Privacy

The platform implements comprehensive data governance through:

**PII Management** (`/data/pii/{slug}`) provides tools for handling personally identifiable information with privacy controls and compliance features.

**Data Tables** offer direct access to underlying event data with SQL-like querying capabilities for advanced analysis.

**Audiences** enable behavioral segmentation with real-time updates and cross-platform activation through destination integrations.

**Warehouse-native Amplitude** allows organizations to run Amplitude analytics directly on their existing data warehouse infrastructure while maintaining data residency and governance requirements.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** (`/admin/account-management/{slug}`) provides organization-level controls for user permissions, project management, and access governance.

**Single Sign-On** (`/admin/single-sign-on/{slug}`) enables enterprise authentication integration with SAML and OAuth providers.

**Billing and Use** (`/admin/billing-use/{slug}`) offers usage monitoring, plan management, and cost optimization tools for enterprise deployments.

## Specialized Products and Features

**Guides and Surveys** (`/guides-and-surveys/{slug}`) enables in-product messaging, user onboarding flows, and feedback collection with targeting based on behavioral data and user properties.

**Web Experiment** (`/web-experiment/{slug}`) provides specialized experimentation capabilities for web-based applications with visual editor support and DOM manipulation features.

**Partners** (`/partners/{slug}`) encompasses third-party integrations, technology partnerships, and ecosystem extensions that extend Amplitude's capabilities.

## Global and Localization Support

The platform supports internationalization with dedicated Japanese translation collections (`sites: jp`) and multi-site content management, enabling global deployments with localized documentation and user interfaces.

## Migration and Onboarding

**Get Started** (`/get-started/{slug}`) provides comprehensive onboarding documentation for new users and implementations.

**Migration** (`/migration/{slug}`) offers guidance for transitioning from other analytics platforms with data mapping, SDK migration paths, and best practices for maintaining data continuity.

**Academy Content** serves as educational resources for platform mastery and analytics best practices.

The platform's architecture emphasizes developer experience through comprehensive documentation, consistent API patterns, and extensive SDK support while providing enterprise-grade features for data governance, privacy compliance, and organizational management. The unified approach to analytics, experimentation, and customer data management positions Amplitude as a complete solution for product intelligence and growth optimization.
