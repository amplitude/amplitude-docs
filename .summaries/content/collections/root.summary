Amplitude is a comprehensive behavioral analytics and experimentation platform that enables businesses to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment (A/B testing), Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Core Product Architecture and Relationships

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational product, providing behavioral event tracking and analysis through multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, Revenue LTV, and Experiment Results. These charts enable comprehensive user behavior analysis across acquisition, activation, engagement, retention, and revenue metrics.

**Amplitude Experiment** integrates deeply with Analytics to provide feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities. The platform includes advanced statistical methods, experiment theory, workflow management, and troubleshooting tools. Experiment results are analyzed through dedicated chart types within Analytics, creating a unified experimentation and analysis workflow.

**Session Replay** captures and analyzes user sessions to provide qualitative insights that complement quantitative behavioral data, enabling teams to understand not just what users do, but how they interact with products.

**Guides and Surveys** enables in-product messaging and feedback collection, allowing teams to gather user insights and guide product adoption directly within applications.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** provides comprehensive data management including Sources, Destinations, Audiences, and warehouse-native capabilities, enabling unified customer data collection and activation across marketing and product tools.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** are discrete user actions tracked within applications, forming the foundation of behavioral analysis. Events contain properties that provide context and enable segmentation.

**User Properties** are attributes associated with users that persist across sessions, enabling cohort analysis and personalization.

**Cohorts** are user segments defined by behavioral criteria or imported from external systems, enabling targeted analysis and campaign activation.

**Funnels** track user progression through defined sequences of events, measuring conversion rates and identifying drop-off points.

**Retention** measures user return behavior over time, critical for understanding product stickiness and long-term engagement.

**Amplitude IDs** provide unified user identification across devices and sessions, enabling accurate cross-platform user journey tracking.

**Feature Flags** control feature visibility and enable gradual rollouts, while **Experiments** test different variations to measure impact on key metrics.

**Attribution** connects user acquisition sources to downstream behavior and revenue, enabling marketing effectiveness measurement.

## SDK and API Ecosystem

Amplitude provides comprehensive instrumentation through multiple SDKs:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal implementations, enabling event tracking across web, mobile, and server-side environments.

**Experiment SDKs** provide feature flag evaluation and experiment assignment across the same platform coverage, ensuring consistent experimentation capabilities.

**Ampli** serves as a type-safe wrapper that generates strongly-typed tracking libraries from Amplitude's Data taxonomy, ensuring implementation accuracy and reducing tracking errors.

**APIs** include Analytics API for server-side event ingestion, Experiment APIs for programmatic experiment management, and Guides and Surveys API for in-product messaging control.

## Data Integration and Activation

The **Source Catalog** provides over 70 integrations for data ingestion from marketing platforms, customer engagement tools, payment processors, and data warehouses. Integration patterns include real-time event streaming, batch processing, and bidirectional data synchronization.

The **Destination Catalog** enables data activation by sending Amplitude insights to marketing automation platforms, advertising networks, and business intelligence tools, creating closed-loop optimization workflows.

**Warehouse-native Amplitude** allows analysis of data stored in cloud data warehouses (BigQuery, Snowflake, Databricks) without data movement, enabling analysis at enterprise scale while maintaining data governance.

## Enterprise Administration and Governance

**Account Management** provides organization-level controls including user permissions, project management, and access controls.

**Single Sign-On (SSO)** enables enterprise authentication through SAML and OAuth providers.

**Billing and Use** management provides usage monitoring and cost optimization tools.

**PII Integrations** ensure privacy compliance through automated data handling and user privacy controls.

## Implementation Patterns and Technical Architecture

**Route Structures** follow consistent patterns:
- Analytics charts: `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/{slug}`
- SDKs: `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/{slug}` and `/sdks/experiment-sdks/{slug}`
- APIs: `/apis/{product}/{slug}`
- Data management: `/data/{feature}/{slug}`
- Administration: `/admin/{feature}/{slug}`

**Navigation Injection** creates consistent user experience through standardized navigation titles (analytics, experiment, data, apis, developers, admin) and product blade identification.

**Multi-site Support** includes English (en) and Japanese (jp) localization with content propagation controls.

**Preview Targets** enable content preview across different environments with automatic refresh capabilities.

**Mount Points** connect related content collections, creating hierarchical documentation structures that mirror product relationships.

## Advanced Capabilities and Specialized Features

**Advanced Techniques** in experimentation include statistical methods, power analysis, and complex experimental designs.

**Under the Hood** documentation explains statistical engines, data processing architectures, and algorithmic approaches.

**Migration** tools and documentation support platform transitions and data movement between analytics providers.

**Partners** ecosystem extends platform capabilities through certified integrations and professional services.

**Academy Content** provides educational resources for platform adoption and best practices.

**Legacy Charts** maintain backward compatibility while transitioning users to enhanced analytics capabilities.

The platform architecture demonstrates sophisticated content management with date-based publishing controls, revision management, and structured content organization that mirrors the product's technical architecture. This documentation system supports both technical implementation and business use case guidance across Amplitude's comprehensive behavioral analytics and experimentation platform.
