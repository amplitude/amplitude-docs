## Amplitude Analytics Platform

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics platform that provides businesses with advanced user behavior tracking, revenue analytics, and data-driven insights across web and mobile applications. The platform combines robust data ingestion capabilities with specialized monetization tracking to deliver end-to-end analytics solutions for understanding customer journeys, optimizing product experiences, and maximizing revenue performance.

## Product Architecture and Feature Integration

The Amplitude platform operates through two interconnected core systems that work together to provide comprehensive analytics capabilities:

**Data Ingestion Infrastructure** serves as the foundational layer, capturing all user interactions, behavioral events, and contextual data through dual API endpoints optimized for different operational requirements. The HTTP V2 API handles real-time event streaming for immediate analytics feedback, while the Batch Event Upload API processes high-volume bulk data for enterprise-scale operations.

**Revenue Tracking System** functions as a specialized overlay that captures, verifies, and analyzes monetization events with built-in fraud prevention and platform-specific validation. This system integrates directly with the core ingestion infrastructure while adding sophisticated verification mechanisms for mobile app purchases and comprehensive revenue attribution modeling.

The relationship between these systems creates a unified analytics ecosystem where behavioral data and revenue events flow through shared processing pipelines, enabling businesses to correlate user engagement patterns with purchasing behavior and lifetime value calculations. Revenue events utilize the same foundational event schema as behavioral tracking while extending it with specialized monetization properties and verification workflows.

## Core Nomenclature and Definitions

**Event Architecture:**
- `event_type`: Classification system for all tracked user actions and revenue transactions
- `user_id`: Persistent authenticated user identifier linking behavioral and revenue data
- `device_id`: Anonymous device tracking enabling cross-session analysis
- `insert_id`: Deduplication mechanism preventing duplicate event processing across both behavioral and revenue tracking
- `session_id`: Logical grouping for related activities within user sessions

**Revenue-Specific Properties:**
- `$revenue`: Total transaction amount for monetization tracking
- `$price`: Unit cost for individual items in revenue calculations
- `$quantity`: Purchase volume for transaction analysis
- `$productId`: Product catalog identifier for revenue attribution
- `$revenueType`: Revenue categorization (subscription, one-time purchase, etc.)
- `$currency`: ISO 4217 currency standardization for global operations

**Data Attribution Models:**
- `user_properties`: Persistent attributes maintained across sessions for both behavioral and revenue analysis
- `event_properties`: Contextual metadata for individual events and transactions
- `group_properties`: Organizational-level attributes supporting B2B analytics
- `groups`: Entity association mechanism linking users to accounts or organizations

**Revenue Event Classification:**
- **Revenue**: Standard unverified purchase events
- **Revenue (Verified)**: Platform-authenticated transactions with validation
- **Revenue (Unverified)**: Failed or suspicious transactions flagged by verification systems

## Ecosystem Positioning and Integration

Amplitude positions itself as a central analytics hub that unifies user behavior analysis with revenue intelligence, creating a comprehensive view of customer value and product performance. The platform's dual-API architecture supports diverse implementation patterns, from lightweight mobile app tracking to enterprise data warehouse synchronization.

**Third-Party Integration Layer:** The `partner_id` parameter enables CDPs, marketing platforms, and data warehouses to proxy events while maintaining data lineage and attribution accuracy.

**Platform Verification Integration:** Automated connections to iOS App Store and Google Play Store validation services ensure revenue data integrity through platform-native verification mechanisms.

**Privacy and Compliance Framework:** Built-in opt-out mechanisms (`setOptOut`) and device silencing capabilities support GDPR compliance and user privacy management across both behavioral and revenue tracking.

**Analytics Pipeline Integration:** All collected data flows through Amplitude's real-time processing infrastructure to power dashboards, cohort analysis, Revenue LTV charts, and predictive analytics features, creating actionable insights from the combined behavioral and monetization datasets.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**HTTP V2 API (Real-time Ingestion):**
- Endpoint: `POST api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`
- Constraints: 1MB payloads, 2000 events per request
- Rate limiting: 1800 user property updates per hour per project
- Use case: Real-time behavioral tracking and immediate revenue event processing

**Batch Event Upload API (High-volume Processing):**
- Endpoint: `POST /batch`
- Constraints: 20MB maximum payload size
- Rate limiting: 1000 events per second per device/user, 500,000 events per day
- Use case: Bulk data migration, ETL processes, historical revenue data imports

**Revenue Tracking Methods:**
- `logRevenueV2`: Primary programmatic interface for revenue event submission with full property support
- Platform verification APIs: Automated iOS iTunes Connect and Google Play validation integration
- Server-side HTTP API: Revenue event submission supporting complete monetization schema

**Authentication and Security:**
- `api_key` parameter authentication for all endpoints
- iTunes Connect Shared Secret for iOS purchase verification
- Google Play License Public Key for Android purchase validation

**Rate Limiting and Throttling:**
- EPDS/EPUS (Events Per Device/User per Second) controls for batch processing
- HTTP 429 responses with retry-after headers for capacity management
- Dynamic throttling based on payload complexity and verification requirements

The platform's architecture enables flexible deployment strategies ranging from simple mobile app analytics to complex enterprise revenue intelligence systems, supporting both streaming and batch data collection patterns within a unified analytics ecosystem that correlates user behavior with business outcomes.
