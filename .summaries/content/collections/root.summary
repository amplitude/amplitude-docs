## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: A discrete user action or system occurrence tracked in Amplitude
- **User**: An individual using a product, identified by a unique ID
- **Session**: A period of continuous user engagement with a product
- **Cohort**: A group of users who share common characteristics or behaviors
- **Segment**: A subset of users defined by specific criteria
- **Property**: Metadata associated with events or users
- **Funnel**: A sequence of events representing a conversion path
- **Retention**: Measurement of continued product usage over time

- **Source**: An origin point for data collection
- **Destination**: An endpoint for data export or activation

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude platform is designed as an integrated ecosystem where components work together:

1. **Data Collection**: SDKs and sources capture user behavior data
2. **Data Processing**: Raw data is processed, enriched, and organized
3. **Analysis**: Analytics tools provide insights from the processed data
4. **Experimentation**: Insights drive hypotheses tested through experiments
5. **Activation**: Findings are implemented through product changes or audience targeting
6. **Engagement**: Users are engaged through targeted messaging and feedback collection

The platform supports a closed-loop analytics process where insights lead to experiments, which generate more data for analysis, creating a continuous improvement cycle.

## Technical Implementation

### SDK Installation Examples

```javascript
// Browser SDK
import * as amplitude from '@amplitude/analytics-browser';
amplitude.init('API_KEY');
```

```swift
// iOS SDK
import Amplitude
Amplitude.instance().initializeApiKey("API_KEY")
```

```java
// Android SDK
Amplitude amplitude = Amplitude.getInstance();
amplitude.initialize(getApplicationContext(), "API_KEY");
```
