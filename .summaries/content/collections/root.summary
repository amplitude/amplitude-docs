Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven decision making. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, CDP (Customer Data Platform), and supporting tools for data ingestion, audience management, and developer workflows.

## Core Product Architecture and Relationships

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, built on a multi-layered architecture centered around events, users, and groups. The platform processes behavioral data through real-time ingestion pipelines via HTTP V2 API, Batch API, and Identify API endpoints, supported by comprehensive SDKs for web, mobile, and server-side implementations. Analytics provides sophisticated visualization through specialized chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys (Pathfinder), and advanced features like Anomaly + Forecast detection using Prophet algorithms.

**Amplitude Experiment** extends the platform with feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities, integrating directly with Analytics for behavioral cohort targeting and statistical analysis. The product includes advanced experimentation features like mutual exclusion groups, holdout testing, and sophisticated statistical engines for experiment analysis.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and reconstructs user interactions across web, mobile, and React Native applications through DOM interaction recording, heatmaps (click maps, selector maps, scroll maps), and visual session playback. The product implements comprehensive privacy controls with three masking levels and integrates with Analytics through automatic session ID property injection.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** functionality is delivered through the extensive Source Catalog (60+ integrations) and Destination Catalog, enabling data orchestration across marketing technology stacks, data warehouses, and customer engagement platforms.

## Key Product Features and Integration Patterns

**Multi-Platform SDK Ecosystem**: The platform supports comprehensive instrumentation through Browser SDK, Android SDK, iOS SDK, React Native SDK, Flutter SDK, Unity SDK, Unreal SDK, and server-side SDKs for Node.js, Python, Java, and Go. Each SDK implements consistent event tracking patterns with platform-specific optimizations and features like autocapture for web applications.

**Ampli** provides type-safe analytics implementation through code generation, creating strongly-typed tracking libraries that ensure data quality and reduce instrumentation errors across development teams.

**Account-Level Analytics**: The Accounts add-on enables B2B analytics through group-level analysis, supporting up to 5 group types per project with dynamic group properties and Salesforce integration for enterprise customer data synchronization.

**Behavioral Cohorts and Audiences**: Dynamic user segmentation based on behavioral patterns, with bidirectional integration to marketing platforms for campaign targeting and personalization. Cohorts support complex temporal parameters and logical operators for sophisticated audience definition.

**Collaboration Tools**: Spaces organize teams and projects, Dashboards aggregate key metrics, and Notebooks provide analytical storytelling capabilities with external sharing through public links and native integrations to Slack, Confluence, Jira, Notion, Miro, and Google Workspace.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Events and Properties**: Events capture user actions with associated event properties providing contextual information. User properties describe individual characteristics, while group properties (in B2B scenarios) describe organizational attributes.

**Sessions**: Defined as periods of user activity with configurable timeout periods, supporting session metrics including entries, exits, totals, and duration calculations for marketing analytics.

**Attribution Models**: First-touch and last-touch attribution for marketing channel analysis with configurable lookback windows and UTM parameter tracking.

**Privacy and Masking**: Session Replay implements Conservative, Light, and Medium masking levels with CSS selector-based overrides and custom data attribute controls (`amp-mask`/`amp-unmask`) for GDPR compliance.

**Integration Patterns**: Source Catalog operates on Raw-Events Integration, Event-Streaming Integration, Cohorts Integration, and Attribution Integration patterns, defining data flow into Amplitude's analytics engine.

**Sampling and Configuration**: `sampleRate` controls recording probability (0.0-1.0), `enableRemoteConfig` enables server-side configuration management, and `serverZone` supports EU data residency compliance.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The platform integrates extensively with marketing technology through comprehensive attribution tracking, UTM parameter processing, and channel classification for CAC, ROAS, CTR, and CPC metrics. Development workflows are supported through Releases tracking with semantic versioning and feature flag integration.

**Data Warehouse Integration** includes sophisticated sync strategies for Snowflake (Full Sync, Timestamp-based incremental, Append Only, Mirror Sync), BigQuery with GA4 import capabilities, and Databricks with Change Data Feed (CDF) support. Cloud storage integrations support Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage with multiple file format handling.

**Marketing Attribution Ecosystem** covers mobile measurement platforms (AppsFlyer, Adjust, Kochava) using Attribution API with ADID/IDFA matching and 72-hour attribution windows. Email marketing platforms (HubSpot, SendGrid, Mailchimp, Braze) provide bidirectional cohort sharing for behavioral targeting.

**Customer Engagement Tools** include user onboarding platforms (Chameleon, Userflow, Userguiding, Bento) streaming product tour events, and survey platforms (Qualtrics, Sprig, Survicate) enabling qualitative feedback analysis with automatic user ID mapping.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Core APIs**:
- **HTTP V2 API** (api2.amplitude.com): Primary event ingestion endpoint
- **Batch API**: Bulk event processing for high-volume scenarios  
- **Identify API**: User property updates with groups support
- **Group Identify API**: Account-level property management with operations ($set, $setOnce, $add, $append, $unset)
- **Attribution API**: Mobile attribution data processing
- **Dashboard REST API**: External dashboard and chart data access
- **User Privacy API**: Data compliance and deletion requests

**SDK Methods and Configuration**:
- `amplitude.init()`: SDK initialization with configuration options
- `amplitude.track()`: Event tracking with properties
- `amplitude.identify()`: User property updates
- `sessionReplay.init()`: Session Replay standalone initialization
- `amplitude.add(plugin)`: Plugin architecture for Session Replay integration
- `getSessionReplayProperties()`: Session metadata retrieval for third-party integration

**Advanced Configuration**: Domain proxy support for enterprise deployments with NGINX configuration examples, endpoint customization across all SDKs, and comprehensive debugging tools including Ingestion Debugger, User Lookup, and Chrome Instrumentation Explorer extension.

**Enterprise Features**: Single Sign-On (SSO) integration, organizational privacy settings, consent management platform (CMP) integration, and configurable data retention policies with BAA compliance options for healthcare organizations.

The platform represents a comprehensive analytics and experimentation ecosystem designed to support both technical and non-technical users in understanding customer behavior, optimizing product experiences, and driving measurable business outcomes through data-driven decision making.
