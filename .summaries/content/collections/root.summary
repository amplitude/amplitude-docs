Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP), all unified through a robust SDK ecosystem and API infrastructure.

## Core Product Architecture and Relationships

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational product, providing behavioral analytics through multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Revenue LTV, and Experiment Results. These charts work together to provide comprehensive user behavior analysis, from basic event tracking to advanced cohort analysis and revenue attribution.

**Amplitude Experiment** integrates deeply with the analytics platform to provide feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities. It includes advanced techniques, experiment theory, workflow management, and troubleshooting tools. The platform supports both client-side and server-side experimentation with sophisticated statistical analysis and "under the hood" technical implementations.

**Session Replay** captures and analyzes user interactions to provide qualitative insights that complement quantitative analytics data, enabling teams to understand the "why" behind user behaviors identified in charts and experiments.

**Guides and Surveys** (branded as "Amplitude Guides and Surveys") provides in-product user experience tools for onboarding, engagement, and feedback collection, with direct integration to analytics for measuring the impact of these interventions.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation through Sources, Destinations, Audiences, and warehouse-native capabilities, ensuring clean, actionable data flows across the entire platform.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Events and Properties**: The fundamental data model where events represent user actions and properties provide contextual information about users, events, and groups.

**Cohorts and Segments**: User groupings based on behavioral patterns or characteristics, used across analytics, experimentation, and personalization.

**Funnels and Journeys**: Sequential analysis tools where funnels measure conversion through defined steps and journeys map actual user paths.

**Retention and Stickiness**: Complementary metrics measuring user return behavior (retention) and engagement frequency (stickiness).

**Feature Flags and Variants**: Experiment configuration elements where flags control feature visibility and variants define different user experiences.

**Amplitude Query Language (AQL)**: The underlying query system that powers chart creation and data analysis across the platform.

**Instrumentation**: The process of implementing tracking code through SDKs to capture user behavior data.

**Taxonomy**: The standardized naming conventions and data structure that ensures consistent tracking across teams and products.

## SDK Ecosystem and Implementation

The platform supports comprehensive multi-platform instrumentation through dedicated SDKs:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser/JavaScript (`@amplitude/analytics-browser`), iOS (`Amplitude-Swift`), Android (`amplitude-android`), React Native (`@amplitude/analytics-react-native`), Flutter (`amplitude_flutter`), Node.js (`@amplitude/analytics-node`), Python (`amplitude-analytics`), Java (`amplitude-java`), Go (`amplitude-go`), Unity (`com.amplitude.unity-analytics`), and Unreal Engine implementations.

**Experiment SDKs** provide feature flagging capabilities across platforms with evaluation engines, local evaluation, and remote evaluation modes. Key methods include `fetch()`, `evaluate()`, and `exposure()` for flag management.

**Ampli** serves as a type-safe wrapper that generates strongly-typed tracking libraries from the Amplitude Data taxonomy, ensuring implementation consistency and reducing tracking errors.

**Session Replay SDK** captures user interactions with privacy controls and performance optimization features.

Common SDK patterns include initialization with API keys, user identification through `setUserId()`, event tracking via `track()`, and user property management through `identify()`. SDKs support both synchronous and asynchronous operation modes with offline queuing and retry mechanisms.

## API Infrastructure and Integration Points

**Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/`) provides programmatic access to event ingestion, user management, and data export with endpoints like:
- `POST /2/httpapi` for event ingestion
- `GET /2/events` for event data retrieval  
- `POST /usersearch` for user lookup
- `GET /export` for raw data export

**Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) enable flag management, variant assignment, and experiment configuration with endpoints for evaluation, assignment, and exposure tracking.

**Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) supports programmatic management of in-product experiences and survey data collection.

## Data Management and Integration Capabilities

**Source Catalog** provides pre-built integrations for data ingestion from various platforms including web analytics, mobile analytics, marketing tools, and business systems. Sources support both real-time streaming and batch data import.

**Destination Catalog** enables data activation by sending Amplitude data to external systems including marketing automation platforms, data warehouses, business intelligence tools, and customer success platforms. Destinations support audience syncing, event forwarding, and cohort exports.

**Warehouse-native Amplitude** allows organizations to run Amplitude analytics directly on their data warehouse (Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks) without data movement, providing enhanced security and reduced latency.

**PII Integrations** offer privacy-compliant data handling with tokenization, hashing, and secure data transfer mechanisms for sensitive information.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** provides organization-level controls including user provisioning, role management, project organization, and billing oversight.

**Single Sign-On (SSO)** supports SAML 2.0 and OIDC protocols for enterprise authentication with providers like Okta, Azure AD, and Google Workspace.

**Billing and Usage** monitoring provides real-time visibility into event volume, user counts, and feature usage with configurable alerts and usage optimization recommendations.

**Migration** tools and documentation support transitions from other analytics platforms including Google Analytics, Mixpanel, and Adobe Analytics with data mapping and validation utilities.

The platform operates across multiple deployment regions (US and EU) with enterprise-grade security, compliance certifications (SOC 2, GDPR, CCPA), and 99.9% uptime SLA. Advanced features include custom domains, IP allowlisting, and dedicated infrastructure options for high-volume enterprise customers.
