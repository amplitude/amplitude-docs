# Amplitude Product Documentation Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive analytics and experimentation platform designed to help businesses understand user behavior, optimize digital experiences, and drive growth. The platform consists of several integrated products that collectively provide capabilities for data collection, analysis, experimentation, and visualization.

The core products in the Amplitude ecosystem include:

1. **Amplitude Analytics** - The central analytics engine for understanding user behavior through charts, funnels, cohorts, and other analysis tools
2. **Amplitude Data** - Data management solution for collecting, processing, and governing user data
3. **Amplitude Experiment** - Feature flagging and experimentation platform for testing hypotheses and measuring impact
4. **Amplitude Session Replay** - Visual analytics tool for recording and replaying user sessions

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Amplitude platform follows an integrated architecture where:

- **Data** forms the foundation layer, handling collection and processing
- **Analytics** builds on this data to provide insights through various chart types and analysis methods
- **Experiment** leverages analytics insights to enable targeted experimentation
- **Session Replay** adds qualitative visual context to complement quantitative analysis

The documentation is organized into collections that reflect this product structure, with specialized sections for each product area:

- Analytics-focused collections (charts, funnels, retention analysis, etc.)
- Data-focused collections (sources, audiences, PII integrations)
- Experiment-focused collections (experiment theory, workflow, under-the-hood)
- SDK documentation for various platforms (iOS, Android, Web, etc.)

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Analytics Terminology

## Administrative Features

The platform includes administrative capabilities for:
- **Account Management** - User and organization administration
- **Billing and Usage** - Subscription and consumption tracking
- **Single Sign-On** - Enterprise authentication integration

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into collections that follow a logical hierarchy:
1. **Get Started** - Introductory materials and onboarding guides
2. **Product-specific collections** - Detailed documentation for each product area
3. **SDK documentation** - Implementation guides for different platforms
4. **API documentation** - Reference materials for programmatic integration
5. **Administrative guides** - Account and billing management information

The documentation uses a consistent URL structure that reflects this organization, with routes like:
- `/analytics/charts/{feature}`
- `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/{topic}`
- `/apis/{product}/{endpoint}`
- `/feature-experiment/{topic}`
- `/data/{feature}`

This structure provides a clear navigation path for users seeking information about specific aspects of the Amplitude platform.
