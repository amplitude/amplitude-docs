Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, run experiments, and manage feature delivery across their digital products. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Core Product Architecture

The platform is organized around several primary products that work together to provide end-to-end user analytics and optimization capabilities:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, providing behavioral event tracking, user journey analysis, and comprehensive reporting through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Cohort Analysis, and Revenue LTV tracking.

**Amplitude Experiment** is the experimentation and feature flagging platform that enables A/B testing, progressive feature delivery, and statistical analysis of product changes. It operates through a sophisticated evaluation engine supporting both remote and local evaluation modes.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and reconstructs user sessions for qualitative analysis of user interactions and behavior patterns.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** facilitates in-product user research and engagement through targeted surveys and user guidance workflows.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation across the entire customer data ecosystem, including source and destination integrations.

## Product Relationships and Data Flow

The products are deeply integrated through a unified data model centered on user identification (user_id/device_id) and event tracking. Analytics serves as the data foundation, collecting behavioral events that feed into Experiment for user targeting and results analysis. Session Replay provides qualitative context to quantitative Analytics insights, while Guides and Surveys enable direct user feedback collection that can inform both Analytics segmentation and Experiment hypothesis formation.

The CDP orchestrates data flow between products and external systems through an extensive catalog of source integrations (data ingestion) and destination integrations (data activation). This creates a unified customer profile that enhances targeting capabilities across all products.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events**: Discrete user actions tracked within the platform, forming the basis of all analytics and experimentation
**Properties**: Attributes associated with events or users that enable segmentation and targeting
**Cohorts**: Dynamic or static user segments based on behavioral criteria or properties
**Deployments**: Environment-specific configurations (client-side/server-side) for SDK implementation
**Flags/Experiments**: Feature toggles that can optionally include statistical measurement capabilities
**Variants**: Different versions or configurations within an experiment or feature flag
**Bucketing**: The process of assigning users to experiment variants using consistent hashing algorithms
**Exposure Events**: Analytics events automatically fired when users encounter feature flag variants
**Charts**: Specific analysis types within Analytics (Segmentation, Funnel, Retention, etc.)
**Journeys**: User path analysis showing navigation flows through product experiences
**Personas**: Behavioral user segments based on engagement patterns and characteristics

## Broader Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude operates as a central hub in the modern data stack, integrating with data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift) through warehouse-native capabilities, marketing automation platforms, customer support tools, and business intelligence systems. The platform supports both real-time and batch data processing, enabling immediate personalization and long-term strategic analysis.

The Partner ecosystem extends functionality through pre-built integrations and custom webhook configurations. Enterprise customers can leverage advanced features like single sign-on (SSO), custom permissions, and API-driven workflows for programmatic management.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

The platform exposes several API categories:

**Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/`) handles event ingestion, user properties, and data export
**Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) manage flag configuration, user assignments, and results retrieval  
**Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) controls survey deployment and response collection

SDK implementation follows consistent patterns across platforms with routes like:
- `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/` for behavioral tracking SDKs (Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal, Node.js, Python, Java, Go)
- `/sdks/experiment-sdks/` for experimentation SDKs
- `/sdks/ampli/` for type-safe analytics implementation

Command-line tools and programmatic access enable automated deployment workflows, with specific endpoints for user management (`/admin/account-management/`), billing oversight (`/admin/billing-use/`), and system administration (`/admin/single-sign-on/`).

The platform supports multi-language documentation with Japanese translations and comprehensive troubleshooting resources, indicating global enterprise adoption. Advanced implementation guidance covers topics from basic instrumentation (`/get-started/`, `/migration/`) to sophisticated techniques (`/feature-experiment/advanced-techniques/`, `/feature-experiment/under-the-hood/`) and theoretical foundations (`/feature-experiment/experiment-theory/`).
