## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's products form an integrated ecosystem where:

1. **Data Collection** occurs through various SDKs and integrations (Source Catalog)
2. **Data Processing** happens in the core platform
3. **Analysis and Visualization** is performed through Analytics Charts and tools
4. **Action** is taken through Experimentation and integrations (Destination Catalog)

The platform supports a complete analytics lifecycle:
- Collect user behavior data across platforms
- Analyze patterns and identify opportunities
- Test hypotheses through experimentation
- Measure impact and iterate

## Technical Implementation

### SDK Implementation
SDKs are available for multiple platforms with a consistent event tracking methodology:

```javascript
// Browser SDK example
amplitude.track('Button Clicked', {
  buttonColor: 'blue',
  buttonText: 'Sign Up'
});
```
