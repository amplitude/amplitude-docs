Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform centers around event-based analytics with integrated experimentation capabilities, session replay, and customer data platform (CDP) functionality.

## Core Product Architecture

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational product, providing real-time user behavior tracking through an event-based architecture. The platform captures user interactions as events with associated properties, enabling detailed analysis of user journeys, feature adoption, and retention patterns. The analytics core includes customizable dashboards, automated event tracking through Autocapture, and a comprehensive charting system with specialized visualizations.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced statistical analysis, including sequential testing, CUPED variance reduction, and multi-armed bandit optimization. The experimentation platform integrates directly with analytics for unified user identification and exposure tracking.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures user interactions for qualitative analysis, with configurable sampling rates and privacy controls. Session recordings integrate with analytics events for contextual debugging and user experience optimization.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** functionality includes audience segmentation, data governance, and integration management through source and destination catalogs supporting hundreds of third-party platforms.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Event Architecture
- **Events**: User actions tracked with verb+noun naming conventions, containing event properties and user context
- **Event Properties**: Contextual data attached to specific events (maximum 20 properties per event)
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes describing user characteristics across sessions
- **Group Properties**: Organizational-level attributes for B2B analytics
- **Session ID**: Millisecond timestamp-based session identification
- **Amplitude ID**: Internal user identifier with "amp_" prefix for cross-platform tracking

### User Identification System
- **Device IDs**: Platform-specific identifiers (IDFV for iOS, generated UUIDs for web/Android)
- **User IDs**: Custom identifiers for authenticated users enabling cross-device reconciliation
- **Anonymous Users**: Users tracked via device ID without explicit user ID assignment
- **User Merge**: Process combining anonymous and identified user profiles

### Analytics Metrics
- **Active Users**: Users triggering non-inactive events within specified timeframes
- **Monthly Tracked Users (MTU)**: Billing metric for unique users per calendar month
- **Retention**: User return behavior measured across daily, weekly, or monthly intervals
- **Stickiness**: Frequency of user engagement within time periods
- **Conversion**: Funnel completion rates between sequential events
- **Session**: User activity period with platform-specific timeout thresholds

### Experimentation Concepts
- **Feature Flags**: Boolean toggles for feature activation/deactivation
- **Variants**: Different versions of features or experiences in experiments
- **Allocation**: Percentage of users assigned to experiment variants
- **Exposure**: Event tracking when users encounter experiment variants
- **Statistical Significance**: Confidence level for experiment result validity
- **CUPED**: Controlled-experiment Using Pre-Experiment Data for variance reduction
- **Sequential Testing**: Continuous monitoring for early experiment conclusions
