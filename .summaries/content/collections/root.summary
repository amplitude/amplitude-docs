## Amplitude Analytics Platform

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides product teams with tools to understand user behavior, optimize experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment (A/B testing), Session Replay, CDP (Customer Data Platform), and Guides & Surveys.

## Core Product Architecture and Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem is built around a unified data foundation with several key product areas:

**Analytics Core**: The foundational analytics engine provides event tracking, user segmentation, and behavioral analysis through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, Cohort Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, and specialized charts like Compass, Lifecycle, Stickiness, and Revenue LTV. The analytics platform also includes advanced visualization tools like Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, Data Tables, and Personas for comprehensive user behavior analysis.

**Amplitude Experiment**: A feature flagging and A/B testing platform that integrates deeply with the analytics foundation. It includes advanced experimentation techniques, statistical theory components, workflow management, and troubleshooting capabilities. The platform supports both client-side and server-side experimentation with dedicated SDKs and APIs.

**Session Replay**: Captures and reconstructs user interactions across web and mobile applications, providing visual session recordings and heatmaps that complement quantitative analytics with qualitative behavioral insights.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)**: Manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation through source and destination catalogs, audience management, and warehouse-native capabilities. The CDP includes PII management integrations and comprehensive data governance tools.

**Guides & Surveys**: An in-product messaging and feedback collection system that enables teams to gather user insights and guide user experiences directly within applications.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Collections Structure**: The documentation is organized into collections representing different product areas, features, and implementation guides. Each collection has specific routing patterns (e.g., `/analytics/{slug}`, `/feature-experiment/{slug}`, `/sdks/{slug}`) and navigation hierarchies.

**Mount Points**: Many collections reference mount points (UUIDs like `ba956cb4-9ae1-456a-b122-984b491048f6`) which appear to be content management identifiers linking collections to specific content repositories or data sources.

**Navigation Injection**: Collections use `inject` parameters to specify navigation contexts (`nav_title`) such as `analytics`, `experiment`, `data`, `apis`, `developers`, indicating how content is categorized within the broader documentation structure.

**Blade Architecture**: Several collections reference "blade" components (e.g., "Amplitude Experiment", "Amplitude Session Replay", "Amplitude Guides and Surveys") suggesting a modular UI architecture where different product experiences are presented as distinct interface layers.

**Site Propagation**: Collections specify site targeting (`sites: [en, jp]`) and propagation settings, indicating multi-language support with English and Japanese localization capabilities.

## SDK and Integration Ecosystem

The platform provides extensive SDK coverage across multiple programming languages and platforms:

**Analytics SDKs**: Comprehensive SDK catalog including Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine implementations, all following consistent patterns with routes like `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/{slug}`.

**Experiment SDKs**: Dedicated experimentation SDKs that work alongside analytics SDKs to deliver feature flags and A/B test variations with statistical analysis capabilities.

**Ampli**: A code generation tool that creates type-safe analytics implementations, ensuring consistent event tracking across development teams and reducing implementation errors.

## API Architecture and Endpoints

The platform exposes multiple API layers:

**Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/{slug}`): Core analytics data access and manipulation endpoints for programmatic interaction with analytics data.

**Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/{slug}`): Feature flag management, experiment configuration, and results analysis endpoints.

**Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/{slug}`): Programmatic control over in-product messaging and survey deployment.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** (`/admin/account-management/{slug}`): User provisioning, role management, and organizational structure configuration.

**Single Sign-On** (`/admin/single-sign-on/{slug}`): Enterprise authentication integration with SAML and OAuth providers.

**Billing and Usage** (`/admin/billing-use/{slug}`): Subscription management, usage monitoring, and cost optimization tools.

## Data Management and Integration Capabilities

**Source Catalog**: Extensive library of data ingestion connectors for bringing data from various platforms into Amplitude, with taxonomic categorization through `integration_category` classifications.

**Destination Catalog**: Comprehensive set of data activation endpoints for sending Amplitude data to downstream systems, marketing tools, and data warehouses.

**Warehouse-Native Architecture**: Direct integration capabilities with modern data warehouses, allowing Amplitude to operate on existing data infrastructure without requiring data movement.

**Audience Management**: Sophisticated user segmentation and audience creation tools that integrate with the broader CDP functionality for targeted experiences and campaigns.

The platform supports both Growth and Enterprise tiers with specific feature access, advanced privacy controls, and compliance capabilities including GDPR, CCPA, and other regulatory requirements through comprehensive data governance and user privacy management systems.
