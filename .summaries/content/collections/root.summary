Amplitude is a comprehensive behavioral analytics platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior through event tracking, experimentation, and data analysis. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products designed to capture, analyze, and act on user interaction data across web, mobile, and server-side applications.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform is built around several primary product areas that work together to provide end-to-end analytics capabilities:

**Analytics** serves as the core behavioral analysis engine, featuring multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Personas, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Compass, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Revenue LTV, Data Tables, and Experiment Results. These charts enable deep analysis of user behavior patterns, conversion flows, and business metrics.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities, encompassing experiment design, statistical analysis, advanced techniques, and comprehensive result interpretation. The platform includes experiment theory documentation, workflow management, troubleshooting guides, and "under the hood" technical details.

**Data Management (CDP)** handles data ingestion, transformation, and distribution through source catalogs, destination catalogs, audiences, warehouse-native capabilities, and PII integrations. This creates a unified customer data platform for managing user information across systems.

**Session Replay** captures and analyzes user session recordings to provide qualitative insights into user behavior and experience issues.

**Guides and Surveys** enables in-product messaging and user feedback collection to drive engagement and gather user insights.

## SDK and Integration Ecosystem

Amplitude provides extensive instrumentation capabilities through platform-specific SDKs:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser SDK (`/sdks/analytics/browser/`), Android SDK (`/sdks/analytics/android/`), iOS SDK (`/sdks/analytics/ios/`), React Native SDK (`/sdks/analytics/react-native/`), Flutter SDK (`/sdks/analytics/flutter/`), Unity SDK (`/sdks/analytics/unity/`), Unreal SDK (`/sdks/analytics/unreal/`), Node.js SDK (`/sdks/analytics/node/`), Python SDK (`/sdks/analytics-sdks/python/`), Java SDK (`/sdks/analytics/java/`), and Go SDK (`/sdks/analytics/go/`).

**Experiment SDKs** (`/sdks/experiment-sdks/`) provide feature flag and experimentation capabilities across platforms.

**Ampli** (`/sdks/ampli/`) offers type-safe analytics implementation with code generation for consistent event tracking.

## API Infrastructure

The platform exposes comprehensive APIs for programmatic access:

- **Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/`) for querying behavioral data
- **Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) for managing feature flags and experiments  
- **Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) for in-product messaging

## Key Nomenclature and Concepts

**Events** represent user actions tracked within applications, forming the foundation of all analytics. Events can be filtered, segmented, and measured using various methodologies.

**Segments** define user cohorts based on properties, behaviors, or custom criteria, enabling comparative analysis across different user groups.

**Charts** are visualization interfaces that transform raw event data into actionable insights through various analytical lenses (funnels, retention, segmentation, etc.).

**Experiments** encompass A/B tests and feature flags, including statistical analysis, variant assignment, and result interpretation.

**Sources and Destinations** manage data flow into and out of Amplitude, connecting with external systems and data warehouses.

**Amplitude Agents** provide automated insights and anomaly detection capabilities.

**Rolling Windows** enable time-based aggregation functions for smoothing data over specified intervals.

**Custom Formulas** support advanced calculations using 20+ formula types including metrics, aggregation, and mathematical functions.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

The platform includes comprehensive administrative capabilities:

**Account Management** (`/admin/account-management/`) handles user provisioning, permissions, and organizational settings.

**Single Sign-on** (`/admin/single-sign-on/`) provides enterprise authentication integration.

**Billing and Use** (`/admin/billing-use/`) manages subscription, usage tracking, and cost optimization.

## Multi-language and Accessibility

The platform supports internationalization with Japanese translation capabilities (`/jp` routes) and includes comprehensive FAQ and troubleshooting documentation (`/faq/`) for user support.

## Technical Implementation Patterns

The system uses consistent URL routing patterns:
- Product areas: `/analytics/`, `/feature-experiment/`, `/data/`
- Chart types: `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/`
- SDKs: `/sdks/{product}/{platform}/`
- APIs: `/apis/{product}/`
- Administrative: `/admin/{function}/`

Collections utilize mounting systems for content organization, with preview targets for content management, injection parameters for navigation context, and date-based content visibility controls. The platform supports both real-time and historical data analysis with configurable refresh intervals and maintains data integrity through deduplication algorithms and optimized caching mechanisms.
