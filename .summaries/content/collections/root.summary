Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive data-driven decision making across web and mobile applications.

## High-Level Product Overview

Amplitude's platform consists of four core product areas: **Analytics** for behavioral analysis and insights, **Experiment** for feature flagging and A/B testing, **CDP (Customer Data Platform)** for data management and activation, and **Session Replay** for visual user behavior analysis. The platform supports multi-language documentation with dedicated Japanese translations and provides extensive developer tooling including SDKs, APIs, and code generation utilities.

The platform serves both technical implementers through comprehensive SDK libraries and business users through intuitive analytics interfaces. Key capabilities include real-time event tracking, advanced behavioral analytics, experimentation workflows, audience segmentation, and data integration across the entire customer journey.

- **Cohorts**: User segments based on shared characteristics or behaviors
- **Funnels**: Sequential user journeys with conversion analysis
- **Retention**: Measurement of user return behavior over time periods
- **Segmentation**: Filtering and grouping users or events by specific criteria

### Experimentation Concepts
- **Feature Flags**: Boolean or multivariate controls for feature activation
- **Variants**: Different versions of features being tested in experiments
- **Allocation**: Distribution of users across experiment variants
- **Statistical Significance**: Confidence level in experiment results
- **Holdout Groups**: Control populations for measuring overall impact

### Data Platform Elements
- **Sources**: Systems that send data to Amplitude (mobile apps, websites, servers)
- **Destinations**: External platforms receiving data from Amplitude (marketing tools, data warehouses)
- **Transformations**: Data processing rules applied during ingestion or export
- **Schemas**: Data structure definitions for events and properties
- **Identity Resolution**: Process of connecting user actions across devices and sessions

### Technical Implementation
- **SDK (Software Development Kit)**: Client libraries for implementing Amplitude tracking
- **API Endpoints**: Programmatic interfaces for data ingestion and retrieval
- **Plugins**: Extensible components for SDK functionality enhancement
- **Autocapture**: Automatic instrumentation of common user interactions
- **Device ID**: Anonymous identifier for user tracking across sessions
- **User ID**: Custom identifier for authenticated user tracking

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude operates as a **central analytics and experimentation hub** that integrates with the broader marketing and product technology stack. The platform connects upstream with data sources including mobile applications, websites, server-side systems, and third-party tools through its comprehensive source catalog. Downstream, it activates insights through destination integrations with marketing automation platforms, data warehouses, and business intelligence tools.

The **CDP functionality** positions Amplitude as both a data processor and data activator, enabling organizations to create unified customer profiles and trigger personalized experiences based on behavioral insights. **Session Replay** provides qualitative context to quantitative analytics, while **Experiment** enables data-driven product optimization based on analytics insights.

**Partner integrations** extend platform capabilities through pre-built connectors and specialized implementations, while the **Academy Content** and educational resources support user adoption and best practices implementation.
