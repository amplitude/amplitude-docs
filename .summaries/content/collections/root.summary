Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Core Product Architecture

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, providing event-based tracking and analysis through multiple specialized chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, and Revenue LTV. The platform supports both individual user-level and account-level analytics with advanced cohort analysis and behavioral segmentation capabilities.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced techniques for experimentation, comprehensive experiment theory documentation, and detailed results analysis. The platform includes experiment-specific troubleshooting and integrations with the broader Amplitude ecosystem.

**Session Replay** captures and analyzes user interactions through visual session recordings, providing qualitative context to quantitative analytics data.

**Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user engagement through targeted messaging and feedback collection, with dedicated API support for programmatic management.

## Product Relationships and Integration

The products operate as an integrated ecosystem where analytics data flows seamlessly between components. Charts created in Analytics can inform experiment design in Amplitude Experiment, while Session Replay provides visual context for analytical insights. The CDP serves as the central data hub, managing data ingestion through Sources and distribution through Destinations, with support for Audiences creation and PII management.

**Data Flow Architecture**: Data enters through various Sources (tracked via the Source Catalog), gets processed through the CDP, analyzed in Analytics charts, and can be distributed to external systems via Destinations (managed through the Destination Catalog). Warehouse-native Amplitude provides direct data warehouse integration for organizations preferring to keep data in their existing infrastructure.

**Collaboration Infrastructure**: The platform supports team collaboration through Spaces, shared dashboards, and comprehensive sharing capabilities. Integration with external tools like Slack, Miro, Notion, and Atlassian products enables workflow integration across organizations.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Collections Structure**: The documentation is organized into collections representing different product areas, with hierarchical routing patterns like `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/{slug}` for chart-specific documentation and `/sdks/{product}/{platform}/{slug}` for SDK documentation.

**Mount Points**: Many collections use mount identifiers (UUIDs) that appear to link to external content management systems, enabling dynamic content organization and cross-referencing.

**Navigation Injection**: Collections use `nav_title` injection to organize content within specific navigation contexts (analytics, experiment, data, apis, etc.), while `blade` injection identifies which Amplitude product the content relates to.

**Site Propagation**: Content is managed across multiple sites (primarily 'en' for English and 'jp' for Japanese), with propagation controls determining how content is distributed across locales.

## SDK and API Ecosystem

**Analytics SDKs**: Comprehensive SDK support across platforms including Android, iOS, Browser/JavaScript, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal, Node.js, Python, Java, and Go, each with platform-specific implementation guidance and best practices.

**Ampli**: A code-generation tool that creates type-safe analytics implementations, ensuring consistent event tracking across development teams and reducing implementation errors.

**API Structure**: Multiple API categories including Analytics APIs for data querying, Experiment APIs for feature flag management, and Guides and Surveys APIs for in-product messaging. The APIs follow RESTful patterns with comprehensive endpoint documentation.

**Integration Catalogs**: Extensive source and destination catalogs with taxonomies for integration categories, enabling organizations to connect Amplitude with their existing technology stack.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Context

**Enterprise Administration**: Comprehensive admin functionality covering Account Management, Billing and Use tracking, and Single Sign-on integration, supporting enterprise-scale deployments with appropriate governance and security controls.

**Developer Experience**: Strong focus on developer enablement through detailed SDK documentation, migration guides, troubleshooting resources, and instrumentation best practices. The platform provides both high-level conceptual guidance and detailed technical implementation instructions.

**Educational Resources**: Academy Content provides structured learning paths, while FAQ and Troubleshooting sections address common implementation challenges. Partner documentation enables ecosystem integrations and third-party tool connections.

**Internationalization**: Multi-language support with dedicated Japanese translation collections, indicating global market focus and localization capabilities.

The platform represents a comprehensive analytics and experimentation ecosystem designed to scale from startup implementations to enterprise-wide deployments, with extensive customization, integration, and collaboration capabilities for modern product development teams.
