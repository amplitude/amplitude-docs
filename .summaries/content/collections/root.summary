## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's platform integrates with the broader data ecosystem through:

1. **Source Catalog** - Ingest data from various platforms and databases
2. **Destination Catalog** - Export data to other tools and platforms
3. **SDK Catalog** - Client and server libraries for different platforms
4. **APIs** - Programmatic interfaces for data access and management
5. **Warehouse-Native Amplitude** - Direct integration with data warehouses

The platform supports multi-site configurations with English and Japanese language options, and includes specialized documentation for migration from other analytics platforms.

## API Endpoints and Implementation

Amplitude provides several API endpoints for programmatic interaction:

- Analytics API for querying data
- Experiment APIs for managing experiments
- Various SDK implementation methods with specific initialization patterns

SDK implementation typically follows this pattern (example for Browser SDK):
```javascript
import * as amplitude from '@amplitude/analytics-browser';

amplitude.init('API_KEY', {
  // Configuration options
});

amplitude.track('Event Name', {
  // Event properties
});
```

The platform also includes specialized tools like Session Replay with implementation patterns such as:
```javascript
import { sessionReplayPlugin } from '@amplitude/session-replay-browser';

amplitude.init('API_KEY', {
  plugins: [sessionReplayPlugin()]
});
```

The documentation is structured to support different user personas with specialized content for developers, analysts, and administrators, including troubleshooting guides and educational resources.
