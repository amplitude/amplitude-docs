Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with advanced capabilities for user behavior analysis, feature experimentation, and data-driven decision making. The platform consists of several interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP), all unified through a robust SDK ecosystem and API infrastructure.

## Core Product Architecture and Relationships

The platform operates on a hierarchical organizational structure where Analytics serves as the foundational data collection and analysis engine. Organizations contain multiple projects, each representing individual analytics implementations with dedicated API keys and configuration settings. The Analytics product provides comprehensive user behavior analysis through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, and specialized charts like Compass, Lifecycle, Stickiness, and Revenue LTV.

Amplitude Experiment integrates deeply with the Analytics foundation to provide feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities. It includes advanced techniques, experiment theory, workflow management, and troubleshooting tools. The Experiment Results chart type within Analytics provides direct visibility into experimentation outcomes, creating a seamless feedback loop between feature deployment and performance measurement.

Session Replay captures and analyzes user interaction recordings, while Guides and Surveys enables in-product user engagement and feedback collection. The CDP component manages data flow through source and destination catalogs, supporting data warehouse integrations and audience management capabilities.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Collections** represent the primary organizational structure for documentation, with each collection corresponding to a specific product area or feature set. Collections use routing patterns like `/analytics/{slug}`, `/feature-experiment/{slug}`, and `/sdks/{slug}` to organize content hierarchically.

**Mount points** (identified by UUIDs like `4f9db02a-f75c-470c-990d-31d6ffb5eebf`) link collections to specific content repositories, enabling modular content management across the platform.

**Navigation injection** through `nav_title` properties creates consistent navigation experiences, with values like `analytics`, `experiment`, `data`, `apis`, and `analytics_sdks` defining primary navigation categories.

**Blade designations** such as "Amplitude Experiment", "Amplitude Session Replay", and "Amplitude Guides and Surveys" identify specific product contexts within the broader platform ecosystem.

## SDK Ecosystem and Implementation

The platform provides extensive SDK support across multiple programming languages and platforms. Analytics SDKs include Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal implementations, all accessible through routes like `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/{slug}`. 

The Ampli SDK provides type-safe analytics implementation with code generation capabilities, while Experiment SDKs enable feature flag and experimentation integration across the same platform ecosystem. Each SDK collection maintains its own documentation structure with platform-specific implementation guides and troubleshooting resources.

## API Infrastructure and Integration

The platform exposes comprehensive API capabilities through several specialized endpoints. The Analytics API (`/apis/analytics/{slug}`) provides programmatic access to event data and analysis capabilities. Experiment APIs (`/apis/experiment/{slug}`) enable feature flag management and experiment configuration. The Guides and Surveys API (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/{slug}`) supports in-product engagement automation.

The CDP functionality includes extensive source and destination catalog integrations, with taxonomies for integration categories and specialized routing patterns like `/data/source-catalog/{slug}` and `/data/destination-catalog/{slug}`. This enables comprehensive data pipeline management and third-party system integration.

## Advanced Analytics and Chart Types

The Analytics product provides sophisticated analysis capabilities through specialized chart types. Event Segmentation enables behavioral analysis and user segmentation. Funnel Analysis tracks conversion paths and identifies drop-off points. Retention Analysis measures user engagement over time periods. The Journeys feature provides path analysis and user flow visualization.

Advanced chart types include Compass for metric correlation analysis, Lifecycle for user state transitions, Stickiness for engagement frequency measurement, and Revenue LTV for customer value analysis. The Engagement Matrix provides cohort-based behavioral analysis, while Impact Analysis measures feature and experiment effects on key metrics.

## Enterprise and Administrative Features

The platform includes comprehensive administrative capabilities through Account Management, Billing and Use monitoring, and Single Sign-on integration. Enterprise features include Portfolio functionality for cross-project analysis, Permission Groups for access control, and SCIM 2.0 provisioning for automated user management.

Data management capabilities include audience creation and management, PII handling integrations, and warehouse-native Amplitude functionality for direct data warehouse analysis. The platform supports migration workflows and provides extensive FAQ and troubleshooting resources.

## Internationalization and Content Management

The platform supports multi-site deployment with English (`en`) and Japanese (`jp`) site configurations. Content propagation controls and revision management enable sophisticated content lifecycle management across different markets and user segments.

The documentation architecture uses date-based behavior controls with public/private content states, preview targeting for content validation, and structured navigation injection to maintain consistent user experiences across the comprehensive product ecosystem.
