# Amplitude Documentation Product Overview

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics platform that helps organizations understand user behavior, optimize digital experiences, and drive business growth. The documentation is organized into several key product areas:

- **Analytics**: Core analytics functionality for tracking, analyzing, and visualizing user behavior
- **Experiment**: Feature experimentation and A/B testing capabilities
- **Data Management**: Tools for data collection, integration, and governance
- **SDKs and APIs**: Implementation resources for various platforms and integration methods
- **Account Management**: Administrative tools for managing organizations, users, and settings
- **Session Replay**: Visual session recording and playback functionality

The platform supports multiple integration methods through SDKs for various platforms (iOS, Android, Web, Unity, etc.), APIs for programmatic access, and connections to data warehouses and third-party tools through sources and destinations.

## Product Relationships and Structure

The documentation is organized into several interconnected product areas:

1. **Analytics Core**

   - User behavior analysis (User Sessions, Personas, Journeys)
   - Data exploration and reporting

2. **Experiment Platform**
   - Experiment theory and workflow
   - Advanced techniques and troubleshooting
   - SDK implementation for various platforms
   - Experiment APIs for programmatic access

3. **Data Platform**
   - Data sources and ingestion (Source Catalog)
   - Data destinations and export (Destination Catalog)
   - Audience management and segmentation
   - PII handling and privacy controls
   - CDP (Customer Data Platform) capabilities

4. **Implementation Resources**
   - SDK documentation for multiple platforms (iOS, Android, Web, React Native, etc.)
   - API documentation for Analytics and Experiment
   - Instrumentation guides and best practices

5. **Administrative Tools**
   - Account management and billing
   - Single Sign-On configuration
   - User permissions and access control

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Charts**: Visualization tools for analyzing user behavior (Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, etc.)
- **SDKs (Software Development Kits)**: Platform-specific libraries for implementing Amplitude tracking
- **Ampli**: Amplitude's type-safe wrapper for SDKs that provides code completion and validation
- **Sources**: Data integration points that bring data into Amplitude
- **Destinations**: Integration points that export data from Amplitude to other tools
- **Audiences**: Defined user segments based on behavior or properties
- **Experiments**: A/B tests to measure the impact of product changes
- **CDP (Customer Data Platform)**: Tools for managing customer data across touchpoints
- **Session Replay**: Visual recording of user sessions for qualitative analysis

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude platform consists of several integrated products that work together:

1. **Amplitude Analytics**: The core analytics platform that provides insights into user behavior through various charts and visualizations. It serves as the foundation for other Amplitude products.

2. **Amplitude Experiment**: Built on top of Analytics, it enables teams to run A/B tests and feature experiments with statistical rigor, using the same user behavior data collected in Analytics.

3. **Amplitude CDP**: Manages customer data flows between Amplitude and external systems through sources and destinations, ensuring data quality and governance.

4. **Amplitude Session Replay**: Provides visual recordings of user sessions that complement the quantitative data in Analytics for deeper qualitative insights.

5. **Data Management Tools**: Includes capabilities for managing audiences, handling PII data, and ensuring data quality across the platform.

The documentation structure reflects how these products integrate, with shared implementation resources (SDKs, APIs) and administrative tools that span across products.
