Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with advanced capabilities for product analytics, feature experimentation, customer data management, and user engagement optimization. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products designed to support data-driven product development and user experience optimization.

## Core Product Architecture

The Amplitude ecosystem is built around several primary products:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, providing event tracking, user behavior analysis, and comprehensive reporting through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, Cohort Analysis, and User Journey mapping. The analytics platform supports real-time data processing and offers sophisticated segmentation capabilities.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers enterprise-scale feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced statistical analysis, global CDN delivery, and flexible evaluation modes. It operates on distributed cloud architecture leveraging Fastly CDN and AWS infrastructure for sub-100ms global latency.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user session recordings to provide detailed insights into user interactions and behavior patterns.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user engagement through targeted messaging, onboarding flows, and feedback collection mechanisms.

## Product Relationships and Integration

The platform maintains deep integration across all products through shared user identity resolution and unified data collection. Experiment results automatically flow into Analytics for comprehensive performance analysis, while behavioral cohorts computed in Analytics can be used for targeting in Experiments and Guides. The Customer Data Platform (CDP) serves as the central data hub, managing data ingestion, transformation, and distribution across the ecosystem.

Data flows bidirectionally between products through:
- Shared event tracking and user identification systems
- Unified APIs for cross-product data access
- Integrated destination and source catalogs for third-party connections
- Common audience and persona definitions used across experimentation and engagement tools

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events**: Discrete user actions tracked within applications, forming the foundation of all analytics
**Properties**: Attributes associated with events or users that enable segmentation and analysis
**Cohorts**: User segments defined by shared characteristics or behaviors
**Funnels**: Multi-step user journeys tracked to measure conversion rates
**Retention**: Measurement of user return behavior over specified time periods
**Amplitude ID**: Unique user identifier maintained across sessions and devices
**Bucketing Salt**: Unique identifier used in experiment assignment hash generation
**Assignment Events**: Tracking when users are allocated to experiment variants
**Exposure Events**: Recording actual user interaction with experimental features
**mSPRT**: Mixture sequential probability ratio test for continuous statistical inference

## Technical Implementation and APIs

The platform provides extensive API coverage across multiple domains:

**Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/`) supports data ingestion, event tracking, and query execution with endpoints for batch and real-time data processing.

**Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) enable flag management, user assignment, and result analysis with support for both remote and local evaluation modes.

**Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) facilitates in-product messaging and survey deployment.

## SDK Ecosystem

Amplitude maintains comprehensive SDK support across platforms:

**Analytics SDKs** available for Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine, providing consistent event tracking and user identification across all platforms.

**Experiment SDKs** support the same platform matrix with specialized methods:
- `fetch()`: Remote evaluation with automatic assignment tracking
- `evaluate()`: Local evaluation without exposure tracking  
- `variant()`: Local evaluation with automatic exposure generation

**Ampli** provides type-safe analytics implementation with code generation for consistent tracking across development teams.

## Data Management and Integration

The platform's CDP capabilities include:

**Source Catalog**: Pre-built integrations for data ingestion from various platforms and services
**Destination Catalog**: Configured outputs for data distribution to downstream systems
**Audiences**: Computed user segments that can be synced to external platforms
**Data Tables**: Structured data analysis and export capabilities

The system supports both real-time streaming and batch data processing, with automatic schema detection and data validation.

## Advanced Analytics Capabilities

Amplitude provides sophisticated analysis tools through specialized chart types:

**Compass**: Automated insights and anomaly detection
**Journeys**: Visual user path analysis and flow optimization
**Personas**: Behavioral user clustering and segmentation
**Impact Analysis**: Causal inference and experiment impact measurement
**Lifecycle**: User engagement state tracking and transition analysis
**Stickiness**: Feature adoption and usage frequency analysis

## Experimentation and Feature Management

Amplitude Experiment supports complex feature relationships through:
- **Flag Prerequisites**: Hierarchical evaluation chains
- **Mutual Exclusion Groups**: Preventing conflicting experiment assignment
- **Holdout Groups**: Statistical control group management

The randomization system uses murmur3 hash algorithms for deterministic user assignment while maintaining statistical validity through proper traffic allocation and sequential testing methodologies.

## Enterprise Administration

The platform includes comprehensive administrative capabilities covering account management, billing and usage monitoring, single sign-on integration, and user permission management. Organizations can configure custom data retention policies, implement data governance controls, and manage multi-site deployments with localization support including Japanese language options.
