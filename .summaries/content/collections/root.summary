# Amplitude Analytics Platform Documentation

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools for data collection, analysis, experimentation, and customer engagement. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products designed to support the complete analytics lifecycle from data ingestion to actionable insights.

## Core Product Architecture

The Amplitude ecosystem is built around several foundational components that work together to provide end-to-end analytics capabilities:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the core analytics engine, providing chart-based analysis tools including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Cohort Analysis, and specialized charts like Compass, Journeys, and Personas. These analytics tools are accessible through routes like `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/{slug}` and support comprehensive user behavior analysis.

**Amplitude Experiment** is the feature flagging and A/B testing platform that enables controlled feature rollouts and experimentation. It includes advanced techniques, experiment theory, workflow management, and troubleshooting capabilities, accessible through `/feature-experiment/` routes with specialized sections for theory, advanced techniques, and under-the-hood implementation details.

**Amplitude Data (CDP)** functions as the customer data platform, managing data ingestion, transformation, and distribution through source and destination catalogs. It handles data governance, audience creation, and warehouse-native implementations, with routes structured under `/data/` for core functionality and specialized paths for sources, destinations, and audiences.

**Amplitude Session Replay** provides user session recording and analysis capabilities, enabling teams to observe actual user interactions and behaviors within their applications.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** facilitates in-app messaging and user feedback collection, supporting customer engagement and product research initiatives.

## SDK and Integration Ecosystem

The platform provides extensive SDK support across multiple programming languages and platforms:

**Analytics SDKs** include comprehensive implementations for Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine, all accessible through `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/` routes. Each SDK provides platform-specific instrumentation capabilities while maintaining consistent event tracking patterns.

**Experiment SDKs** offer feature flagging capabilities across platforms, accessible through `/sdks/experiment-sdks/` routes, enabling consistent experimentation implementations across different technology stacks.

**Ampli** represents the type-safe analytics code generation platform that creates strongly-typed tracking libraries from Data tracking plans, providing compile-time validation and autocomplete support for analytics implementation.

## API Infrastructure

The platform exposes multiple API layers for programmatic access:

**Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/`) provides programmatic access to event data, user properties, and analytics results, enabling custom integrations and data extraction workflows.

**Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) support feature flag management, experiment configuration, and results retrieval for automated experimentation workflows.

**Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) enables programmatic management of in-app messaging and survey campaigns.

## Data Management and Integration

**Source Catalog** provides pre-built integrations for data ingestion from various platforms and services, categorized by integration types and accessible through `/data/source-catalog/` routes with taxonomy-based organization.

**Destination Catalog** offers data export capabilities to external platforms and services, enabling data activation and cross-platform analytics workflows through `/data/destination-catalog/` routes.

**PII Integrations** handle personally identifiable information with specialized privacy and compliance considerations, accessible through `/data/pii/` routes.

**Warehouse-native Amplitude** enables analytics directly on data warehouse infrastructure, supporting modern data stack architectures through `/data/warehouse-native/` routes.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** provides organizational administration capabilities through `/admin/account-management/` routes, supporting user management, permissions, and organizational settings.

**Single Sign-on** enables enterprise authentication integration through `/admin/single-sign-on/` routes, supporting SAML, OIDC, and other enterprise identity providers.

**Billing and Use** offers usage monitoring and billing management through `/admin/billing-use/` routes, providing cost optimization and usage analytics.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** are discrete user actions tracked within applications, forming the foundation of all analytics analysis and serving as the primary data unit across the platform.

**Properties** are attributes associated with events or users, providing context and enabling segmentation across all analytics and experimentation features.

**Cohorts** represent user segments based on shared characteristics or behaviors, usable across analytics, experimentation, and engagement tools.

**Tracking Plans** define event schemas and validation rules within Amplitude Data, serving as the source of truth for analytics implementation and Ampli code generation.

**Feature Flags** control feature visibility and behavior within applications, managed through Amplitude Experiment for controlled rollouts and A/B testing.

**Destinations** are external platforms and services that receive data from Amplitude, enabling data activation and cross-platform analytics workflows.

**Sources** are external platforms and services that send data to Amplitude, supporting comprehensive data collection strategies.

## Navigation and Content Organization

The documentation is organized around several primary navigation contexts:

- `analytics` - Core analytics features and chart types
- `experiment` - Feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities  
- `data` - Data management, sources, destinations, and CDP features
- `apis` - Programmatic access and integration endpoints
- `analytics_sdks` and `experiment_sdks` - Platform-specific implementation guides
- `admin` - Administrative and enterprise management features
- `get_started` - Onboarding and initial setup guidance
- `faq` - Troubleshooting and frequently asked questions

The platform supports multi-language documentation with English (`en`) as the primary language and Japanese (`jp`) translations available for select content areas. Content is organized with date-based visibility controls, preview capabilities, and structured hierarchies to support both developer and business user needs.

This comprehensive documentation structure reflects Amplitude's position as an enterprise-grade analytics platform that supports the complete product analytics lifecycle from initial instrumentation through advanced experimentation and data activation workflows.
