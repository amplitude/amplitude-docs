## Amplitude Analytics and Experimentation Platform

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools for product analytics, feature experimentation, user engagement, and data management. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products designed to help teams understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and make data-driven decisions.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem is organized around several core product areas that work together to provide end-to-end analytics and experimentation capabilities:

**Analytics Core:**
- **Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational product for behavioral analytics, providing event tracking, user segmentation, and comprehensive charting capabilities
- **Charts** represent the primary analysis interface, including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Revenue LTV, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, and Experiment Results
- **Data Tables** provide raw data exploration capabilities alongside visual analytics

**Experimentation Platform:**
- **Amplitude Experiment** enables feature flagging, A/B testing, and multivariate experimentation with advanced statistical analysis
- **Web Experiment** provides browser-based experimentation capabilities
- **Experiment Theory** covers statistical foundations and best practices
- **Advanced Techniques** and **Under the Hood** sections provide deep technical implementation guidance
- **Workflow** documentation guides users through the complete experimentation lifecycle

**Data Management:**
- **CDP (Customer Data Platform)** functionality manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation
- **Sources** and **Destinations** handle data integration with external systems through extensive catalog offerings
- **Audiences** enable behavioral segmentation and activation across marketing channels
- **Warehouse-native Amplitude** provides direct data warehouse integration

**User Engagement:**
- **Session Replay** captures and analyzes user interaction recordings
- **Guides and Surveys** facilitate in-product user research and onboarding

**Developer Tools:**
- **SDKs** provide instrumentation across multiple platforms (Android, iOS, Browser, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, Unreal)
- **Ampli** offers type-safe analytics implementation with code generation
- **APIs** enable programmatic access to analytics data, experiment management, and platform administration

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Analytics Concepts:**
- **Events** - User actions tracked within applications (page views, clicks, purchases)
- **Properties** - Attributes associated with events (event properties) or users (user properties)
- **Segments** - Filtered subsets of users or events based on specific criteria
- **Cohorts** - Groups of users defined by shared characteristics or behaviors
- **Funnels** - Sequential analysis of user progression through defined steps
- **Retention** - Analysis of user return behavior over time periods
- **LTV (Lifetime Value)** - Revenue attribution and prediction modeling

**Experimentation Terms:**
- **Feature Flags** - Boolean toggles controlling feature availability
- **Variants** - Different versions of features being tested
- **Allocation** - Percentage of users assigned to experiment groups
- **Statistical Significance** - Confidence level in experiment results
- **Lift** - Percentage improvement in key metrics

**Data Management:**
- **Sources** - Systems that send data to Amplitude (mobile apps, websites, servers)
- **Destinations** - External platforms receiving data from Amplitude
- **Transformations** - Data processing rules applied during ingestion
- **Schemas** - Structured definitions of event and property formats
- **Taxonomy** - Organized classification system for events and properties

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Instrumentation** - Code implementation for event tracking
- **SDK (Software Development Kit)** - Platform-specific libraries for data collection
- **API Endpoints** - Programmatic interfaces for data access and management
- **Mount Points** - Content management system references for documentation organization
