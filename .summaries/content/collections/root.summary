Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools for data collection, analysis, feature experimentation, and user engagement. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products designed to support the complete product development and optimization lifecycle.

## Core Product Suite

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics platform, providing event tracking, user behavior analysis, and comprehensive reporting through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, Cohort Analysis, and User Journey mapping. The analytics engine supports real-time data processing and offers advanced features like Compass (automated insights), Personas (behavioral cohorts), and Revenue LTV analysis.

**Amplitude Experiment** is the feature flagging and A/B testing platform that enables controlled feature rollouts and experimentation. It supports both remote and local evaluation methods, with comprehensive SDK coverage across client-side and server-side implementations. The platform includes advanced targeting capabilities, statistical analysis tools, and integration with the broader Amplitude ecosystem.

**Amplitude Session Replay** provides user session recording and playback capabilities, allowing teams to observe actual user interactions and identify usability issues or optimization opportunities.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user engagement through targeted messaging, onboarding flows, and feedback collection mechanisms.

## Data Infrastructure and Integration

The platform operates on a robust **Customer Data Platform (CDP)** architecture that supports data ingestion from multiple sources through an extensive catalog of integrations. The **Source Catalog** includes connectors for various data sources, while the **Destination Catalog** enables data activation across marketing, analytics, and operational tools.

**Warehouse-native Amplitude** allows organizations to run Amplitude analytics directly on their existing data warehouse infrastructure, providing flexibility in data architecture while maintaining analytical capabilities.

The platform supports **Audiences** functionality for creating and managing user segments that can be activated across various destinations for personalized experiences and targeted campaigns.

## SDK and API Ecosystem

Amplitude provides comprehensive instrumentation through multiple SDK categories:

**Analytics SDKs** include platform-specific implementations:
- Browser SDK for web applications
- Mobile SDKs for Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, and Unity
- Server-side SDKs for Node.js, Python, Java, Go, and other backend languages
- Gaming platform SDKs for Unity and Unreal Engine

**Experiment SDKs** mirror the analytics SDK coverage with specialized functionality for feature flagging and experimentation, supporting both client-side and server-side evaluation patterns.

**Ampli** serves as a type-safe wrapper and code generation tool that ensures consistent event tracking implementation across different platforms and programming languages.

## API Infrastructure

The platform exposes functionality through several API categories:

**Analytics APIs** provide programmatic access to event ingestion, data export, and analytical queries, enabling custom integrations and automated workflows.

**Experiment APIs** support programmatic experiment management, flag configuration, and evaluation services for advanced use cases and custom implementations.

**Guides and Surveys API** enables programmatic management of user engagement campaigns and feedback collection workflows.

## Chart Types and Analytical Capabilities

Amplitude Analytics offers a comprehensive suite of visualization and analysis tools:

**Event Segmentation** provides flexible event analysis with multi-dimensional breakdowns and comparative analysis capabilities.

**Funnel Analysis** tracks user progression through defined conversion paths with step-by-step drop-off analysis.

**Retention Analysis** measures user return behavior over time with cohort-based retention curves.

**User Sessions** analyzes session-based metrics and user engagement patterns.

**Journeys** maps user paths and identifies common navigation patterns.

**Lifecycle** categorizes users based on engagement patterns (new, current, dormant, resurrected).

**Stickiness** measures user engagement frequency and habit formation.

**Engagement Matrix** provides a comprehensive view of user engagement across multiple dimensions.

**Impact Analysis** quantifies the effect of specific events or features on key metrics.

**Revenue LTV** analyzes customer lifetime value and revenue attribution.

**Data Tables** offer flexible data exploration with custom queries and exports.

**Experiment Results** provides statistical analysis and visualization of A/B test outcomes.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** provides organizational structure management, user provisioning, and access control mechanisms.

**Single Sign-On** supports enterprise authentication integration with SAML and other identity providers.

**Billing and Use** offers usage monitoring, plan management, and cost optimization tools.

The platform includes comprehensive **FAQ and Troubleshooting** resources, **Migration** tools for transitioning from other analytics platforms, and **Academy Content** for user education and best practices.

## Specialized Features and Advanced Capabilities

**PII Integrations** provide privacy-compliant data handling for personally identifiable information with appropriate governance controls.

**Partners** ecosystem enables extended functionality through third-party integrations and marketplace solutions.

**Advanced Techniques** in experimentation include statistical methodologies, sample size calculations, and sophisticated targeting mechanisms.

**Experiment Theory** covers the statistical foundations and best practices for designing and analyzing experiments.

**Under the Hood** documentation explains the technical implementation details and architectural decisions behind the experimentation platform.

**Workflow** guidance provides structured approaches to experiment design, implementation, and analysis.

The platform supports multi-language capabilities with **Japanese Translation** and localized content, indicating global market focus and international compliance considerations.

**Legacy Charts** maintain backward compatibility with previous analytical implementations while encouraging migration to newer, more capable visualization tools.
