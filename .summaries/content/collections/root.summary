Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with advanced product analytics, feature experimentation, customer data management, and user engagement tools. The platform enables data-driven decision making through sophisticated event tracking, behavioral analysis, and controlled feature rollouts across web, mobile, and server environments.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of four primary product areas: **Amplitude Analytics** for behavioral analytics and user insights, **Amplitude Experiment** for feature flagging and A/B testing, **Amplitude CDP** (Customer Data Platform) for data management and activation, and **Amplitude Session Replay** for user session recording and analysis. These products integrate seamlessly to provide a unified view of user behavior and product performance.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** extends the platform's engagement capabilities by enabling in-product user research and feedback collection, while **Amplitude Agents** provides AI-powered analytics assistance for automated insights and recommendations.

## Analytics and Charting Ecosystem

The analytics platform centers around a comprehensive charting system with specialized visualization types for different analytical use cases:

**Event Segmentation** charts analyze user actions and behaviors across different segments, while **Funnel Analysis** tracks user progression through defined conversion paths. **Retention Analysis** measures user return patterns over time, and **User Sessions** charts provide detailed session-level behavioral insights.

**Lifecycle** charts categorize users into behavioral cohorts (new, current, dormant, resurrected), while **Stickiness** charts measure feature adoption and usage frequency. **Personas** enables behavioral user segmentation, and **Compass** provides metric monitoring and alerting capabilities.

Advanced analytical tools include **Journeys** for path analysis, **Impact Analysis** for measuring feature impact, **Revenue LTV** for customer lifetime value analysis, and **Engagement Matrix** for comprehensive user engagement measurement. **Data Tables** provide raw data access and custom metric calculation capabilities.

## Experimentation and Feature Management

**Amplitude Experiment** operates through two distinct evaluation architectures: **Remote Evaluation** using `fetch()` methods for real-time flag retrieval, and **Local Evaluation** using `start()` methods for client-side evaluation with offline capabilities. The platform includes an **Evaluation Proxy** service for extending local evaluation to unsupported platforms.

**Experiment Theory** encompasses statistical methodologies, sample size calculations, and result interpretation frameworks. **Advanced Techniques** include sequential testing, multi-armed bandits, and sophisticated targeting strategies. **Under the Hood** documentation covers the platform's statistical engines and algorithmic approaches.

**Web Experiment** provides specialized tools for website optimization and conversion rate optimization, while **Experiment Results** charts integrate directly with the analytics platform for comprehensive experiment analysis.

## SDK and Integration Architecture

The platform maintains extensive SDK coverage across development ecosystems:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser SDK (`@amplitude/analytics-browser`), iOS SDK (CocoaPods/Swift Package Manager), Android SDK (Maven Central), React Native SDK, Flutter SDK, Unity SDK, and Unreal SDK for client-side implementations. Server-side SDKs cover Node.js, Python, Java, Go, and other backend environments.

**Experiment SDKs** mirror this coverage with specialized implementations for feature flagging, including client-side and server-side variants optimized for different evaluation patterns and performance requirements.

**Ampli** provides a code-generation framework that creates type-safe analytics implementations based on tracking plans, ensuring data quality and developer productivity across teams.

## Data Management and Customer Data Platform

**Amplitude CDP** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation across the customer journey. **Sources** handle data collection from various platforms and services, while **Destinations** enable data activation to marketing, analytics, and operational tools through the **Destination Catalog**.

**Audiences** provides sophisticated user segmentation capabilities with real-time updates and cross-platform activation. **Warehouse-native Amplitude** enables analytics directly on existing data warehouse infrastructure without data movement.

**PII Integrations** handle personally identifiable information with privacy-compliant processing, while the **Source Catalog** provides pre-built connectors for popular data sources and platforms.

## API Infrastructure

The platform exposes comprehensive REST APIs across all product areas:

**Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/`) provides programmatic access to event data, user properties, and analytical results. **Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) enable flag management, variant assignment, and experiment configuration.

**Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) supports programmatic survey management and response collection, while various product-specific APIs enable custom integrations and workflow automation.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** provides organization-level controls, user permissions, and project governance. **Single Sign-on** supports SAML and OAuth integrations for enterprise authentication requirements.

**Billing and Use** tracking provides detailed usage analytics and cost management tools, while administrative controls enable compliance, data governance, and security policy enforcement.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** represent user actions tracked through the platform, with **Event Properties** providing contextual metadata. **User Properties** define user characteristics, while **Group Properties** enable account-level or organizational analysis.

**Deployment Keys** authenticate SDK implementations and control environment access. **Variants** represent experiment treatments delivered through feature flags, with automatic **Exposure Tracking** for attribution analysis.

**Cohorts** define user segments based on behavioral criteria, with **Cohort Targeting** enabling sophisticated experiment and campaign targeting. **Flag Configurations** contain experiment rules and targeting logic for feature management.

## Routing and URL Structure

The platform uses hierarchical URL structures reflecting product organization:
- `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/{slug}` for analytical tools
- `/feature-experiment/{category}/{slug}` for experimentation features  
- `/sdks/{product}/{platform}/{slug}` for SDK documentation
- `/data/{category}/{slug}` for CDP functionality
- `/apis/{product}/{slug}` for API documentation

## Multi-language and Localization

The platform supports internationalization through **Japanese Translation** collections with dedicated routing (`/{slug}` for Japanese content) and localized navigation structures, indicating global deployment capabilities and regional compliance requirements.

The documentation architecture uses **mount** identifiers for content organization, **preview_targets** for content management workflows, and **injection** parameters for navigation and branding customization across different product areas and user interfaces.
