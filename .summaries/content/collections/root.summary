## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Analytics Concepts:**
- **Events** - User actions or system occurrences tracked in the platform
- **Properties** - Attributes associated with events or users
- **Segments** - Filtered subsets of users or events based on specific criteria
- **Cohorts** - Groups of users who share common characteristics or behaviors
- **Funnels** - Sequential analysis of user progression through defined steps
- **Retention** - Measurement of user return behavior over time
- **Stickiness** - Frequency of user engagement within time periods

**Experimentation Terminology:**
- **Feature Flags** - Boolean toggles for controlling feature availability
- **Variants** - Different versions of features being tested
- **Allocation** - Distribution of users across experiment variants
- **Statistical Significance** - Confidence level in experiment results
- **Lift** - Percentage improvement in key metrics

**Data Management Terms:**
- **Schema** - Structure and validation rules for event data
- **Taxonomy** - Organized classification system for events and properties
- **Governance** - Policies and procedures for data quality and compliance
- **Identity Resolution** - Process of linking user actions across devices and sessions
- **Real-time** - Immediate data processing and availability

**Technical Infrastructure:**
- **SDKs** - Software Development Kits for data collection
- **APIs** - Application Programming Interfaces for system integration
- **Webhooks** - Event-driven notifications to external systems
- **Transformations** - Data processing and enrichment rules

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude platform operates as an integrated ecosystem where products complement and enhance each other:

**Analytics-Experiment Integration:**
- Experiment results automatically flow into Analytics charts
- Analytics insights inform experiment hypothesis generation
- Shared user segmentation across both platforms
- Unified statistical analysis and reporting

**Data Platform Connectivity:**
- CDP serves as the central data hub for all products
- Sources feed data to Analytics, Experiment, and Session Replay
- Audiences created in Analytics can be used for experiment targeting
- Destinations enable data activation across marketing and product tools

**Developer Experience:**
- Unified SDKs provide consistent implementation across products
- Ampli generates type-safe code for both analytics and experimentation
- Shared user identity and session management across all products
- Consistent API patterns and authentication mechanisms

**Enterprise Features:**
- Single Sign-On (SSO) integration across all products
- Unified billing and usage management
- Consistent admin controls and user permissions
- Shared data governance and compliance features
