## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event** - A discrete user action or system occurrence tracked in Amplitude
- **User Properties** - Attributes associated with specific users
- **Event Properties** - Attributes associated with specific events
- **Cohort/Audience** - A group of users who share common characteristics or behaviors
- **Funnel** - A series of steps users take toward a conversion goal
- **Retention** - Measurement of how users continue to engage over time
- **Session** - A period of continuous user engagement
- **Instrumentation** - The process of implementing tracking in applications
- **Source** - An origin point for data imported into Amplitude
- **Destination** - A target system where Amplitude data is exported
- **Experiment** - A controlled test comparing variations of features or experiences
- **SDK (Software Development Kit)** - Client libraries for implementing Amplitude in applications
- **API (Application Programming Interface)** - Programmatic interfaces for interacting with Amplitude
- **Taxonomy** - The organizational structure of events and properties

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude platform is designed as an integrated ecosystem where data flows between components:

1. **Data Collection** - Events are collected through SDKs (Browser, iOS, Android, etc.) or server-side APIs
2. **Data Processing** - Raw events are processed, enriched, and stored in the Amplitude platform
3. **Analysis** - Processed data is made available through various charts and visualization tools
4. **Audience Creation** - Users can be segmented into cohorts based on behavior or properties
5. **Experimentation** - Audiences can be targeted with experiments to test hypotheses
6. **Data Export** - Insights and raw data can be exported to external systems via the Destination Catalog

The platform supports a wide range of integration points with external systems, including data warehouses, marketing platforms, and customer engagement tools.
