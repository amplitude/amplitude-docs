Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools for behavioral analysis, feature experimentation, and data-driven decision making. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Core Product Architecture

The platform operates on a hierarchical structure of organizations, projects, and data sources, with multi-site support (English and Japanese localization). The system provides both client-side and server-side data collection capabilities through extensive SDK libraries and REST APIs. Content is organized into distinct product areas with specialized routing patterns and navigation structures.

**Analytics Core**: The analytics engine provides comprehensive behavioral analysis through multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, Revenue LTV, and Experiment Results. Each chart type offers specialized analysis capabilities with dedicated documentation and configuration options.

**Experimentation Platform**: Amplitude Experiment enables A/B testing and feature flag management through a workflow-driven approach, supporting both statistical experimentation and progressive feature delivery. The system includes advanced techniques, experiment theory, troubleshooting resources, and comprehensive SDK support.

**Data Infrastructure**: The CDP provides data ingestion, transformation, and activation capabilities through source and destination catalogs, audience management, and warehouse-native functionality. The platform supports extensive third-party integrations categorized by integration types.

## Product Relationships and Integration

The products integrate through shared user identity resolution, cross-product data sharing, and unified authentication systems. Analytics data feeds into Experiment for cohort targeting and user enrichment, while Session Replay provides behavioral context for analytics insights. The CDP serves as the data backbone, enabling data flow between products and external systems.

**SDK Ecosystem**: Comprehensive SDK support spans multiple platforms including Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine. Each SDK provides platform-specific implementation guidance with consistent API patterns across languages.

**API Architecture**: The platform exposes REST APIs for Analytics, Experiment, and Guides and Surveys, enabling programmatic access to data ingestion, user management, experiment configuration, and survey deployment. APIs support both real-time and batch operations with comprehensive authentication and rate limiting.
