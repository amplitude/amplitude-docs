Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and optimization platform that provides businesses with advanced tools for understanding user behavior, conducting experiments, and optimizing customer experiences across web, mobile, and server-side applications.

## Core Product Architecture

Amplitude's platform consists of four primary product areas that work together to create a unified digital optimization system:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational behavioral analytics engine, providing real-time event tracking, user journey analysis, and advanced segmentation capabilities through multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Cohort Analysis, and Revenue LTV tracking.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced statistical analysis, supporting both client-side and server-side experimentation workflows with sophisticated targeting and rollout strategies.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and reconstructs user sessions for qualitative analysis, enabling teams to understand the "why" behind behavioral patterns identified in quantitative analytics.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** provides in-product messaging and user feedback collection tools for driving user activation and gathering customer insights.

## Analytics Chart Ecosystem

The analytics platform centers around specialized chart types, each designed for specific analytical use cases:

**Event Segmentation** provides foundational event analysis with advanced filtering, grouping, and comparison capabilities for understanding user actions and their frequency patterns.

**Funnel Analysis** tracks conversion rates through multi-step user journeys, identifying drop-off points and optimization opportunities in critical user flows.

**Retention Analysis** measures user return behavior over time, supporting cohort-based retention tracking and churn analysis for product stickiness optimization.

**User Sessions** analyzes session-based metrics including session duration, events per session, and session-based conversion tracking.

**Journeys** (formerly Pathfinder) visualizes user flow patterns and path analysis, revealing how users navigate through product experiences.

**Personas** creates behavioral user segments based on event patterns and user properties for targeted analysis and activation.

**Compass** provides automated insights and anomaly detection, surfacing significant changes in user behavior and key metrics.

**Revenue LTV** tracks customer lifetime value and revenue attribution, connecting behavioral patterns to business outcomes.

**Impact Analysis** measures the statistical significance of changes in key metrics, supporting data-driven decision making.

**Lifecycle** analyzes user progression through defined lifecycle stages from acquisition to activation to retention.

**Engagement Matrix** and **Stickiness** provide complementary views of user engagement patterns and product usage frequency.

## Data Infrastructure and Integration

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** capabilities enable comprehensive data unification through the Source Catalog, which includes over 70 integrations across data warehouses, marketing platforms, mobile attribution providers, and customer engagement tools.

**Destination Catalog** provides data activation capabilities, enabling behavioral cohorts and insights to be exported to marketing automation platforms, advertising networks, and other business tools.

**Warehouse-native Amplitude** allows organizations to run Amplitude analytics directly on their existing data warehouse infrastructure (Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks) without data movement.

**Audiences** functionality creates and manages user segments based on behavioral patterns, supporting both static and dynamic cohort creation with real-time updates.

## Software Development Kit (SDK) Ecosystem

Amplitude provides comprehensive instrumentation through platform-specific SDKs:

**Analytics SDKs** support all major platforms including Browser (JavaScript), iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine, providing consistent event tracking APIs across client-side and server-side implementations.

**Experiment SDKs** enable feature flag evaluation and experiment participation tracking across the same platform ecosystem, with support for both local and remote evaluation modes.

**Ampli** serves as a type-safe wrapper that generates strongly-typed tracking libraries from Amplitude's Data taxonomy, ensuring consistent implementation across development teams.

## Experimentation Platform

**Amplitude Experiment** provides enterprise-grade feature flagging and experimentation capabilities:

**Advanced Techniques** include sophisticated targeting rules, gradual rollouts, mutual exclusion groups, and multi-armed bandit optimization.

**Experiment Theory** encompasses statistical methodologies including sequential testing, minimum detectable effects, and statistical power calculations.

**Under the Hood** technical documentation covers flag evaluation engines, assignment mechanisms, and performance optimization strategies.

**Workflow** management supports the complete experiment lifecycle from hypothesis formation through statistical analysis to feature rollout decisions.

## API Infrastructure

**Analytics API** provides programmatic access to event ingestion, user identification, and behavioral data export with RESTful endpoints supporting bulk operations and real-time streaming.

**Experiment APIs** enable server-side flag evaluation, experiment configuration management, and results analysis through dedicated endpoints.

**Guides and Surveys API** supports programmatic creation and management of in-product messaging campaigns and user feedback collection.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** provides organization-level controls including user permissions, project management, and cross-project analytics.

**Single Sign-On (SSO)** supports enterprise authentication through SAML and OAuth providers with role-based access controls.

**Billing and Usage** tracking provides transparency into event volume consumption and feature utilization across the platform.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** represent discrete user actions tracked through SDKs, forming the foundational data unit for all analytics and experimentation.

**User Properties** store persistent attributes about users, while **Event Properties** capture contextual information about specific actions.

**Cohorts** are user segments defined by behavioral patterns, demographic attributes, or custom criteria, supporting both inclusion and exclusion logic.

**Feature Flags** control feature visibility and behavior, supporting boolean toggles, string variants, number variants, and JSON configuration objects.

**Variants** represent different experiment treatments, with statistical analysis comparing performance across variant groups.

**Attribution Windows** define time periods for connecting user acquisition events to downstream behavioral patterns and conversions.

## Technical Implementation Patterns

Route structures follow consistent patterns: `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/{slug}` for analytics features, `/sdks/{platform}/{slug}` for SDK documentation, `/apis/{product}/{slug}` for API references, and `/feature-experiment/{category}/{slug}` for experimentation features.

Navigation injection uses standardized identifiers like `analytics`, `experiment_sdks`, `apis`, and `data` to maintain consistent information architecture across the platform.

Mount points connect related content collections, enabling hierarchical documentation organization and cross-referencing between related features and capabilities.

The platform's comprehensive approach to digital optimization combines real-time behavioral analytics, sophisticated experimentation capabilities, and extensive integration ecosystem to support data-driven product development and growth optimization across the complete customer lifecycle.
