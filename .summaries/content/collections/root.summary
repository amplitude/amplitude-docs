Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables product teams to understand user behavior, optimize experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment (A/B testing), Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP), all unified around event-based user behavior tracking and analysis.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem is built around several core products that work together to provide end-to-end user experience optimization:

**Analytics Core**: The foundation product providing event tracking, user segmentation, and behavioral analysis through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Revenue LTV, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Impact Analysis, and Engagement Matrix. Each chart type serves specific analytical use cases, from basic event counting to complex user journey mapping.

**Amplitude Experiment**: A feature flagging and A/B testing platform that integrates with Analytics for statistical analysis. It includes advanced techniques, experiment theory, workflow management, and comprehensive results analysis capabilities.

**Session Replay**: User session recording and analysis tool that captures user interactions for qualitative insights, complementing quantitative analytics data.

**Guides and Surveys**: In-product user experience platform for onboarding, engagement, and feedback collection through contextual guides and surveys.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)**: Data management layer including Sources, Destinations, Audiences, and warehouse-native capabilities for data integration and activation.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Analytics Concepts**:
- **Events**: User actions tracked within applications (clicks, page views, purchases, etc.)
- **Properties**: Attributes associated with events (user properties, event properties, group properties)
- **Cohorts/Audiences**: User segments based on behavioral criteria or properties
- **Funnels**: Sequential user journey analysis showing conversion rates between steps
- **Retention**: Analysis of user return behavior over time periods
- **Lifecycle**: User state classification (New, Current, Dormant, Resurrected)

**Experimentation Terminology**:
- **Feature Flags**: Boolean toggles controlling feature visibility
- **Variants**: Different versions of features being tested
- **Bucketing Units**: User identification method for consistent experiment assignment
- **Statistical Significance**: Confidence level in experiment results
- **Multi-armed Bandit**: Dynamic traffic allocation based on performance

**Data Management**:
- **Sources**: Data input connectors from various platforms and applications
- **Destinations**: Data output connectors to external tools and platforms
- **Transformations**: Data processing rules applied during ingestion
- **Real-time/Batch Processing**: Different data processing modes based on latency requirements

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates extensively with external platforms through its source and destination catalogs, supporting hundreds of integrations across categories including advertising, analytics, attribution, CRM, data warehouses, email marketing, and more. The platform supports both real-time and batch data processing, with APIs enabling custom integrations.

**Multi-site Architecture**: The platform supports multiple deployment regions (en, jp) with localization capabilities and site-specific content propagation.

**Partner Ecosystem**: Extensive partner network providing specialized integrations and consulting services for implementation and optimization.

**Enterprise Features**: Advanced capabilities including Single Sign-On (SSO), account management, billing controls, PII handling, and warehouse-native deployments for enterprise customers.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Analytics APIs**: RESTful APIs at `/apis/analytics/{endpoint}` for programmatic data access, custom reporting, and integration with external systems.

**Experiment APIs**: Dedicated endpoints at `/apis/experiment/{endpoint}` for feature flag management, experiment configuration, and results retrieval.

**Guides and Surveys API**: Endpoints at `/apis/guides-and-surveys/{endpoint}` for managing in-product experiences and survey data.

**SDK Implementation**: Comprehensive SDK catalog supporting multiple platforms:
- **Web**: Browser SDK with JavaScript implementation
- **Mobile**: iOS (Swift), Android (Java/Kotlin), React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal
- **Server-side**: Node.js, Python, Java, Go for backend event tracking
- **Ampli**: Type-safe SDK wrapper providing compile-time validation

**Route Structure**: Hierarchical URL organization with product-specific paths:
- `/analytics/{feature}` - Analytics features and charts
- `/feature-experiment/{section}` - Experiment platform sections
- `/data/{component}` - CDP and data management features
- `/sdks/{platform}/{sdk}` - SDK documentation and implementation guides
- `/admin/{function}` - Administrative and account management features

The platform emphasizes developer experience through comprehensive documentation, migration guides, troubleshooting resources, and getting started workflows, with specialized content for different user roles and technical proficiency levels.
