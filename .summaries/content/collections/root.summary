Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that empowers product teams to understand user behavior, optimize experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products that provide end-to-end capabilities for analytics, experimentation, customer data management, and user engagement.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform is built around several key products that work together to provide a complete analytics and optimization solution:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, providing behavioral analytics capabilities through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Impact Analysis, Revenue LTV, and Engagement Matrix. Each chart type offers specialized insights into different aspects of user behavior and business performance.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities, encompassing experiment theory, advanced techniques, workflow management, and comprehensive troubleshooting. The platform supports sophisticated experimentation methodologies with detailed result analysis and statistical rigor.

**Amplitude CDP (Customer Data Platform)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation through Sources, Destinations, Audiences, and warehouse-native capabilities. The CDP includes extensive catalog integrations for both data sources and destinations, enabling comprehensive data ecosystem connectivity.

**Amplitude Session Replay** provides visual user session recordings and analysis capabilities, offering detailed insights into user interactions and experience optimization opportunities.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** delivers in-product user engagement through contextual guides, feedback collection surveys, and integrated resource centers that enhance onboarding, retention, and user experience.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

The platform employs specific terminology across its products:

- **Events**: User actions tracked within applications, forming the foundation of all analytics
- **Properties**: Attributes associated with events or users that enable segmentation and analysis
- **Cohorts/Audiences**: User segments defined by behavioral patterns or characteristics
- **Funnels**: Sequential user journey analysis showing conversion rates between steps
- **Retention**: Measurement of user return behavior over specified time periods
- **Lifecycle**: User state classification (New, Current, Resurrected, Dormant)
- **Stickiness**: Frequency of user engagement within defined time windows
- **Personas**: Behavioral user clustering based on action patterns
- **Variants**: Different versions of features or experiences used in experiments
- **Feature Flags**: Configuration controls that enable/disable features for specific user segments
- **Sources**: Data input connections from various platforms and applications
- **Destinations**: Data output connections to external tools and platforms
- **Transformations**: Data processing rules applied during ingestion or export

## SDK and API Implementation

The platform provides comprehensive instrumentation capabilities through multiple SDKs and APIs:

**Analytics SDKs** support all major platforms including Browser (JavaScript), iOS (Swift), Android (Kotlin/Java), React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal, Node.js, Python, Java, and Go. Each SDK provides platform-specific implementation patterns while maintaining consistent event tracking methodologies.

**Experiment SDKs** enable feature flag evaluation and experiment participation across the same platform ecosystem, with real-time flag resolution and local evaluation capabilities.

**Ampli** serves as a type-safe wrapper that generates strongly-typed tracking libraries based on defined tracking plans, ensuring data quality and consistency across implementations.

**APIs** include the Analytics API for event ingestion and data export (`/apis/analytics/`), Experiment APIs for flag management and evaluation (`/apis/experiment/`), and Guides and Surveys API for experience management (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`).

## Data Management and Integration

The platform's data architecture supports comprehensive data lifecycle management:

**Data Ingestion** occurs through the Source Catalog, which includes pre-built integrations with popular platforms, custom API connections, and warehouse imports. Sources are categorized by integration type and provide standardized data mapping.

**Data Processing** includes real-time event processing, data validation, transformation capabilities, and PII (Personally Identifiable Information) handling with privacy controls.

**Data Export** operates through the Destination Catalog, enabling data activation across marketing, analytics, and operational tools. Destinations support both real-time streaming and batch export patterns.

**Warehouse-native Amplitude** provides direct connectivity to cloud data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift), enabling analysis of existing data without migration requirements.

## Advanced Analytics Capabilities

The platform offers sophisticated analysis methodologies:

**Behavioral Analysis** through Event Segmentation enables multi-dimensional analysis of user actions with advanced filtering, grouping, and comparison capabilities.

**Conversion Analysis** via Funnel Analysis provides step-by-step conversion tracking with cohort analysis, time-to-convert metrics, and drop-off identification.

**Retention Analysis** measures user return patterns with flexible time windows, cohort comparisons, and retention curve analysis.

**Journey Analysis** maps user paths through applications, identifying common flows, drop-off points, and optimization opportunities.

**Revenue Analysis** through Revenue LTV charts provides customer lifetime value calculations, revenue attribution, and monetization insights.

**Predictive Analytics** via Compass delivers automated insights, anomaly detection, and trend identification using machine learning algorithms.

## Experimentation Framework

Amplitude Experiment provides enterprise-grade experimentation capabilities:

**Experiment Design** supports A/B tests, multivariate tests, and multi-armed bandit algorithms with statistical power calculations and sample size recommendations.

**Feature Flag Management** enables gradual rollouts, instant rollbacks, and targeted feature releases with real-time configuration updates.

**Statistical Analysis** includes sequential testing, Bayesian analysis, and multiple comparison corrections to ensure reliable results.

**Advanced Techniques** encompass holdout groups, interaction effects, and long-term impact measurement for comprehensive experiment evaluation.

## Enterprise Features and Administration

The platform includes comprehensive enterprise capabilities:

**Account Management** provides organization-level controls, user provisioning, and access management with role-based permissions.

**Single Sign-On (SSO)** supports SAML and OAuth integrations with enterprise identity providers.

**Billing and Usage** monitoring includes real-time usage tracking, quota management, and cost optimization tools.

**Data Governance** features include data retention policies, privacy controls, and compliance frameworks (GDPR, CCPA).

## Migration and Integration Support

The platform facilitates migration from other analytics providers through:

**Migration Guides** for transitioning from Google Analytics, Mixpanel, and other platforms with data mapping assistance and implementation guidance.

**Partner Integrations** through the Partners catalog, providing pre-built connections and certified implementation support.

**Professional Services** including implementation consulting, training programs, and ongoing optimization support.

The Amplitude platform represents a comprehensive solution for product analytics and optimization, providing the tools and infrastructure necessary for data-driven product development and user experience optimization across the entire product lifecycle.
