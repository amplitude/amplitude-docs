Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform combines behavioral analytics, A/B testing, customer data management, and activation capabilities into an integrated ecosystem designed for product teams, marketers, and data professionals.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

Amplitude's ecosystem consists of four core products that work together to provide end-to-end analytics and optimization capabilities:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational behavioral analytics engine, offering sophisticated event-based tracking through multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, and specialized visualizations like Compass, Personas, and Journeys. The platform supports both individual user analysis and account-level reporting through group analytics, enabling organizations to analyze behavior across different aggregation levels.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides A/B testing and feature flagging capabilities with advanced statistical methodologies including sequential testing, mutual exclusion groups, and sophisticated targeting through behavioral cohorts. The platform integrates directly with Analytics data to enable experiment analysis and measurement.

**Amplitude Data** functions as the governance and schema management layer, providing tracking plan creation, type-safe code generation through Ampli, data quality monitoring, and transformation capabilities. This product ensures data integrity and enables collaborative development workflows across teams.

**Supporting Products** include Session Replay for qualitative user session analysis, Guides and Surveys for in-product user engagement, and a comprehensive destination catalog for data activation across marketing and engagement platforms.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Data Concepts:**
- **Events**: Discrete user actions tracked with associated properties (e.g., "Button Clicked", "Purchase Completed")
- **User Properties**: Attributes describing user characteristics that persist across sessions
- **Event Properties**: Contextual data specific to individual event instances
- **Group Properties**: Account or organization-level attributes for B2B analytics
- **Behavioral Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments based on actions and properties
- **Sessions**: Grouped user events within configurable time boundaries

**Identity Management:**
- **User ID**: Customer-defined identifier for known users
- **Device ID**: Platform-specific anonymous identifier (Android UUID, iOS IDFV)
- **Amplitude ID**: Internal identifier for user tracking across devices
- **Group Types/Values**: Hierarchical organization structure for account-level analysis

**Analytics Infrastructure:**
- **Monthly Tracked Users (MTU)**: Primary billing metric based on unique users per month
- **Tracking Plans**: Comprehensive schemas defining events, properties, and validation rules
- **Transformations**: Retroactive data modifications including event merging and property derivation
- **Lookup Tables**: CSV-based property enrichment for event and user data

**Experimentation Framework:**
- **Feature Flags**: Boolean toggles for feature rollouts and targeting
- **Variants**: Different versions of features or experiences in experiments
- **Allocation**: Percentage of users exposed to experiments
- **Mutual Exclusion Groups**: Preventing cross-experiment contamination
- **Sequential Testing**: Statistical methodology providing always-valid p-values

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates across the modern product and marketing technology stack through multiple integration patterns:

**Data Ingestion Layer** supports various SDKs (JavaScript, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity), server-side APIs (HTTP V2, Batch Upload), and third-party integrations including Segment, attribution partners (Appsflyer, Adjust, Branch), and warehouse imports from Snowflake, BigQuery, and Databricks.

**Collaboration Infrastructure** includes Dashboards for combining analytical views, Notebooks for report creation, Spaces for team organization, and integrations with Slack, Confluence, Jira, Notion, and Google Workspace for seamless workflow integration.

**Data Activation** through the destination catalog enables behavioral data export to over 100 platforms including marketing automation (Braze, Customer.io, Klaviyo), advertising networks (Facebook, Google, TikTok), experimentation platforms (Optimizely, LaunchDarkly), and data warehouses for comprehensive activation workflows.

**Enterprise Features** provide advanced security and governance including SSO integration, SCIM provisioning, role-based permissions, Data Access Control (DAC) for PII classification, and compliance with SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA requirements.
