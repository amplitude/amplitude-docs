# Amplitude Product Documentation Suite

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides businesses with tools to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment (A/B testing), Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Core Product Architecture

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational product, providing event-based behavioral analytics through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, Lifecycle charts, Journeys, User Sessions, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Stickiness, Impact Analysis, Revenue LTV, and Engagement Matrix. Each chart type offers specialized analysis capabilities for different aspects of user behavior and business metrics.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced statistical analysis, supporting experiment design, results interpretation, and advanced techniques for sophisticated testing scenarios. The product includes comprehensive troubleshooting resources and integrates with the broader Amplitude ecosystem.

**Session Replay** captures and analyzes user interactions to provide visual insights into user experience issues and optimization opportunities.

**Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user engagement through targeted messaging and feedback collection mechanisms.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation across the entire customer data ecosystem, including source and destination catalogs, audience management, and warehouse-native capabilities.

## SDK and Integration Ecosystem

The platform supports comprehensive data collection through multiple SDK implementations:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser SDK, Android SDK, iOS SDK, React Native SDK, Flutter SDK, Node.js SDK, Python SDK, Java SDK, Go SDK, Unity SDK, and Unreal SDK, each optimized for their respective platforms and development environments.

**Experiment SDKs** provide feature flagging capabilities across all major platforms with consistent APIs and configuration patterns.

**Ampli** serves as a code generation tool that creates type-safe analytics implementations from Amplitude Data tracking plans, ensuring schema compliance and reducing implementation errors.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events and Properties**: Events represent user actions tracked with structured data, while event properties provide contextual information. User properties describe user characteristics and persist across sessions.

**User Identification System**: Utilizes a three-tier approach with device IDs for anonymous tracking, Amplitude IDs for cross-device reconciliation, and user IDs for authenticated user identification.

**Sessions**: Time-bounded periods of user activity with platform-specific timeout configurations (typically 5 minutes for mobile, 30 minutes for web).

**Behavioral Cohorts**: User segments based on shared behaviors or characteristics, enabling advanced targeting and analysis.

**Autocapture**: Automatic event tracking functionality that captures page views, clicks, form interactions, and other user behaviors without manual instrumentation.

**API Keys**: Project-specific identifiers that route events to the correct Amplitude project and control data access permissions.

**Tracking Plans**: Schema definitions in Amplitude Data that specify event structures, property types, and validation rules for consistent data collection.

## API Endpoints and Integration Points

**Analytics APIs** include:
- HTTP API v2 for event ingestion with deduplication capabilities
- Identify API for user property updates
- Dashboard REST API for programmatic dashboard management
- Export API for data extraction
- Behavioral Cohorts API for segment management
- Batch API for bulk operations

**Experiment APIs** provide:
- Feature flag evaluation endpoints
- Experiment configuration management
- Results retrieval and analysis APIs

**Guides and Surveys API** enables:
- Campaign management and targeting
- Response collection and analysis
- Integration with external systems

## Command Line Interfaces

**Ampli CLI** provides:
- `ampli pull`: Downloads tracking plans and generates type-safe code
- `ampli status`: Validates implementation compliance with tracking plans

## Data Management and Compliance

The platform supports data residency requirements with US and EU server zones, implements GDPR and CCPA compliance features, and provides comprehensive data governance tools including PII management, data retention controls, and privacy-focused configurations.

**Storage Options** include cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage, and cookieless implementations to accommodate various privacy requirements and technical constraints.

**Attribution Models** support first-touch, multi-touch, and custom attribution methodologies for marketing campaign analysis.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** encompasses user provisioning, role-based access control, and organization-level settings management.

**Single Sign-On (SSO)** integration supports SAML and OAuth providers for enterprise authentication requirements.

**Billing and Usage** monitoring provides visibility into event volumes, user counts, and feature utilization across the platform.

## Migration and Legacy Support

The platform maintains comprehensive migration paths between SDK versions and provides legacy chart support for backward compatibility. Migration documentation covers API changes, configuration updates, and best practices for transitioning between product versions.

## Broader Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates with numerous third-party platforms through its destination catalog, supports warehouse-native architectures for data teams, and provides partner integrations for extended functionality. The platform's agent-based architecture enables custom data processing and transformation workflows.

The documentation structure reflects Amplitude's evolution from a single analytics product to a comprehensive digital optimization platform, with clear separation between product areas while maintaining integration points that enable unified customer experiences across the entire user journey.
