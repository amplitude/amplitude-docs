# Amplitude Product Ecosystem

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics platform that helps businesses understand user behavior, optimize experiences, and drive growth. The platform consists of several interconnected products and features that collectively enable data collection, analysis, experimentation, and personalization.

Key features across the platform include:
- Analytics and visualization tools for understanding user behavior
- SDKs for multiple platforms (Web, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, etc.)
- Experimentation capabilities for A/B testing
- Data management and integration tools
- Personalization through audience targeting

## Product Relationships and Structure

The Amplitude ecosystem consists of several core products that work together:

1. **Analytics** - The foundation of the platform, providing event tracking, visualization, and insights
   - Charts (Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, etc.)
   - Session Replay for visual session recordings
   - Dashboards and reporting

2. **Experiment** - A/B testing and feature experimentation platform
   - Experiment design and targeting
   - Results analysis and impact measurement
   - Integration with analytics for deeper insights

3. **CDP (Customer Data Platform)** - Data management and audience building
   - Audience creation and segmentation
   - Data sources and destinations
   - Identity resolution

4. **SDKs and Instrumentation** - Implementation tools for various platforms
   - Platform-specific SDKs (Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, etc.)
   - Ampli (code generation for type-safe analytics)
   - Server-side SDKs (Node.js, Python, Java, Go)

5. **Data Management**
   - Sources (data ingestion)
   - Destinations (data export)
   - Audiences (user segmentation)
   - PII management

6. **Admin and Account Management**
   - Billing and usage
   - Single Sign-On
   - User management

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event** - A user action or system occurrence tracked in Amplitude
- **User/Device ID** - Unique identifiers for tracking individual users across sessions
- **Session** - A period of continuous user activity
- **Funnel** - A sequence of events representing a user journey
- **Retention** - Measurement of users returning to the product over time
- **Cohort** - A group of users who share common characteristics
- **Experiment** - A controlled test comparing variations of features
- **Audience** - A segment of users defined by specific criteria
- **Source** - A data provider that sends information to Amplitude
- **Destination** - A system that receives data from Amplitude
- **SDK (Software Development Kit)** - Libraries for implementing Amplitude in applications
- **Ampli** - Code generation tool for type-safe analytics implementation

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude platform is designed as an integrated ecosystem:

1. **Data Collection Layer**
   - SDKs capture events from various platforms
   - Sources bring in data from external systems
   - APIs enable custom integrations

2. **Data Processing Layer**
   - Event processing and enrichment
   - Identity resolution
   - Data transformation

3. **Analysis and Action Layer**
   - Analytics for insights
   - Experiment for testing
   - CDP for audience activation
   - Destinations for data export

4. **Administration Layer**
   - Account management
   - Billing and usage monitoring
   - Access control and SSO

## API Endpoints and Implementation

### SDK Implementation Examples

**Browser SDK:**
```javascript
import * as amplitude from '@amplitude/analytics-browser';
amplitude.init('API_KEY');
amplitude.track('Button Clicked');
```

**iOS SDK:**
```swift
import AmplitudeSwift
let amplitude = Amplitude(configuration: Configuration(apiKey: "API_KEY"))
amplitude.track(event: BaseEvent(eventType: "Button Clicked"))
```

**Android SDK:**
```kotlin
import com.amplitude.android.Amplitude
val amplitude = Amplitude(Configuration(apiKey = "API_KEY", context = applicationContext))
amplitude.track("Button Clicked")
```

**Ampli SDK (Generated Code):**
```javascript
import { ampli } from './ampli';
ampli.init();
ampli.buttonClicked({
  buttonName: "Submit",
  buttonColor: "blue"
});
```

### API Endpoints

The platform provides several APIs for different purposes:

1. **HTTP API** - For sending events server-side:
   - Endpoint: `https://api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`
   - Method: POST

2. **Export API** - For retrieving data:
   - Endpoint: `https://amplitude.com/api/2/export`
   - Method: GET

3. **Experiment API** - For fetching experiment variants:
   - Endpoint: `https://api.lab.amplitude.com/v1/vardata`
   - Method: GET

4. **User Profile API** - For managing user profiles:
   - Endpoint: `https://api.amplitude.com/2/userprofile`
   - Method: POST

The documentation is organized into product-specific sections, with detailed guides for implementation, usage, and troubleshooting across all components of the Amplitude ecosystem.
