Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, optimize experiences, and make data-driven decisions. The platform consists of four core products: Analytics for behavioral analysis, Data for tech stack integration, Experiment for A/B testing and optimization, and Session Replay for reconstructing digital user experiences.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem is built around a unified data foundation that connects multiple specialized products. Analytics serves as the core behavioral analytics engine, while Data handles integration with existing tech stacks and data warehouses. Experiment leverages the analytics foundation to run sophisticated A/B tests and feature flag experiments, and Session Replay provides visual context to quantitative insights by reconstructing user interactions.

The platform supports both client-side and server-side implementations through comprehensive SDKs and APIs. The JavaScript SDK handles browser-based tracking with session replay capabilities, while mobile SDKs (including Swift) provide native app analytics. All products share common data models for users, events, and properties, ensuring consistency across the platform.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Data Concepts:**
- **Events**: User actions tracked within applications (clicks, page views, purchases)
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes describing users (demographics, subscription status)
- **Event Properties**: Contextual data specific to individual events (product category, page URL)
- **user_id**: Persistent identifier for authenticated users across sessions
- **device_id**: Anonymous identifier for tracking users before authentication

**Experimentation Terminology:**
- **Feature Flags**: Configuration switches that control feature availability and behavior
- **Treatment Variants**: Different versions of features being tested in experiments
- **Control Groups**: Baseline groups used for comparison in A/B tests
- **Sequential Testing**: Statistical methodology using mixture sequential probability ratio test (mSPRT)
- **Conversion Rate Testing**: Experiments measuring binary outcome metrics

**Technical Components:**
- **Session Replay Browser Package** (@amplitude/session-replay-browser): Client-side recording of user interactions
- **Remote Configuration** (fetchRemoteConfig): Dynamic feature flag and experiment configuration retrieval
- **Autocapture**: Automatic tracking of user interactions without manual instrumentation

## Platform Integration and Ecosystem

Amplitude integrates into broader product ecosystems through multiple touchpoints. The Data product facilitates warehouse integrations, allowing organizations to combine Amplitude insights with existing business intelligence tools. SDKs support initialization patterns that accommodate various development frameworks and deployment strategies.

The platform uses a CDN-based delivery system (cdn.amplitude.com) for SDK distribution and configuration management. This architecture supports real-time feature flag updates and experiment configuration changes without requiring application deployments.

## Technical Implementation

**SDK Initialization Patterns:**
- JavaScript: `amplitude.init()` with API key configuration and optional autocapture settings
- Swift: `amplitudeEngagement.boot()` using AmplitudeBootOptions for user and device configuration

**Statistical Methodology:**
The Experiment product implements advanced statistical techniques including mSPRT for sequential testing, which provides advantages over traditional T-tests by allowing continuous monitoring of experiment results while maintaining statistical rigor. The system handles both binary metrics (conversion rates) and continuous metrics, with built-in outlier detection and Central Limit Theorem applications.

**Data Architecture:**
The platform maintains separation between user identification (user_id for authenticated users, device_id for anonymous tracking) and supports property hierarchies that distinguish between persistent user attributes and contextual event data. This structure enables sophisticated segmentation and analysis while maintaining data integrity across the customer journey.
