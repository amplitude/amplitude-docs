Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that provides end-to-end solutions for data collection, analysis, feature experimentation, and customer engagement. The platform consists of several interconnected products designed to help organizations understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven decision making.

## Core Product Architecture

The Amplitude ecosystem is built around four primary products that work together to provide a complete analytics and optimization solution:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational product analytics platform, offering advanced behavioral analytics capabilities through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Stickiness, Lifecycle, Personas, Compass, Impact Analysis, Revenue LTV, Engagement Matrix, Data Tables, and Experiment Results. The platform supports real-time data processing and provides sophisticated user behavior analysis tools.

**Amplitude Experiment** is the feature flagging and A/B testing platform that enables teams to safely deploy features, run experiments, and measure impact. It includes advanced techniques for experimentation, comprehensive experiment theory documentation, workflow management, troubleshooting capabilities, and "under the hood" technical implementation details.

**Amplitude Data** functions as the data governance and management layer, providing tracking plan creation, schema validation, data quality monitoring, and integration management across the entire data ecosystem.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and replays user sessions to provide qualitative insights into user behavior, complementing the quantitative analytics data.

Additional specialized products include **Amplitude Guides and Surveys** for in-product user engagement and feedback collection, and **Web Experiment** for web-specific experimentation capabilities.

## SDK and Integration Ecosystem

The platform provides comprehensive instrumentation capabilities through multiple SDK categories:

**Analytics SDKs** support all major platforms including Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal, Node.js, Python, Java, and Go, with each SDK offering platform-specific optimizations and features.

**Experiment SDKs** provide feature flagging and experimentation capabilities across the same platform ecosystem, ensuring consistent experiment delivery regardless of implementation environment.

**Ampli** serves as a type-safe wrapper system that generates code based on tracking plans, providing compile-time validation and preventing instrumentation errors across all supported platforms.

The platform also includes specialized integrations for agents, partners, and various third-party tools through comprehensive source and destination catalogs with integration categorization and filtering capabilities.

## Data Management and Governance

Amplitude's data architecture supports multiple ingestion methods and provides robust governance capabilities:

**Data Sources** include client-side SDKs, server-side SDKs, HTTP APIs, batch upload capabilities, and extensive third-party integrations. The platform supports both real-time streaming and batch data processing.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** functionality includes audience creation and management, destination event streaming, warehouse-native capabilities for Snowflake and other data warehouses, and comprehensive data transformation tools.

**Data Quality and Governance** features include PII handling, data access controls, schema validation, and comprehensive audit trails. The platform provides specialized tools for managing sensitive data and ensuring compliance with privacy regulations.

## Analytics and Visualization

The analytics platform provides sophisticated analysis capabilities through various chart types, each designed for specific analytical use cases:

**Behavioral Analysis Charts** include Event Segmentation for analyzing user actions, Funnel Analysis for conversion optimization, Retention Analysis for understanding user stickiness, and User Sessions for session-based analysis.

**Advanced Analytics** encompasses Journeys for path analysis, Personas for user segmentation, Compass for metric monitoring, Impact Analysis for measuring feature impact, and Revenue LTV for financial analysis.

**Legacy and Specialized Charts** provide backward compatibility and specialized analysis capabilities for specific use cases.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

The platform includes comprehensive administrative capabilities:

**Account Management** provides user management, permissions, and organizational controls with support for single sign-on (SSO) integration and enterprise security requirements.

**Billing and Usage Management** includes usage monitoring, plan management, and cost optimization tools.

**Administrative Controls** encompass project management, data governance policies, and compliance tools necessary for enterprise deployments.

## Developer and API Ecosystem

Amplitude provides extensive API coverage across all product areas:

**Analytics APIs** enable programmatic access to data, chart creation, and analysis capabilities.

**Experiment APIs** provide feature flag management, experiment configuration, and results retrieval.

**Guides and Surveys APIs** enable programmatic management of in-product engagement tools.

The platform supports various authentication methods, rate limiting, and comprehensive error handling across all API endpoints.

## Documentation and Support Structure

The documentation architecture includes:

**Getting Started** materials for onboarding new users and implementing basic functionality.

**Migration Guides** for transitioning from other analytics platforms or upgrading between Amplitude versions.

**FAQ and Troubleshooting** resources providing solutions to common implementation and usage challenges.

**Academy Content** offering educational materials and best practices for analytics implementation and optimization.

The platform supports multiple languages with Japanese translation capabilities and provides specialized content for different user personas and use cases.

## Key Technical Concepts

**Instrumentation** refers to the process of implementing tracking code and defining what events and properties to collect.

**Collections** represent organized groupings of related documentation and functionality within the platform.

**Routes** define URL structures for accessing different parts of the platform and documentation.

**Navigation Titles** provide organizational structure for the user interface and documentation hierarchy.

**Preview Targets** enable content preview and testing capabilities within the documentation system.

**Mount Points** connect different content collections and provide hierarchical organization.

**Injection Parameters** customize behavior and appearance of different sections and features.

The platform operates on a multi-site architecture supporting different locales (English, Japanese) with content propagation and site-specific customization capabilities.
