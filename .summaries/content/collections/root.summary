Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools for data-driven decision making through analytics, feature experimentation, customer data management, and user engagement optimization. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products that work together to provide end-to-end insights into user behavior and product performance.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

The Amplitude ecosystem is built around several core products that integrate seamlessly:

**Analytics Core:**
- **Charts and Visualization**: Multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Personas, Stickiness, Compass, Data Tables, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Revenue LTV, and Experiment Results
- **Data Foundation**: Customer Data Platform (CDP) with Sources, Destinations, Audiences, and Warehouse-native capabilities
- **Session Replay**: Visual user session recording and analysis integrated with analytics data

**Experimentation Platform:**
- **Amplitude Experiment**: Feature flagging and A/B testing with advanced techniques, experiment theory, workflow management, and troubleshooting capabilities
- **Web Experiment**: Browser-based experimentation tools
- **Results Integration**: Experiment results charts that connect directly to analytics data

**Developer Tools and SDKs:**
- **Analytics SDKs**: Platform-specific implementations for Android, iOS, Browser, Flutter, Go, Java, Node.js, Python, React Native, Unity, and Unreal
- **Experiment SDKs**: Dedicated experimentation SDKs for feature flag management
- **Ampli**: Type-safe analytics wrapper for consistent event tracking across platforms

**Data Management:**
- **Sources and Destinations**: Extensive catalog of integrations for data ingestion and activation
- **PII Management**: Privacy-focused data handling capabilities
- **Warehouse Integration**: Native support for data warehouse architectures

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Analytics Terminology:**
- **Events**: User actions tracked within applications (clicks, page views, purchases)
- **Properties**: Attributes associated with events or users that provide context
- **Cohorts**: Groups of users defined by shared characteristics or behaviors
- **Funnels**: Sequential steps users take toward conversion goals
- **Retention**: Measurement of user return behavior over time periods
- **Stickiness**: Frequency of user engagement within specific time windows

**Experimentation Concepts:**
- **Feature Flags**: Boolean toggles that control feature visibility and behavior
- **Variants**: Different versions of features or experiences in experiments
- **Bucketing**: Process of assigning users to experiment groups
- **Holdout Groups**: Control populations excluded from experiments for baseline measurement
- **Mutual Exclusion**: Prevention of users from participating in multiple related experiments

**Data Management:**
- **Taxonomy**: Standardized event and property naming conventions
- **Schema**: Structure defining expected data formats and validation rules
- **Destinations**: Third-party platforms receiving Amplitude data
- **Transformations**: Data processing rules applied during ingestion or export

**Platform Architecture:**
- **Mount Points**: Content management system references (UUIDs) linking collections to specific content trees
- **Collections**: Organized groupings of documentation and features by product area
- **Injection**: Metadata added to content for navigation and branding purposes
- **Propagation**: Multi-site content distribution settings

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude operates as a unified platform where products complement each other:

**Analytics-First Architecture:**
All products feed into and leverage the core analytics engine, ensuring consistent data models and user identification across touchpoints. Session Replay provides visual context to quantitative analytics data, while Experiment Results charts surface A/B test performance directly within the analytics interface.

**Developer Experience:**
The SDK ecosystem ensures consistent implementation patterns across platforms, with Ampli providing type safety and validation. The API structure supports both real-time and batch data processing, accommodating different architectural needs.

**Enterprise Integration:**
- Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities for enterprise authentication
- Account Management tools for user provisioning and access control
- Billing and Usage monitoring for cost management
- Partner ecosystem for extended functionality

**Data Activation:**
The CDP capabilities enable data to flow bidirectionally - ingesting from various sources and activating insights through destination integrations, creating closed-loop optimization workflows.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Core API Structure:**
- `/apis/analytics/{slug}` - Analytics API endpoints for data querying and manipulation
- `/apis/experiment/{slug}` - Experiment API for feature flag management and variant assignment
- `/apis/guides-and-surveys/{slug}` - User engagement and feedback collection APIs

**SDK Routes:**
- `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/{slug}` - Platform-specific analytics SDK documentation and implementation guides
- `/sdks/experiment-sdks/{slug}` - Experimentation SDK resources
- `/sdks/ampli/{slug}` - Type-safe analytics implementation tools

**Data Management Endpoints:**
- `/data/source-catalog/{slug}` - Available data source integrations
- `/data/destination-catalog/{slug}` - Data activation and export destinations
- `/data/audiences/{slug}` - User segmentation and cohort management
- `/data/warehouse-native/{slug}` - Data warehouse integration capabilities

**Administrative Functions:**
- `/admin/account-management/{slug}` - User and organization management
- `/admin/billing-use/{slug}` - Usage monitoring and billing administration
- `/admin/single-sign-on/{slug}` - Enterprise authentication configuration

**Content Organization:**
The platform uses a hierarchical route structure with collections mapped to specific product areas. Each collection includes metadata for navigation injection, preview capabilities, and content lifecycle management through date-based visibility controls.

**Multi-language Support:**
The platform supports internationalization with dedicated collections for Japanese translations (`sites: jp`) and English content (`sites: en`), with propagation controls for content distribution across regions.

**Integration Categories:**
Source and destination catalogs use taxonomies for categorizing integrations, enabling users to discover relevant tools based on their technology stack and use cases.

The platform architecture emphasizes modularity while maintaining tight integration between products, enabling organizations to adopt individual components or the complete suite based on their analytics and experimentation maturity.
