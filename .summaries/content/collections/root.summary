Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools for understanding user behavior, optimizing product experiences, and driving growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Core Product Architecture and Relationships

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational product, providing event tracking, user segmentation, and behavioral analysis through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, Revenue LTV, and Experiment Results. The analytics platform supports both current and legacy chart implementations.

**Amplitude Experiment** enables feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities, integrating deeply with the analytics platform for experiment analysis. It includes advanced techniques, experiment theory, workflow management, and comprehensive troubleshooting resources. The product operates through both client-side and server-side SDKs with dedicated APIs for experiment management.

**Amplitude Session Replay** provides user session recording and analysis capabilities, allowing teams to observe actual user interactions and identify friction points in the user experience.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** delivers in-product user engagement through contextual guidance, onboarding flows, and feedback collection mechanisms, serving as an alternative to traditional popup systems.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation through source and destination catalogs, audience management, and warehouse-native capabilities. It includes PII integrations and comprehensive data governance features.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Analytics Concepts:**
- **Events** - User actions tracked within applications (page views, clicks, purchases)
- **Properties** - Attributes associated with events and users for segmentation and analysis
- **Cohorts** - User segments based on behavioral or demographic criteria
- **Funnels** - Sequential user journey analysis showing conversion rates between steps
- **Retention** - Measurement of user return behavior over time periods
- **Amplitude IDs** - Unique identifiers including deviceId, userId, and sessionId for user tracking

**Experimentation Terminology:**
- **Feature Flags** - Boolean toggles controlling feature availability
- **Variants** - Different versions of features being tested in experiments
- **Allocation** - Percentage of users exposed to experiment variants
- **Statistical Significance** - Confidence level in experiment results
- **Lift** - Percentage improvement in key metrics from experiments

**Data Management:**
- **Sources** - Data ingestion points from various platforms and applications
- **Destinations** - External systems receiving processed data from Amplitude
- **Transformations** - Data processing rules applied during ingestion
- **Taxonomy** - Standardized event and property naming conventions
- **Tracking Plans** - Structured specifications for event implementation

## SDK and API Ecosystem

The platform provides extensive SDK support across multiple programming languages and platforms:

**Analytics SDKs:** Browser (JavaScript/TypeScript), iOS (Swift), Android (Kotlin/Java), React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine. Each SDK supports core functionality including event tracking, user identification, and revenue logging.

**Experiment SDKs:** Dedicated SDKs for feature flagging and experimentation across web, mobile, and server-side environments with real-time flag evaluation and user targeting capabilities.

**Ampli Code Generation:** Type-safe wrapper generation from tracking plans, available for multiple languages to ensure implementation consistency and reduce tracking errors.

**API Endpoints:**
- Analytics API (`/analytics/`) - Event ingestion and data retrieval
- Experiment APIs (`/apis/experiment/`) - Flag management and evaluation
- Guides and Surveys API (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) - In-product experience management
- Various chart-specific APIs for data visualization and analysis

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** includes user provisioning, role-based access control, and organization settings. **Single Sign-On (SSO)** integration supports enterprise authentication systems with SAML and OAuth protocols.

**Billing and Usage** management provides consumption monitoring, plan management, and cost optimization tools across all Amplitude products.

**Migration Tools** facilitate transitions from other analytics platforms and legacy Amplitude implementations, including data import utilities and SDK upgrade guides.

## Developer Resources and Support

**Academy Content** provides educational materials, best practices, and implementation guides for all Amplitude products. **FAQ and Troubleshooting** sections offer comprehensive support documentation with platform-specific guidance.

**Partners Integration** includes pre-built connectors and integrations with popular marketing, analytics, and business intelligence tools, extending Amplitude's capabilities within existing technology stacks.

**Multi-language Support** includes Japanese localization for international deployments, with comprehensive documentation translation and region-specific compliance features.

The platform operates as a unified ecosystem where analytics data informs experimentation decisions, session replay provides qualitative context to quantitative insights, and guides/surveys enable direct user engagement based on behavioral patterns identified through the analytics platform. This integrated approach allows organizations to close the loop between user understanding and product optimization.
