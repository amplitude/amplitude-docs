Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products that work together to deliver end-to-end analytics, experimentation, and user engagement capabilities.

## Core Product Architecture

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, providing event tracking, user behavior analysis, and business intelligence through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Revenue LTV, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Data Tables, Compass, and Experiment Results. Each chart type offers specialized visualization and analysis capabilities for different aspects of user behavior and business metrics.

**Amplitude Experiment** is the feature flagging and A/B testing platform that enables controlled rollouts, multivariate testing, and advanced experimentation techniques. It includes experiment theory, workflow management, advanced techniques, troubleshooting capabilities, and "under the hood" technical implementation details.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user sessions to provide visual insights into user interactions and identify friction points in the user experience.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** delivers in-product user engagement through contextual guidance and feedback collection mechanisms.

## Multi-Platform SDK Ecosystem

The platform supports comprehensive instrumentation through dedicated SDKs across multiple platforms:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser SDK, Android SDK, iOS SDK, React Native SDK, Flutter SDK, Node.js SDK, Python SDK, Java SDK, Go SDK, Unity SDK, and Unreal SDK. Each SDK provides platform-specific implementation with routes following the pattern `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/{slug}`.

**Experiment SDKs** offer feature flagging and experimentation capabilities across platforms with dedicated documentation at `/sdks/experiment-sdks/{slug}`.

**Ampli** provides a code-generation tool that creates type-safe analytics implementations, ensuring data quality and consistency across development teams with documentation at `/sdks/ampli/{slug}`.

## Data Management and Customer Data Platform (CDP)

The **CDP** functionality includes comprehensive data management through Sources (data ingestion), Destinations (data activation), and Audiences (user segmentation). The Source Catalog and Destination Catalog provide extensive integration options with third-party platforms, categorized by integration types and supporting various data flow patterns.

**Warehouse-native Amplitude** enables organizations to run Amplitude analytics directly on their existing data warehouse infrastructure, providing flexibility and data sovereignty.

**PII Integrations** handle personally identifiable information with appropriate privacy and compliance controls.

## API Infrastructure

The platform provides extensive API access through:
- **Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/{slug}`) for programmatic access to analytics data
- **Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/{slug}`) for feature flag and experiment management
- **Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/{slug}`) for in-product experience management

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** provides organizational controls, user management, and access permissions through `/admin/account-management/{slug}`.

**Single Sign-on** enables enterprise authentication integration via `/admin/single-sign-on/{slug}`.

**Billing and Use** offers usage monitoring and billing management at `/admin/billing-use/{slug}`.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** are discrete user actions tracked within applications, forming the foundation of all analytics.

**Properties** are attributes associated with events or users that enable segmentation and analysis.

**Cohorts** are user segments defined by shared characteristics or behaviors.

**Funnels** represent sequential user journeys through defined conversion paths.

**Retention** measures user return behavior over specified time periods.

**Experiments** are controlled tests comparing different user experiences or feature variations.

**Feature Flags** enable dynamic feature control without code deployments.

**Segments** are filtered user groups based on properties or behaviors.

## Content Organization and Localization

The platform supports **multi-site architecture** with English (`en`) and Japanese (`jp`) localization. Japanese translation content is specifically managed through dedicated collections with specialized routing and navigation injection.

**Academy Content** provides educational resources and best practices for platform usage.

**FAQ and Troubleshooting** offers comprehensive support documentation for common issues and questions.

**Migration** documentation assists users transitioning from other analytics platforms.

**Partners** section details integration partnerships and third-party collaborations.

## Advanced Analytics Capabilities

**Legacy Charts** maintain backward compatibility with previous visualization formats while newer chart types provide enhanced functionality.

**Other Charts** encompass specialized visualization types for specific use cases.

The platform implements sophisticated **date behavior** controls with public/private visibility for past and future content, enabling staged content releases and time-sensitive documentation.

## Navigation and Information Architecture

Content is organized through hierarchical navigation with injected navigation titles including `analytics`, `experiment`, `data`, `apis`, `admin`, `get_started`, `developers`, `session_replay`, `web_experiment`, and specialized categories for different product areas.

**Preview targets** enable content preview functionality with automatic refresh capabilities, supporting content management workflows and quality assurance processes.

The platform uses **mount points** (UUID-based identifiers) to link related content collections, enabling complex content relationships and cross-referencing capabilities throughout the documentation ecosystem.
