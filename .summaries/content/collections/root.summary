Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize digital experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform provides event-based analytics, A/B testing capabilities, session recording, user surveys, and customer data platform functionality across web, mobile, and server-side implementations.

## Product Architecture and Core Components

Amplitude's ecosystem consists of several interconnected products that work together to provide end-to-end user analytics:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the core product analytics platform, offering 16 chart types organized around the customer lifecycle: Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Revenue LTV, Personas, Compass, and others. The platform processes events through a sophisticated segmentation engine that supports wildcard matching, behavioral cohorts, and complex user property filtering.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced statistical analysis, supporting both client-side and server-side experimentation. The product includes experiment theory guidance, advanced techniques for statistical power analysis, and comprehensive SDKs for implementation across platforms.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and reconstructs user interactions through DOM capture for web applications and view tree recording for mobile platforms. The product includes behavioral heatmaps, privacy masking controls, and integration with third-party analytics providers.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user engagement through targeted surveys, NPS collection, and user feedback mechanisms with API-driven customization capabilities.

**Amplitude Data (CDP)** functions as a customer data platform providing data governance, source/destination integrations, audience management, and warehouse-native analytics capabilities.

## Data Collection and SDK Ecosystem

The platform supports comprehensive data collection through multiple SDK implementations:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser SDK 2.0 (`@amplitude/analytics-browser`), iOS Swift SDK, Android Kotlin SDK, React Native SDK, Flutter SDK, Unity SDK, Unreal SDK, Node.js SDK, Python SDK, Java SDK, and Go SDK. Each SDK provides event tracking, user identification, session management, and platform-specific optimizations.

**Experiment SDKs** offer feature flag evaluation and A/B testing capabilities across JavaScript, React, Node.js, iOS, Android, Flutter, Unity, Python, Java, Go, PHP, and Ruby implementations.

**Ampli** generates strongly-typed tracking APIs from Amplitude Data tracking plans, providing compile-time validation and IDE autocomplete for event tracking across TypeScript, JavaScript, iOS, Android, Flutter, Unity, Python, Java, Go, and Kotlin implementations.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**User Identity System:**
- **Amplitude ID**: Platform-generated unique identifier
- **Device ID**: Platform-specific device identifier (IDFV for iOS, Android ID for Android)
- **User ID**: Custom application-assigned identifier for cross-device tracking
- **Session ID**: Time-based session identifier with configurable timeout (5 minutes mobile, 30 minutes web)

**Event Tracking:**
- **Events**: User actions tracked with verb+noun naming conventions, limited to 20 properties maximum
- **Event Properties**: Contextual data associated with specific events
- **User Properties**: Persistent characteristics associated with users
- **Group Properties**: Organization or account-level attributes
- **Inactive Events**: Events that don't count toward Monthly Tracked Users (MTU)

**Analytics Concepts:**
- **Active Users**: Users triggering any event within specified timeframe
- **Monthly Tracked Users (MTU)**: Billing metric for unique users per month
- **Behavioral Cohorts**: User segments based on shared behaviors
- **Retention**: Percentage of users returning after initial engagement
- **Stickiness**: Ratio of daily active users to monthly active users
- **Lifecycle**: User categorization (New, Current, Resurrected, Dormant)

**Experimentation Terms:**
- **Feature Flags**: Boolean toggles for feature control
- **Variants**: Different versions in A/B tests
- **Allocation**: Percentage of users exposed to experiments
- **Statistical Significance**: Confidence level for experiment results
- **Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE)**: Smallest change worth detecting

## Integration Ecosystem and Data Sources

Amplitude integrates with over 70 data sources through its Source Catalog, including marketing automation platforms, attribution providers, customer engagement tools, data warehouses, and survey platforms. Integration patterns include:

**Raw Events Integration** for direct behavioral event streaming, **Attribution API Integration** for marketing attribution data with 72-hour attribution windows, **Cohorts Integration** for bidirectional audience sharing, **Event-Streaming Integration** for real-time data synchronization, and **Warehouse Integration** supporting Snowflake, BigQuery, and Databricks with Change Data Capture (CDC) capabilities.

The Destination Catalog enables data activation through 50+ destinations including marketing platforms (Braze, Iterable, Klaviyo), advertising platforms (Facebook Ads, Google Ads), and data warehouses for reverse ETL workflows.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Core APIs:**
- **HTTP API v2** (`/2/httpapi`): Primary event ingestion endpoint with batch processing
- **Identify API**: User property management and updates
- **Attribution API** (`/attribution`): Marketing attribution data ingestion
- **Dashboard REST API**: Programmatic dashboard and chart management
- **Export API**: Data extraction in JSON format
- **Behavioral Cohorts API**: Audience segment management
- **User Privacy API**: GDPR compliance and data deletion
- **DSAR API**: Data subject access request processing

**Authentication Methods:**
- API keys and secret keys for project-level access
- OAuth flows for third-party integrations
- SCIM 2.0 for user provisioning
- Service account authentication for warehouse connections

**SDK Initialization Examples:**
- Browser: `amplitude.init('API_KEY', 'USER_ID', options)`
- iOS: `Amplitude.instance().initializeApiKey("API_KEY")`
- Android: `Amplitude.getInstance().initialize(context, "API_KEY")`
- Node.js: `amplitude.init('API_KEY')`

## Administrative and Governance Features

**Account Management** provides hierarchical organization structure with Organizations containing multiple Projects. The system supports four user roles (Viewer, Member, Manager, Admin) with Permission Groups for Enterprise customers enabling scalable user administration across projects.

**Privacy and Compliance** features include GDPR/CNIL compliance tools, consent management platform integration, data deletion capabilities, PII filtering, and cookie management with AMP_ prefixed cookies.

**Data Governance** includes Dynamic Behavioral Sampling for cost management, data quality monitoring, schema enforcement through Amplitude Data, and warehouse-native analytics for enterprise-scale data processing.

The platform emphasizes data taxonomy planning through tracking plan templates, event naming conventions, and pre-instrumentation workflow organization to ensure clean, actionable analytics implementation across teams and use cases.
