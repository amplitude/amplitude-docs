## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Analytics Terms
- **Event** - A user action or system occurrence tracked in Amplitude
- **Property** - Metadata associated with events
- **User Property** - Attributes associated with users
- **Cohort** - A group of users who share common characteristics
- **Funnel** - A sequence of events representing a user journey
- **Retention** - Measurement of user return behavior over time
- **Session** - A period of continuous user activity

### Experimentation Terms
- **Experiment** - A controlled test comparing different variations
- **Variant** - A specific version being tested in an experiment
- **Flag** - A feature toggle used to control experiment exposure
- **Targeting** - Rules determining which users see which variants
- **Evaluation** - The process of determining which variant to show a user

### Data Management Terms
- **Source** - An origin point for data ingestion
- **Destination** - An endpoint for data export
- **Integration** - A connection between Amplitude and another system
- **Taxonomy** - The organizational structure of events and properties
- **Tracking Plan** - A specification for what events to track and how

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's products are designed to work together in an integrated ecosystem:

1. **Analytics + Experiment** - Experiment results are analyzed using Analytics charts
2. **Analytics + Guides and Surveys** - Guide and survey interactions generate analytics events
3. **Data Management + Analytics** - Data collected through SDKs and integrations feeds into analytics
4. **Session Replay + Analytics** - Session recordings are linked to user profiles and events
5. **Experiment + Guides and Surveys** - Guides can be A/B tested using Experiment

The platform also integrates with external systems through:
- **Data Warehouse Integrations** - Direct connections to data warehouses
- **API Access** - Programmatic interfaces for data access and management
- **SDK Ecosystem** - Client libraries for various platforms and languages

## API and SDK References

### Analytics API
- Base URL: `/apis/analytics/`
- Key endpoints for querying analytics data, managing cohorts, and accessing user profiles

### Experiment API
- Base URL: `/apis/experiment/`
- Endpoints for managing experiments, flags, and retrieving results

### Guides and Surveys API
- Base URL: `/apis/guides-and-surveys/`
- Endpoints for creating and managing in-product messages and surveys

### SDK Implementation
Amplitude provides SDKs for multiple platforms with consistent methods:
```javascript
// Browser SDK example
amplitude.init('API_KEY');
amplitude.track('Event Name', {property: 'value'});
```

```swift
// iOS SDK example
Amplitude.instance().initializeApiKey("API_KEY")
Amplitude.instance().logEvent("Event Name", withEventProperties: ["property": "value"])
```

The Ampli SDK provides code generation for type-safe analytics implementation across platforms, ensuring consistent event tracking across client applications.
