Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics platform that provides organizations with advanced capabilities for tracking, analyzing, and understanding user behavior across web and mobile applications. The platform operates on an event-based data model and offers multiple specialized products for analytics, experimentation, customer data management, and user engagement.

## Core Product Architecture and Features

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, providing sophisticated event-based tracking with support for both individual user-level and account-level reporting through the Accounts add-on. The platform offers multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Pathfinder, Journeys, Stickiness, Lifecycle, Compass, Data Tables, Personas, Revenue LTV, Impact Analysis, and Engagement Matrix. Advanced analytical features include cohort analysis, anomaly detection using Prophet-based algorithms, Historical Count tracking, and Microscope for detailed data point inspection.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced statistical analysis. The platform supports complex experiment design through advanced techniques, comprehensive experiment theory documentation, and detailed result analysis. It includes workflow management for experiment lifecycle and troubleshooting tools for implementation issues.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and routing through source and destination catalogs. The platform supports warehouse-native architecture, audience creation and management, and PII (Personally Identifiable Information) handling with specialized integrations.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user session recordings for web applications, providing qualitative context to quantitative analytics data with 90-day retention and integration across chart types.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-app user engagement through guided experiences and feedback collection, with dedicated API endpoints for programmatic control.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

The Amplitude ecosystem operates through tightly integrated components where Analytics serves as the central data foundation. Session Replay enhances Analytics by providing qualitative context to quantitative insights through Microscope integration. Experiment leverages Analytics data for statistical analysis and result measurement, while the CDP ensures clean data flow between all products. Guides and Surveys utilize Analytics tracking for engagement measurement and user segmentation.

AI capabilities are embedded throughout the platform via Ask Amplitude (using Amazon Bedrock LLM API) for natural language chart creation and the Amplitude Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server providing 17 specialized tools for conversational analytics. Spaces organize analytical assets into collaborative workspaces with permission controls and Slack integration for team coordination.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Collections Structure**: The platform organizes content through collections representing different product areas, SDK documentation, chart types, and administrative functions. Each collection has specific routing patterns (e.g., `/analytics/{slug}`, `/feature-experiment/{slug}`, `/data/{slug}`).

**Group Types and Values**: In account-level reporting, group types represent categories of accounts while group values are specific instances, supporting up to five group types per project with 1000 account-level properties.

**Behavioral Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments based on actions and traits within specific time periods, supporting complex conditions including event counting methods, temporal parameters, and logical operators.

**Mount Points**: Technical identifiers (UUIDs) that link collections to specific content trees, enabling hierarchical organization of documentation and features.

**Navigation Injection**: System for organizing content under specific navigation categories (analytics, experiment, data, apis, etc.) with blade-specific branding for different product lines.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

**Multi-Language Support**: The platform provides comprehensive SDK support across programming languages including JavaScript (Browser), Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine. Framework integrations extend support to popular development environments.

**API Infrastructure**: Extensive API coverage includes Analytics API, Experiment APIs, and Guides and Surveys API, with dedicated endpoints for different product functions and data management operations.

**Third-Party Integrations**: Comprehensive integration ecosystem through source and destination catalogs, supporting data ingestion from various platforms and routing to downstream systems. Partner integrations extend platform capabilities through certified third-party solutions.

**Enterprise Administration**: Robust administrative capabilities including account management, billing and usage monitoring, single sign-on (SSO) integration, and user permission management across organizational structures.

## Technical Implementation and Routing

**URL Structure**: Systematic routing patterns organize content hierarchically:
- Analytics: `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/{slug}`
- Experiment: `/feature-experiment/{category}/{slug}`
- SDKs: `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/{slug}`
- APIs: `/apis/{product}/{slug}`
- Data Management: `/data/{category}/{slug}`

**Content Management**: Collections support various configurations including site-specific content (English/Japanese), propagation settings, revision control, and preview capabilities. Date behavior controls content visibility with past/future publication states.

**Internationalization**: Japanese translation support through dedicated collections with localized routing and navigation injection, enabling global platform adoption.

The platform serves organizations from startup to enterprise scale with tiered feature availability, supporting complex analytical workflows from basic event tracking to sophisticated behavioral analysis, experimentation, and automated insights generation. The modular architecture allows organizations to adopt individual products or implement the complete Amplitude suite for comprehensive digital analytics capabilities.
