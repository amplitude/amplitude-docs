Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools for understanding user behavior, running controlled experiments, and managing feature rollouts. The platform consists of several interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Core Product Architecture

The platform operates through multiple interconnected modules:

**Analytics Core** serves as the foundation, providing event tracking, user behavior analysis, and comprehensive charting capabilities. The analytics engine supports various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Revenue LTV, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Data Tables, and Compass for advanced analytics.

**Amplitude Experiment** functions as the feature flagging and A/B testing platform, supporting both local and remote evaluation modes with sophisticated traffic allocation, mutual exclusion groups, and statistical analysis capabilities including Bonferroni correction for multiple hypothesis testing.

**Session Replay** captures and analyzes user interactions for qualitative insights, while **Guides and Surveys** enables in-product messaging and user feedback collection.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation through source and destination catalogs, audience management, and warehouse-native capabilities.

## Product Relationships and Integration

The products integrate through shared user identification systems, event tracking infrastructure, and cross-platform data sharing. Analytics provides the behavioral data foundation that powers Experiment's targeting capabilities, while Session Replay offers qualitative context for quantitative analytics insights. The CDP serves as the data backbone, managing data flow between internal products and external integrations.

Experiment results feed back into Analytics for comprehensive impact analysis, and both products leverage shared cohort definitions and user segmentation. Guides and Surveys can be triggered based on Analytics insights and Experiment variant assignments, creating a unified user experience optimization workflow.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Sticky Bucketing**: Ensures consistent variant assignments across user sessions in experiments
**Mutual Exclusion Groups**: Prevents users from participating in conflicting experiments simultaneously  
**Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM)**: Statistical test detecting unexpected traffic allocation imbalances
**Cumulative Exposure Analysis**: Method for analyzing experiment health through user assignment patterns
**Winsorization**: Statistical technique for handling outliers by capping extreme values
**Flag Prerequisites**: Dependency system allowing experiments conditional on other flag states
**Holdout Groups**: Control populations for measuring cumulative program impact
**Ampli**: Type-safe analytics wrapper providing compile-time validation for event tracking
**Mount Points**: Content management system identifiers linking collections to specific content trees

## SDK and API Architecture

The platform provides extensive SDK coverage across platforms:

**Analytics SDKs**: Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal implementations for comprehensive event tracking

**Experiment SDKs**: Specialized SDKs for feature flagging with both server-side and client-side evaluation capabilities

**Ampli**: Code generation tool creating type-safe analytics implementations with compile-time validation

**API Endpoints**: RESTful APIs for Analytics (`/apis/analytics/`), Experiment (`/apis/experiment/`), and Guides and Surveys (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) enabling programmatic access and custom integrations

## Broader Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude operates as a central hub in the modern data stack through extensive integration capabilities:

**Source Catalog**: Ingests data from various platforms and services through pre-built connectors
**Destination Catalog**: Activates insights by sending data to downstream tools and platforms  
**Partners Program**: Extends functionality through third-party integrations and specialized use cases
**Warehouse-Native**: Enables analysis of data stored in customer data warehouses without data movement

The platform supports enterprise requirements through comprehensive admin capabilities including account management, billing and usage monitoring, single sign-on integration, and PII handling compliance features.

## Content and Documentation Structure

The documentation architecture reflects the product complexity with specialized sections for getting started, instrumentation guidance, detailed product documentation, API references, troubleshooting resources, and migration assistance. The system supports multi-language content with dedicated Japanese translations and includes an academy content system for educational resources.

The platform's routing structure (`/analytics/`, `/feature-experiment/`, `/data/`, `/sdks/`, `/apis/`) mirrors the product architecture, providing intuitive navigation through the comprehensive feature set while maintaining clear separation between different product areas and use cases.
