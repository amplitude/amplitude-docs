## Amplitude Analytics and Experimentation Platform

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools for user behavior analysis, A/B testing, feature flagging, customer data management, and user engagement optimization. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products designed to support the complete product development and optimization lifecycle.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

### Core Product Suite
The platform is organized around four primary product areas:

**Analytics Core** serves as the foundational data collection and analysis engine, encompassing event tracking, user behavior analysis, and comprehensive charting capabilities. This includes specialized chart types like Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, Cohort Analysis (Lifecycle), User Journey mapping (Journeys), Revenue LTV analysis, and behavioral metrics (Stickiness, Engagement Matrix).

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities, integrating closely with the analytics core to measure experiment impact. It includes advanced statistical analysis, experiment theory implementation, and comprehensive result tracking through dedicated Experiment Results charts.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and distribution through Sources and Destinations catalogs, Audiences creation, and warehouse-native integrations. It supports both real-time and batch data processing workflows.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user sessions for qualitative insights, while **Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user engagement and feedback collection.

### SDK and Integration Architecture
The platform supports multiple SDK implementations across programming languages and platforms:

- **Analytics SDKs**: Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine
- **Experiment SDKs**: Dedicated SDKs for feature flagging and experimentation
- **Ampli**: Type-safe wrapper providing strongly-typed event tracking generated from tracking plans
- **Agents**: Automated data collection and processing components

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Analytics Concepts
- **Events**: User actions tracked through the platform, forming the basis of all analysis
- **Properties**: Attributes associated with events (event properties) or users (user properties)
- **Segments**: Filtered subsets of users or events used for targeted analysis
- **Cohorts**: Groups of users defined by shared characteristics or behaviors
- **Funnels**: Sequential user journey analysis showing conversion rates between steps
- **Retention**: Measurement of user return behavior over specified time periods

### Experimentation Terminology
- **Feature Flags**: Boolean toggles controlling feature availability
- **Variants**: Different versions of features or experiences in experiments
- **Allocation**: Distribution of users across experiment variants
- **Statistical Significance**: Confidence level in experiment results
- **Lift**: Percentage improvement of treatment over control

### Data Management
- **Sources**: Data input connectors from various platforms and applications
- **Destinations**: Output connectors sending processed data to external systems
- **Transformations**: Data processing rules applied during ingestion
- **Audiences**: Dynamically updated user segments based on behavioral criteria
- **Warehouse-native**: Direct integration with cloud data warehouses

### Technical Infrastructure
- **Instrumentation**: Implementation of tracking code across applications
- **Autocapture**: Automated event collection without manual instrumentation
- **Real-time**: Immediate data processing and availability
- **Batch Processing**: Scheduled bulk data processing operations

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

### Multi-Platform Data Collection
The platform operates as a unified analytics layer across web, mobile, server-side, and IoT environments. SDKs provide consistent APIs while adapting to platform-specific requirements and constraints.

### Enterprise Integration Capabilities
Amplitude integrates with enterprise data infrastructure through:
- **Warehouse Integrations**: Direct connections to Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, and other cloud data warehouses
- **Marketing Technology Stack**: Integrations with advertising platforms, email marketing tools, and customer engagement platforms
- **Product Development Tools**: Connections to feature management platforms, CI/CD pipelines, and development workflows

### Privacy and Compliance Framework
The platform includes comprehensive privacy controls supporting GDPR, CCPA, and other regulatory requirements through data residency options, user consent management, and PII handling capabilities.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

### Analytics APIs
- **HTTP v2 API**: Primary event ingestion endpoint (`/2/httpapi`) for real-time data collection
- **Batch API**: Bulk event upload for historical data import
- **Export API**: Data extraction for external analysis and backup
- **Cohort API**: Programmatic audience management and synchronization

### Experiment APIs
- **Flag Evaluation API**: Real-time feature flag and variant assignment
- **Assignment API**: Experiment enrollment and tracking
- **Results API**: Programmatic access to experiment statistics and outcomes

### Management APIs
- **Taxonomy API**: Event and property schema management
- **User API**: Individual user data management and deletion
- **Project API**: Organizational and access control management

### CLI and Development Tools
- **Ampli CLI**: Code generation and validation tool with commands like `ampli pull`, `ampli push`, and `ampli status`
- **Data Validation**: Real-time event validation and debugging capabilities
- **Migration Tools**: Utilities for transitioning between SDK versions and platforms
