## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: A user action or system occurrence tracked in Amplitude
- **User Property**: Attributes associated with users (demographics, preferences, etc.)
- **Cohort**: A group of users who share common characteristics or behaviors
- **Session**: A period of continuous user activity
- **Funnel**: A sequence of events representing a conversion path
- **Retention**: Measurement of how users continue to engage over time
- **Experiment**: A controlled test to measure the impact of changes
- **Variant**: A specific version in an experiment
- **SDK (Software Development Kit)**: Libraries for implementing Amplitude in applications
- **API (Application Programming Interface)**: Programmatic interfaces for interacting with Amplitude

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's products are designed to work together in a cohesive workflow:

1. **Data Collection**: Events and user properties are captured via SDKs or data integrations
2. **Analysis**: Data is visualized and analyzed through various chart types
3. **Segmentation**: Users are grouped into meaningful cohorts based on behavior
4. **Experimentation**: Hypotheses are tested through controlled experiments
5. **Activation**: Insights are deployed through integrations with marketing and product tools

The platform supports a "data-insight-action" loop where analytics inform experiments, which generate insights that drive personalization and product improvements.

## API Endpoints and SDK Implementation

### Analytics API
```
POST https://api.amplitude.com/2/httpapi
```
Used for sending events to Amplitude programmatically.

### Experiment API
```
GET https://api.lab.amplitude.com/v1/vardata
```
Used for retrieving experiment variant assignments.

### SDK Implementation Examples

**Browser SDK:**
```javascript
amplitude.getInstance().logEvent("Button Clicked", {
  buttonColor: "blue",
  buttonText: "Sign Up"
});
```

**iOS SDK:**
```swift
Amplitude.instance().logEvent("Button Clicked", withEventProperties: [
  "buttonColor": "blue",
  "buttonText": "Sign Up"
])
```

**Android SDK:**
```java
Amplitude.getInstance().logEvent("Button Clicked", new JSONObject().put("buttonColor", "blue").put("buttonText", "Sign Up"));
```

The documentation is organized to support different user personas including developers implementing tracking, analysts exploring data, and administrators managing the platform. The content structure reflects both product-based organization (Analytics, Experiment, etc.) and role-based needs (implementation, analysis, administration).
