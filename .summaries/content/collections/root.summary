Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven decision making. The platform consists of four primary product suites: Analytics (behavioral analysis), Experiment (feature flagging and A/B testing), Session Replay (user session recording), and Customer Data Platform (CDP) for data management and activation.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The platform operates on a hub-and-spoke architecture where the Analytics core serves as the central data processing engine, with specialized modules extending functionality. The Analytics suite provides foundational event tracking and user behavior analysis through multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, Cohort Analysis, and User Journey mapping. These charts share common segmentation capabilities and can be cross-referenced through saved cohorts and user lookup functionality.

Amplitude Experiment integrates directly with the Analytics engine to provide statistical analysis of feature flag performance through dedicated Experiment Results charts. The platform supports both client-side and server-side experimentation with advanced targeting capabilities through audience segmentation. Session Replay operates as a complementary observational tool, providing qualitative context to quantitative analytics insights.

The CDP functionality encompasses data ingestion through Sources, data activation through Destinations, and audience management through real-time segmentation. The platform supports both warehouse-native architectures and traditional event streaming patterns, with over 100+ pre-built integrations in the source and destination catalogs.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** represent discrete user actions tracked with associated properties and timestamps. **User Properties** are attributes assigned to individual users, while **Group Properties** enable account-level or organizational analysis. **Cohorts** are dynamic user segments based on behavioral criteria or property values.

**Experiments** consist of feature flags with multiple variants, targeting rules, and statistical analysis configurations. **Flags** control feature visibility and can operate in boolean, string, number, or JSON modes. **Deployments** represent different environments (development, staging, production) with independent flag configurations.

**Charts** are analytical visualizations with specific methodologies: Event Segmentation measures event volumes and property distributions, Funnels track conversion through sequential steps, Retention measures user return behavior, and Journeys map user pathways between events. **Dashboards** combine multiple charts with shared date ranges and filters.

**Sources** are data ingestion points (SDKs, APIs, third-party integrations), while **Destinations** are activation endpoints for sending processed data to external systems. **Transformations** enable real-time data manipulation during ingestion.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates with the broader product development and marketing technology stack through multiple vectors. The platform connects with development workflows through GitHub, Jira, and deployment pipeline integrations for release tracking and feature correlation analysis. Marketing teams leverage destination integrations with advertising platforms (Facebook, Google Ads), email systems (Braze, Iterable), and customer success tools (Salesforce, Zendesk).

The platform supports enterprise governance through SCIM 2.0 user provisioning, SSO integration with major identity providers, and role-based access controls. Data governance features include PII detection, data classification, and automated compliance workflows for GDPR and CCPA requirements.

For technical teams, Amplitude provides extensive SDK coverage across web (Browser SDK), mobile (iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter), server-side (Node.js, Python, Java, Go), and gaming platforms (Unity, Unreal). The Ampli wrapper provides type-safe event tracking with code generation capabilities.
