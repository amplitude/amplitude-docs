## Amplitude Documentation Platform Overview

Amplitude operates a comprehensive multi-product analytics and experimentation platform with extensive documentation organized across distinct product verticals. The platform encompasses behavioral analytics, feature experimentation, customer data management, session replay capabilities, and user engagement tools, all supported by robust SDK libraries and API integrations.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The documentation reveals a hierarchical product structure centered around **Amplitude Analytics** as the core behavioral analytics engine, with specialized modules extending functionality:

**Analytics Core** provides foundational event tracking and user behavior analysis through multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, Cohort Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Revenue LTV, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Personas, Data Tables, and Compass. Legacy chart types are maintained for backward compatibility.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with dedicated sections for workflow management, advanced techniques, experiment theory, troubleshooting, and "under the hood" technical implementation details.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and distribution through source catalogs, destination catalogs, audience management, and warehouse-native integrations. PII handling integrations ensure compliance with data privacy requirements.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user session recordings for qualitative behavioral insights.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user engagement through guided experiences and feedback collection.

**Web Experiment** provides browser-based experimentation capabilities as a specialized subset of the broader experiment platform.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Collections Structure**: Documentation is organized into collections representing product areas, each with specific routing patterns (e.g., `/analytics/{slug}`, `/feature-experiment/{slug}`, `/data/{slug}`).

**Mount Points**: UUID-based content mounting system (e.g., `mount: ba956cb4-9ae1-456a-b122-984b491048f6`) enabling modular content organization across product areas.

**Navigation Injection**: Systematic navigation categorization through `nav_title` properties including `analytics`, `experiment`, `data`, `apis`, `developers`, `admin`, `get_started`, and specialized chart categories.

**Blade System**: Product branding mechanism with specific blade identifiers like "Amplitude Experiment", "Amplitude Session Replay", and "Amplitude Guides and Surveys" for consistent product presentation.

**Site Propagation**: Multi-language support with English (`en`) and Japanese (`jp`) site variants, controlled through `sites` and `propagate` configuration parameters.

**Date Behavior**: Content visibility management with `past: public` and `future: private` settings controlling documentation release timing.

**Preview Targets**: Live preview functionality with `{permalink}` URL generation and refresh capabilities for content validation.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The documentation architecture reflects Amplitude's position as an integrated customer analytics platform:

**Developer Ecosystem**: Comprehensive SDK support across platforms including Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine. The **Ampli** code generation tool provides type-safe analytics implementation across these platforms.

**API Infrastructure**: Dedicated API documentation for Analytics, Experiment, and Guides and Surveys, enabling programmatic access to platform capabilities.

**Enterprise Administration**: Complete administrative functionality covering account management, billing and usage tracking, single sign-on integration, and user access controls.

**Partner Integrations**: Extensive third-party integration ecosystem through source and destination catalogs, enabling data flow between Amplitude and external marketing, analytics, and business intelligence tools.

**Migration Support**: Dedicated migration documentation facilitating platform transitions and implementation upgrades.
