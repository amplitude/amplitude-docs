Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of several interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Core Product Architecture

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, providing event tracking, user segmentation, and behavioral analysis through multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Revenue LTV, and Experiment Results. Each chart type offers specialized visualization and analysis capabilities for different aspects of user behavior.

**Amplitude Experiment** is the feature flagging and A/B testing platform that enables controlled feature rollouts and experimentation. It includes advanced techniques, experiment theory, workflow management, troubleshooting tools, and "under the hood" technical documentation. The platform integrates with analytics for comprehensive experiment analysis and results tracking.

**Amplitude Session Replay** provides session recording and playback capabilities for understanding user interactions and identifying friction points in the user experience.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** offers in-product user experience tools for onboarding, engagement, and feedback collection through interactive guides, surveys, and resource centers.

## SDK and Integration Ecosystem

The platform provides extensive SDK coverage across multiple programming languages and platforms:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine implementations, each following platform-specific conventions while maintaining consistent core functionality.

**Experiment SDKs** provide feature flag evaluation and experiment participation across the same platform coverage.

**Ampli** serves as a type-safe wrapper that generates strongly-typed tracking libraries from Amplitude's Data taxonomy, ensuring consistent event tracking across teams and platforms.

All SDKs follow consistent patterns for initialization, event tracking, user identification, and configuration management, with platform-specific optimizations for performance and integration.

## API Infrastructure

The platform exposes comprehensive REST APIs for programmatic access:

**Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/`) provides endpoints for event ingestion, user management, and data retrieval.

**Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) enable flag management, experiment configuration, and results analysis.

**Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) supports content management and interaction tracking.

All APIs follow RESTful conventions with authentication, rate limiting, and comprehensive error handling.

## Data Management and CDP

The **Customer Data Platform (CDP)** (`/data/`) provides unified data management capabilities including:

**Sources** for data ingestion from various platforms and services through the Source Catalog, which categorizes integrations by type and provides standardized connection methods.

**Destinations** for data activation through the Destination Catalog, enabling data export to marketing tools, warehouses, and other platforms.

**Audiences** for user segmentation and cohort management based on behavioral and demographic criteria.

**Warehouse-native Amplitude** for organizations preferring to keep data in their own infrastructure while leveraging Amplitude's analytics capabilities.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** are user actions tracked within applications, forming the foundation of all analytics.

**Properties** are attributes associated with events or users that provide context and enable segmentation.

**Cohorts** are user segments defined by shared characteristics or behaviors.

**Funnels** represent sequential user journeys through defined steps.

**Retention** measures user return behavior over specified time periods.

**Amplitude IDs** are unique identifiers for users across sessions and devices.

**Feature Flags** are toggles that control feature availability for different user segments.

**Variants** are different versions of features or experiences in experiments.

**Exposure Events** track when users encounter experiment variants.

**Conversion Events** measure desired outcomes in experiments and funnels.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** (`/admin/account-management/`) provides organization-level controls for user access, permissions, and settings.

**Single Sign-On** (`/admin/single-sign-on/`) enables enterprise authentication integration with SAML and OAuth providers.

**Billing and Use** (`/admin/billing-use/`) offers usage monitoring, plan management, and cost optimization tools.

**PII Integrations** (`/data/pii/`) provide privacy-compliant handling of personally identifiable information.

## Multi-language and Localization

The platform supports internationalization through:

**Japanese Translation** collection providing localized documentation and interface elements.

**Multi-site Architecture** supporting both English (`en`) and Japanese (`jp`) content with appropriate routing and navigation.

## Migration and Onboarding

**Get Started** documentation provides comprehensive onboarding flows for new users and organizations.

**Migration** guides assist organizations transitioning from other analytics platforms.

**Instrumentation** documentation covers implementation best practices and SDK integration patterns.

**FAQ and Troubleshooting** provides solutions to common implementation and usage challenges.

## Partner Ecosystem

The **Partners** collection documents third-party integrations, certified partners, and ecosystem extensions that enhance platform capabilities.

**Academy Content** provides educational resources, training materials, and certification programs for users at different skill levels.

The platform's architecture emphasizes modularity, allowing organizations to adopt individual components or the complete suite based on their needs, while maintaining data consistency and integration across all products through unified user identification and event tracking systems.
