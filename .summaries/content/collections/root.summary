## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event** - A user action or system occurrence tracked in Amplitude
- **User** - An individual interacting with a product, identified by user_id or device_id
- **Session** - A period of continuous user engagement
- **Funnel** - A sequence of events representing a user journey
- **Retention** - Measurement of user return behavior over time
- **Variant** - A specific version of a feature in an experiment
- **Feature Flag** - A toggle that controls feature visibility or behavior
- **Deployment Key** - Authentication credential for Experiment evaluation
- **Source/Destination** - Data integration endpoints for ingestion/export
- **Cohort** - A group of users sharing common characteristics

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude platform consists of several interconnected products that work together:

1. **Analytics** forms the core of the platform, providing insights into user behavior
2. **Experiment** leverages analytics data to test hypotheses and measure impact
3. **Data Management** tools ensure quality data collection and distribution
4. **SDKs** enable seamless integration across platforms and languages

The platform supports both client-side and server-side implementations, with appropriate deployment types and evaluation methods for each use case. Amplitude integrates with various data warehouses, allowing for warehouse-native implementations that sync data directly from storage systems like S3 or GCS.

## API Endpoints and Command Line Usage

### Analytics API
- Base endpoint: `/apis/analytics/`
- Provides access to event data, user properties, and analysis results

### Experiment APIs
- Evaluation API: `GET /api/2/flags/evaluate` - Retrieves variant assignments
- Flags API: `GET /api/2/flags` - Downloads flag configurations
- Management APIs for experiments, flags, deployments, holdouts, and mutex groups

### SDK Implementation Patterns
Most SDKs implement these core methods:
- **initialize** - Set up the client with configuration options
- **track/logEvent** - Record user actions
- **identify** - Associate user properties
- **setUserId/setDeviceId** - Manage user identity

### Experiment SDK Methods
- **fetch/fetchV2** - Retrieve flag variants for a user
- **evaluate/evaluateV2** - Evaluate flag variants locally
- **variant** - Get a specific flag variant for a user
- **exposure/track** - Record exposure events

The documentation provides comprehensive guidance on implementing these APIs across various platforms and languages, with specific code examples and configuration options for each supported environment.
