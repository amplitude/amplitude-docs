3. **Analysis Layer**: The processed data is made available through various analytics tools and charts for insights generation.

4. **Action Layer**: Insights drive actions through experimentation tools, allowing businesses to test hypotheses and optimize experiences.

5. **Integration Layer**: Data can be exported to other tools in the marketing and product tech stack through the Destination Catalog.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: A user action or system occurrence that is tracked (e.g., page view, button click)
- **User**: An individual interacting with a product, identified by a unique ID
- **Session**: A period of continuous user activity
- **Cohort**: A group of users who share common characteristics or behaviors
- **Funnel**: A series of steps users take toward a conversion goal
- **Retention**: Measurement of how many users return to a product over time
- **Experiment**: A controlled test comparing different versions of a feature or experience
- **Variant**: A specific version in an experiment
- **Flag Key**: Unique identifier for an experiment or feature flag
- **Impression**: An instance of a user being exposed to an experiment

## Technical Implementation

### SDK Implementation
Amplitude provides SDKs for various platforms. A typical browser implementation looks like:

```javascript
// Initialize Amplitude
amplitude.init('API_KEY');

// Track an event
amplitude.track('Button Clicked', {
  buttonColor: 'blue',
  buttonText: 'Sign Up'
});

// Identify a user
amplitude.identify(new amplitude.Identify()
  .set('plan', 'premium')
  .set('role', 'admin'));
```

### Experiment Implementation
For web experimentation:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.experiment.amplitude.com/experiment-js-sdk/0.5.0/experiment.umd.js"></script>
<script>
  amplitude.add(amplitude.Experiment);
  amplitude.experiment.init('API_KEY');
  amplitude.experiment.fetch().then(() => {
    const variant = amplitude.experiment.variant('my-experiment');
    if (variant === 'control') {
      // Show control experience
    } else if (variant === 'treatment') {
      // Show treatment experience
    }
  });
</script>
```

### API Endpoints
Amplitude provides REST APIs for various operations:

- **HTTP API**: `https://api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi` for sending events
- **Export API**: `https://amplitude.com/api/2/export` for exporting raw data
- **Dashboard API**: `https://amplitude.com/api/3/chart/{chart_id}` for accessing chart data
- **Experiment API**: `https://experiment.amplitude.com/api/1/flags` for managing experiments
