# Amplitude Product Ecosystem Overview

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics platform that helps organizations understand user behavior, optimize experiences, and drive business outcomes. The documentation reveals a multi-faceted ecosystem with several key components:

1. **Analytics Platform**: Core analytics capabilities for tracking, visualizing, and analyzing user behavior
2. **Experiment**: Feature experimentation and A/B testing platform
3. **CDP (Customer Data Platform)**: Data management and audience segmentation
4. **SDKs**: Client and server libraries for various platforms to collect and send data
5. **APIs**: Programmatic interfaces for data access and integration
6. **Data Management**: Tools for handling data sources, destinations, and PII

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Amplitude ecosystem is organized into several interconnected products:

### Analytics Core
- **Charts and Visualizations**: Various analytics views including Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Revenue/LTV, Impact Analysis, Event Segmentation, Personas, and Engagement Matrix
- **Compass**: Appears to be a feature for discovering insights
- **Session Replay**: Capability to record and replay user sessions

### Data Collection and Management
- **SDKs**: Client libraries for multiple platforms (Android, iOS, Web/Browser, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, Unreal)
- **Ampli**: Code-generated wrapper providing type-safety and tracking plan enforcement
- **Sources**: Data ingestion points
- **Destinations**: Data export endpoints
- **PII Integrations**: Tools for managing personally identifiable information

### Experimentation
- **Experiment**: A/B testing platform with dedicated SDKs and APIs
- **Web Experiment**: Web-specific experimentation tools
- **Experiment Results**: Analytics for experiment outcomes
- **Experiment Theory**: Educational content about experimentation methodology

### Administration
- **Account Management**: User and organization administration
- **Billing and Usage**: Subscription and consumption tracking
- **Single Sign-On**: Enterprise authentication integration

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: A discrete user action or occurrence tracked in the application
- **User Properties**: Attributes associated with a specific user
- **Cohort**: A group of users who share common characteristics
- **Funnel**: A series of steps users take toward a conversion goal
- **Retention**: Measurement of how many users return to the product over time
- **Session**: A period of continuous user engagement with an application
- **Tracking Plan**: A schema defining expected events and their properties
- **Integration**: Connection between Amplitude and external tools or platforms
- **Source**: Origin point for data coming into Amplitude
- **Destination**: Target system where Amplitude sends processed data
- **Experiment**: A controlled test comparing variants of a feature
- **Audience**: A defined segment of users for targeting or analysis

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The documentation suggests a highly integrated ecosystem where:

1. **Data Collection** occurs through SDKs and sources
2. **Data Processing** happens in the Amplitude platform
3. **Analysis** is performed using various chart types and visualization tools
4. **Experimentation** is conducted using the Experiment platform
5. **Data Activation** occurs through destinations and integrations
6. **User Management** is handled through account administration tools

The products are designed to work together, with data flowing between components. For example, experiment results can be analyzed in the analytics charts, and audiences defined in CDP can be used for targeting experiments.

## API Endpoints and Implementation Details

### SDK Implementation Patterns

Most SDKs follow a similar implementation pattern:

```javascript
// Initialization
const amplitude = new Amplitude('API_KEY');

// Event tracking
amplitude.track('Button Clicked', {buttonColor: 'blue'});

// User identification
amplitude.setUserId('user@example.com');
amplitude.identify(new Identify().set('plan', 'premium'));

// Group association
amplitude.setGroup('organization', 'org-123');
```

### Ampli Wrapper Implementation

```javascript
// Initialize Ampli
const ampli = Ampli.getInstance();
ampli.load({apiKey: 'API_KEY'});

// Track a typed event
ampli.songPlayed({
  songId: 'song-1',
  songName: 'Bohemian Rhapsody'
});
```

### API Endpoints

While specific endpoints aren't detailed in the provided files, the documentation suggests APIs for:

- Analytics data access
- User property management
- Experiment configuration and results
- Data export and import

## Collection Structure and Organization

The documentation is organized into collections that reflect the product structure:

1. **Product-specific collections**: analytics, experiment, CDP, etc.
2. **SDK-specific collections**: android_sdk, ios_sdk, browser_sdk, etc.
3. **Feature-specific collections**: charts, funnel-analysis, retention-analysis, etc.
4. **Administrative collections**: account-management, billing-use, etc.
5. **Educational collections**: get-started, migration, faq_and_troubleshooting, etc.

Each collection typically has a specific routing pattern (e.g., `/analytics/charts/{slug}` or `/sdks/analytics/android/{slug}`) and may inject navigation titles to place content within the appropriate section of the documentation.

The documentation appears to support both English and Japanese languages, with specific collections for Japanese translations.
