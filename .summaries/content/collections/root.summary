Amplitude Collections is a comprehensive data integration platform that serves as the central nervous system for connecting Amplitude's behavioral analytics ecosystem with external data sources and destinations. The platform enables bidirectional data flow through two primary components: the Source Catalog for data ingestion and the Destination Catalog for data export, creating a complete data pipeline solution for enterprise analytics workflows.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Collections platform operates through two complementary integration layers that work in tandem to create comprehensive data workflows:

**Source Catalog** functions as the data ingestion hub, importing customer data from external systems into Amplitude's analytics engine. Current integrations include HubSpot for CRM and marketing automation data, and Snowflake for enterprise data warehouse connectivity. The Source Catalog transforms external data into Amplitude's event processing pipeline, where it integrates with core analytics features including Session Replay, Autocapture, behavioral cohort analysis, and user journey tracking.

**Destination Catalog** serves as the data export orchestration system, transforming Amplitude's behavioral analytics data into warehouse-optimized formats for external analysis. The platform exports data through two primary pipelines: Raw Events Export for complete behavioral event streams and Merged User Identity Export for unified cross-device user profiles.

Both catalogs leverage Amplitude's core identity resolution and event processing capabilities, creating a unified data ecosystem that supports advanced analytics workflows, customer data platform construction, and machine learning initiatives.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Import Strategies** define four synchronization methodologies for data warehouse integration:
- **Full Sync**: Complete dataset refresh during each import cycle
- **Timestamp Sync**: Incremental imports based on timestamp field comparisons  
- **Append Only Sync**: Continuous addition of new records without modification
- **Mirror Sync**: Real-time synchronization using Change Data Capture (CDC) technology

**Destination Connector**: Integration module handling data export, transformation, and delivery to specific warehouse platforms

**Micro-batch Processing**: Data delivery methodology balancing real-time availability with warehouse performance through small, frequent event batches

**Product-Qualified Lead (PQL)**: Lead scoring methodology leveraging behavioral data to identify prospects based on actual product usage patterns

**Cohort Sync**: Process of exporting user segments from Amplitude to external platforms for targeted marketing campaigns

**Merged User IDs**: Identity resolution process consolidating multiple user identifiers across devices and sessions into unified profiles

**Amplitude ID**: Unique identifier assigned to user sessions and devices within Amplitude's tracking system

**VARIANT Data Types**: Snowflake-specific JSON-like data structure for storing flexible, semi-structured event properties

## Ecosystem Integration and Data Flow

Collections operates as the foundational data integration layer within Amplitude's broader product ecosystem, serving as both the primary data ingestion point and export orchestration system. The platform creates a comprehensive data pipeline that connects:

- **Upstream Systems**: CRM platforms (HubSpot), data warehouses (Snowflake), and marketing automation tools feed data into Amplitude's event processing pipeline
- **Core Analytics Engine**: Imported data flows through Amplitude's behavioral analytics capabilities, user segmentation engine, and visualization layer
- **Downstream Systems**: Processed insights and raw behavioral data export to business intelligence tools, machine learning platforms, and customer data platforms

The bidirectional nature enables product-led growth strategies by combining traditional CRM data with behavioral insights, supporting advanced lead scoring, marketing automation workflows, and comprehensive user journey analysis across the entire customer lifecycle.
