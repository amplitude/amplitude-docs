## Amplitude Analytics and Experimentation Platform

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools for understanding user behavior, conducting feature experiments, and optimizing product experiences. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products spanning analytics, experimentation, data management, and user engagement capabilities.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Amplitude ecosystem operates across several core product areas:

**Analytics Core:**
- **Analytics** - Primary behavioral analytics platform with multiple chart types (Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, Cohort Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Revenue LTV, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Personas, Data Tables, Compass)
- **Session Replay** - User session recording and playback capabilities for qualitative analysis
- **Charts** - Comprehensive visualization suite supporting both current and legacy chart implementations

**Experimentation Platform:**
- **Amplitude Experiment** - Feature flagging and A/B testing platform with advanced techniques, experiment theory, workflow management, and results analysis
- **Web Experiment** - Browser-based experimentation tools
- **Experiment Results** - Dedicated analytics for experiment performance measurement

**Data Infrastructure:**
- **CDP (Customer Data Platform)** - Centralized data management with source and destination catalogs
- **Audiences** - User segmentation and targeting capabilities
- **Data Tables** - Structured data analysis and reporting
- **Warehouse-native Amplitude** - Direct data warehouse integration
- **Sources and Destinations** - Extensive integration ecosystem with taxonomized categories

**Developer Tools:**
- **SDKs** - Comprehensive instrumentation libraries across platforms (iOS, Android, Browser, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, Unreal)
- **Ampli** - Type-safe analytics wrapper with code generation from tracking plans
- **APIs** - REST APIs for Analytics, Experiment, and Guides and Surveys

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Analytics Concepts:**
- **Events** - User actions tracked within applications (clicks, page views, purchases)
- **Properties** - Attributes associated with events and users for segmentation
- **Cohorts** - User groups defined by shared characteristics or behaviors
- **Funnels** - Sequential event analysis for conversion optimization
- **Retention** - User return behavior analysis over time periods
- **Segmentation** - Event volume and property analysis across user groups

**Experimentation Terms:**
- **Feature Flags** - Runtime configuration controls for feature rollouts
- **Variants** - Different versions of features tested in experiments
- **Allocation** - User assignment to experiment groups
- **Statistical Significance** - Confidence levels for experiment results
- **Lift** - Performance improvement measurements between variants

**Data Management:**
- **Tracking Plan** - Structured schema defining events and properties
- **Taxonomy** - Organized categorization of events and properties
- **Governance** - Data quality and compliance management
- **Instrumentation** - Code implementation for data collection
- **Transformations** - Data processing and enrichment rules

**Technical Infrastructure:**
- **Mount Points** - Content management system references for documentation organization
- **Collections** - Grouped content areas with shared routing and navigation
- **Injection** - Metadata insertion for navigation and branding
- **Propagation** - Multi-site content distribution settings

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The platform integrates across multiple dimensions:

**Multi-Product Workflows:**
- Experiment results automatically flow into Analytics charts for comprehensive analysis
- Audience segments created in Analytics can be used for Experiment targeting
- Session Replay provides qualitative context for quantitative Analytics insights
- CDP data feeds both Analytics and Experiment platforms

**Cross-Platform Consistency:**
- Unified SDK architecture across mobile, web, and server-side implementations
- Consistent API patterns for Analytics, Experiment, and Guides and Surveys
- Shared identity management and user property systems
- Common data governance and privacy controls

**Enterprise Integration:**
- Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication across all products
- Unified billing and usage management
- Account management with role-based access controls
- Partner ecosystem with pre-built integrations
