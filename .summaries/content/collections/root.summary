Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with behavioral analytics, user tracking, feature experimentation, and data management capabilities. The platform serves businesses from Growth to Enterprise tiers, offering sophisticated user behavior analysis, A/B testing, feature flags, and cross-project insights through a unified analytics ecosystem.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem operates on a hierarchical structure where **Organizations** contain multiple **Projects**, each representing distinct product analytics implementations. Projects serve as primary data containers housing events, user properties, and behavioral data streams that feed into various analytics modules.

**Amplitude Analytics** forms the core foundation, providing behavioral tracking through multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, Revenue LTV, User Sessions, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Compass, Personas, Journeys, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Data Tables, and Experiment Results. These charts leverage shared user identification systems (user_id, device_id) and event data for comprehensive behavioral analysis.

**Amplitude Experiment** integrates deeply with Analytics, sharing project structures and leveraging historical user data for enhanced targeting. The experimentation platform operates through deployments (client-side and server-side configurations) that contain feature flags and experiments utilizing consistent bucketing algorithms based on murmur3 hashing. The platform supports both remote evaluation (server-side processing with advanced targeting) and local evaluation (client-side processing for sub-millisecond performance).

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** capabilities include source and destination catalogs, audience management, and warehouse-native functionality. The platform provides data integration through various sources and destinations, with PII handling capabilities and comprehensive data governance features.

**Session Replay** integrates directly into organizational settings, allowing administrators to configure sample rates and manage session capture at the project level. **Guides and Surveys** extends beyond analytics into user engagement and feedback collection.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Analytics Concepts:**
- **Events**: User actions tracked within applications
- **Properties**: Attributes associated with events or users
- **Cohorts**: User segments based on behavioral criteria
- **Funnels**: Sequential user journey analysis
- **Retention**: User return behavior measurement
- **Segmentation**: Event-based behavioral analysis

**Experimentation Terminology:**
- **Bucketing Units**: Entity level for randomization (user_id, device_id, group identifiers)
- **Variants**: Different versions of features with associated values and JSON payloads
- **Allocation**: Percentage of users exposed to experiments
- **Exposure Events**: Tracked when users encounter feature flag variants
- **Assignment Events**: Server-side tracking of variant assignments
- **CUPED**: Controlled-experiment Using Pre-Experiment Data for variance reduction
- **Sequential Testing**: Statistical methodology allowing continuous monitoring without Type 1 error inflation
- **Sticky Bucketing**: Ensures users remain in same variant across sessions
- **Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE)**: Smallest reliably detectable metric change

**Organizational Structure:**
- **Organizations**: Top-level administrative boundary containing projects, users, billing
- **Projects**: Individual analytics implementations with dedicated API keys
- **Views**: Portfolio-created merged displays of multiple projects for cross-project analysis
- **Permission Groups**: Enterprise bulk user permission management
- **Team Spaces**: Collaborative workspaces for sharing analytics content
- **Deployments**: Experiment configurations with unique access keys

**Data Management:**
- **Dynamic Behavioral Sampling**: Scale feature's algorithmic event volume management
- **User Mapping API**: Cross-project user identity aliasing
- **SCIM 2.0 Provisioning**: Programmatic user and group management

## Product Ecosystem Integration

**Portfolio Functionality** enables Enterprise customers to perform cross-project analysis by creating Views that merge up to 5 projects (expandable to 10) into unified displays. This leverages user ID/device ID matching and the User Mapping API for aliasing different identifiers across project boundaries.

**Scale Feature** provides dynamic behavioral sampling for ultra-high volume Enterprise customers, implementing algorithmic sampling based on user identity while maintaining analysis accuracy through upsampling metrics.

The platform integrates with identity providers through **SSO provisioning** and **SCIM 2.0** support, enabling enterprise-grade user management workflows. **Slack integration** and **custom webhooks** provide notification delivery for collaborative analytics and real-time alerting.

**Ampli** provides type-safe analytics implementation with code generation for multiple programming languages, ensuring consistent event tracking across development teams.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Analytics APIs:**
- Analytics REST API v2.0 for event ingestion and data retrieval
- User Privacy API for GDPR/CCPA compliance and data deletion
- User Management API for SCIM 2.0 provisioning
- User Mapping API for cross-project identity aliasing

**Experiment APIs:**
- Experiment REST API for flag evaluation and variant assignment
- Management API for permission and configuration management
- Exposure tracking through Analytics REST API v2.0

**SDK Implementations:**
Multiple SDKs available for analytics and experimentation:
- **Analytics SDKs**: Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, Unreal
- **Experiment SDKs**: TypeScript, Kotlin, Objective-C, Swift, Python, and others

**Key SDK Methods:**
- `.track()`: Event tracking in Analytics SDKs
- `.variant()`: Experiment variant retrieval and exposure tracking
- User context passing through SDK initialization

**Configuration Endpoints:**
- Deployment-specific access keys for authentication
- Multi-user deployment support for complex organizational structures
- Self-service key management with 50 active key limits

## Administrative and Compliance Features

**User Roles**: Four-tier hierarchy (Viewer, Member, Manager, Admin) with project-level permissions for granular access control. Enterprise customers can implement Permission Groups for bulk user management.

**Data Management**: Self-service data deletion for Growth (1B events/month) and Enterprise (10B events/month) customers, with user privacy notifications for GDPR compliance including Job Creation, Completion, and Unset Violation notifications.

**Monitoring and Alerting**: Custom monitors with webhook integration for KPI-affecting behavior changes, Slack notifications for experiment results, and comprehensive diagnostic monitoring including sample ratio mismatch detection.

**International Support**: Currency display unit configuration, session definition configuration, time zone settings, and Japanese translation support for global implementations.

The platform supports enterprise-scale implementations with features like mutual exclusion groups, holdout controls, advanced statistical methodologies, and comprehensive integration capabilities across the modern data stack.
