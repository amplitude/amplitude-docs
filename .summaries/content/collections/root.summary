Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables product teams to understand user behavior, optimize experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Core Product Architecture

The platform is built around **Amplitude Analytics**, which provides behavioral analytics through event-based tracking. Users can analyze data through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Lifecycle analysis, Personas, Compass, Journeys, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Stickiness, Revenue LTV, Data Tables, and Experiment Results. Each chart type serves specific analytical purposes, from measuring user engagement to tracking conversion funnels and understanding user retention patterns.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers A/B testing and feature flagging capabilities with advanced techniques, experiment theory, workflow management, and comprehensive troubleshooting support. The platform includes "under the hood" technical documentation and integrates with various third-party tools.

**Session Replay** captures user interactions for qualitative analysis, while **Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user engagement and feedback collection. The **CDP** component manages data flow through source and destination catalogs, audience management, and warehouse-native integrations.

## SDK and API Ecosystem

Amplitude provides extensive instrumentation options through multiple SDKs and APIs. Analytics SDKs are available for major platforms including Android, iOS, Browser (JavaScript), React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine. Each SDK follows platform-specific implementation patterns while maintaining consistent event tracking capabilities.

The **Ampli** wrapper provides type-safe analytics implementation with code generation capabilities. **Experiment SDKs** enable feature flag and A/B test implementation across platforms.

API endpoints include the Analytics API for data ingestion and querying, Experiment APIs for managing feature flags and experiments, and Guides and Surveys API for in-product messaging. The platform also supports various integration APIs for connecting with external tools and services.

## Data Management and Governance

The platform implements comprehensive data governance through **Amplitude Data**, which includes tracking plan management, data validation, and quality controls. The system supports both real-time and batch data ingestion with specific routing patterns like `/apis/analytics/{slug}` for API documentation and `/data/{slug}` for data management features.

**Audiences** functionality enables behavioral cohort creation and management, while **Sources** and **Destinations** in the catalog provide extensive third-party integrations. The platform includes specialized **PII Integrations** for handling sensitive data with appropriate privacy controls.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

Administrative capabilities are organized under `/admin/{slug}` routes covering **Account Management**, **Billing and Use** tracking, and **Single Sign-on** configuration. The platform supports enterprise-grade security and compliance requirements.

**Partners** integration provides ecosystem connectivity, while **Agents** functionality enables automated workflows and integrations. The system includes comprehensive **FAQ and Troubleshooting** resources and **Migration** tools for platform transitions.

## Multi-language and Accessibility

The platform supports internationalization with **Japanese Translation** content available through dedicated site routing. Educational resources are provided through **Academy Content** for user onboarding and skill development.

## URL Structure and Navigation

The platform uses a hierarchical URL structure with clear product separation:
- `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/{slug}` for specific chart documentation
- `/sdks/{platform}/{slug}` for SDK-specific guidance  
- `/feature-experiment/{category}/{slug}` for experimentation features
- `/data/{category}/{slug}` for data management tools
- `/apis/{product}/{slug}` for API documentation

The system includes preview functionality with refresh capabilities and maintains consistent navigation through injected nav_title properties that organize content into logical product groupings like analytics, experiment, data, apis, and admin sections.

This architecture enables Amplitude to serve as a complete digital analytics ecosystem, supporting everything from basic event tracking to sophisticated experimentation and customer data management workflows.
