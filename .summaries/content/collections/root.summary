# Amplitude Documentation Product Overview

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics platform that helps businesses understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth. The documentation covers multiple products and features including:

1. **Analytics** - Core analytics platform for tracking and analyzing user behavior
2. **Experiment** - A/B testing and feature experimentation platform
3. **CDP** (Customer Data Platform) - Data management and audience segmentation
4. **SDKs** - Client and server libraries for various platforms
5. **APIs** - Programmatic interfaces for data access and management
6. **Session Replay** - Visual session recording and playback
7. **Data Management** - Tools for handling data sources, destinations, and PII

Key use cases include product analytics, user behavior tracking, experimentation, audience targeting, and data integration across the marketing and product tech stack.

## Product Relationships and Structure

The documentation is organized into several interconnected sections:

2. **SDKs and Implementation**
   - Platform-specific SDKs (iOS, Android, Web, React Native, Flutter, etc.)
   - Ampli (type-safe wrapper for SDKs)
   - Instrumentation guides

3. **Experimentation**
   - Experiment SDKs
   - Experiment APIs
   - Experiment Theory
   - Workflow guides
   - Advanced Techniques
   - Troubleshooting

4. **Data Management**
   - Sources (data ingestion)
   - Destinations (data export)
   - Audiences (user segmentation)
   - PII Integrations
   - CDP functionality

5. **Administration**
   - Account Management
   - Billing and Usage
   - Single Sign-On

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event** - A user action or system occurrence tracked in Amplitude
- **Property** - Metadata attached to events or users
- **User** - An individual using a product, identified by a User ID
- **Session** - A period of continuous user activity
- **Funnel** - A sequence of events representing a user journey
- **Cohort** - A group of users who share common characteristics
- **Segment** - A subset of users or events based on specific criteria
- **Experiment** - A controlled test comparing variations of a feature
- **Variant** - A specific version of a feature in an experiment
- **Source** - An origin point for data coming into Amplitude
- **Destination** - A system receiving data exported from Amplitude
- **Audience** - A defined group of users for targeting or analysis
- **Taxonomy** - The organizational structure of events and properties

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The documentation reveals how Amplitude's products work together:

1. **Analytics as the Core**
   - All other products build upon or integrate with the analytics platform
   - Charts and analysis tools provide insights from collected data

2. **Data Flow Architecture**
   - SDKs collect data from applications
   - Data is processed through the CDP
   - Analytics provides visualization and insights
   - Experiment uses data for targeting and measurement
   - Data can be exported to external destinations

3. **Cross-Product Features**
   - User identity management spans across products
   - Audiences created in CDP can be used in Experiment
   - Analytics insights inform experimentation strategy
   - Session Replay provides visual context for analytics data

4. **Integration with External Systems**
   - Source and destination catalogs enable connections with third-party tools
   - APIs allow programmatic access to Amplitude data and functionality
   - Warehouse-native integrations support direct data warehouse connections

## API Endpoints and Implementation Details

The documentation includes various implementation patterns:

### SDK Initialization
```javascript
// Browser SDK example
amplitude.init('API_KEY', {
  logLevel: 3,
  defaultTracking: true
});
```

### Event Tracking
```javascript
amplitude.track('Button Clicked', {
  buttonColor: 'blue',
  buttonText: 'Submit'
});
```

### Experiment Implementation
```javascript
// Fetch variant for a user
const variant = await experiment.fetch({
  user_id: 'user-123',
  flag_key: 'my-feature'
});

if (variant === 'on') {
  // Show new feature
}
```

### API Endpoints
- `/api/2/events` - Send events to Amplitude
- `/api/2/identify` - Update user properties
- `/api/2/export` - Export raw event data
- `/api/2/useractivity` - Get user activity data
- `/api/2/behavioralcohorts` - Manage behavioral cohorts

The documentation is structured to support different user roles (developers, analysts, product managers) and use cases, with specialized sections for implementation, analysis, and administration.
