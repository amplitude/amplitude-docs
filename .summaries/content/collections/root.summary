Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that enables product teams to understand user behavior, optimize experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Core Product Architecture

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, providing behavioral event tracking and analysis through multiple chart types including Event Segmentation (user action analysis), Funnel Analysis (conversion tracking), Retention Analysis (user return patterns), User Sessions (engagement measurement), Journeys (path analysis), Lifecycle (user state transitions), Stickiness (usage frequency), Personas (behavioral clustering), Compass (metric monitoring), Impact Analysis (feature impact), Revenue LTV (monetization tracking), Engagement Matrix (feature adoption), Data Tables (raw data exploration), and Experiment Results (A/B test analysis).

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced techniques for statistical analysis, experiment theory foundations, workflow management, troubleshooting tools, and comprehensive result analysis. The platform supports both client-side and server-side experimentation with real-time flag evaluation.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and reconstructs user sessions for qualitative analysis, enabling teams to understand user behavior beyond quantitative metrics through visual session playback and interaction analysis.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** delivers in-product user engagement through contextual messaging, feedback collection, and onboarding experiences with behavioral targeting and personalization capabilities.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation through source catalogs, destination catalogs, audience management, and warehouse-native integrations.

## Technical Implementation and SDKs

The platform supports comprehensive multi-platform instrumentation through dedicated SDKs:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser SDK (`@amplitude/analytics-browser`), Android SDK, iOS SDK, React Native SDK, Flutter SDK, Node.js SDK, Python SDK, Java SDK, Go SDK, Unity SDK, and Unreal SDK, each providing platform-specific event tracking, user identification, and configuration management.

**Experiment SDKs** offer feature flag evaluation and experiment assignment across all supported platforms with local evaluation capabilities and real-time flag updates.

**Ampli** provides type-safe analytics implementation through code generation, ensuring consistent event tracking across development teams with compile-time validation and IDE autocomplete support.

## API Infrastructure

**Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/`) provides programmatic access to event ingestion, user management, and data export with endpoints for batch event upload, user property updates, and historical data retrieval.

**Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) enable flag management, experiment configuration, and result analysis through RESTful endpoints supporting CRUD operations on flags, experiments, and targeting rules.

**Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) facilitates programmatic management of in-product messaging campaigns, survey deployment, and response collection.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events**: User actions tracked within applications (page views, button clicks, purchases) with associated properties and timestamps
**User Properties**: Persistent attributes describing users (demographics, subscription status, user type) that remain consistent across sessions
**Event Properties**: Contextual data associated with specific events (product category, price, location) providing additional analysis dimensions
**Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments based on behavioral criteria or property values, automatically updated as users meet or leave criteria
**Funnels**: Sequential event chains representing user conversion paths with step-by-step drop-off analysis
**Retention**: Measurement of user return behavior over specified time periods (daily, weekly, monthly) with cohort-based analysis
**Segments**: Filtered user groups based on event performance, property values, or behavioral patterns used for comparative analysis
**Flags**: Feature toggles controlling application behavior with percentage rollouts, user targeting, and A/B test variants
**Experiments**: Controlled tests comparing different user experiences with statistical significance testing and performance measurement
**Destinations**: External platforms receiving Amplitude data through CDP integrations (marketing tools, data warehouses, business intelligence platforms)
**Sources**: Data ingestion points feeding events into Amplitude (SDKs, server-side APIs, third-party integrations)

## Data Management and Governance

**Data Tables** provide SQL-like querying capabilities for raw event exploration with export functionality and custom analysis workflows.

**Audiences** enable sophisticated user segmentation with real-time updates and cross-platform activation through destination integrations.

**Sources and Destinations** facilitate comprehensive data ecosystem integration with 200+ pre-built connectors supporting marketing automation, data warehouses, business intelligence tools, and customer engagement platforms.

**Warehouse-native Amplitude** allows direct analysis of data warehouse tables without data movement, supporting Snowflake, BigQuery, and Redshift with native SQL query capabilities.

**PII Integrations** provide privacy-compliant data handling with encryption, tokenization, and regulatory compliance features for GDPR, CCPA, and other data protection requirements.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** includes user provisioning, role-based access control, team management, and organization-wide settings with SSO integration support.

**Single Sign-On** supports SAML 2.0, OIDC, and popular identity providers (Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace) with automated user provisioning and role mapping.

**Billing and Use** provides usage monitoring, plan management, event volume tracking, and cost optimization tools with detailed consumption analytics.

**Admin** section encompasses organization settings, data governance policies, security configurations, and compliance management tools.

## Developer Resources and Support

**Academy Content** offers comprehensive educational materials including implementation guides, best practices, analytics methodology, and certification programs.

**FAQ and Troubleshooting** provides extensive documentation for common issues, implementation challenges, and platform optimization techniques.

**Migration** resources support transitions from other analytics platforms with data mapping guides, SDK migration paths, and implementation validation tools.

**Partners** ecosystem includes certified implementation partners, technology integrations, and consulting services for enterprise deployments.

The platform supports multi-language documentation with Japanese translations and comprehensive agent-based support for enterprise customers. Route structures follow RESTful patterns with predictable URL schemes for documentation navigation and API endpoint organization.
