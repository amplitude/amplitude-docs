Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides AI-powered behavioral analytics, customer data management, and product optimization tools for product and growth teams. The platform combines real-time data interpretation with automated insights to help organizations understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive business growth.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem consists of several interconnected products that work together to provide end-to-end analytics and optimization capabilities:

**Core Analytics Platform** serves as the foundation, offering behavioral analytics with AI automation through Amplitude Agents. The analytics engine supports specialized analysis types including funnel analysis, retention analysis, event segmentation, user sessions, revenue LTV tracking, engagement matrices, impact analysis, user personas, stickiness analysis, and user journeys.

**Amplitude Data** functions as the data integration layer, providing warehouse-native capabilities, cross-device identity resolution, and customer/product data control. It includes a Customer Data Platform (CDP) with audience management and sources/destinations configuration for tech stack integration.

**Amplitude Experiment** handles feature management and experimentation, supporting feature flagging, A/B testing, multivariate experiments, and Multi-armed Bandit experiments. Web Experiment provides no-code experimentation capabilities with one-line JavaScript implementation.

**Session Replay** bridges quantitative and qualitative insights by recording user sessions that integrate with User Look-Up, Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Journeys, User Sessions, and Experiment charts, providing synchronized event streams and filtering capabilities.

**Guides and Surveys** enables in-product communication for user onboarding and feedback collection, serving as an alternative to traditional popup components while improving retention, activation, and engagement metrics.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Amplitude Agents**: AI-powered analytics assistant providing real-time data interpretation, proactive recommendations, workflow automation, and anomaly detection.

**Behavioral Analytics**: Analysis of user interactions and behaviors within products to understand usage patterns and optimize experiences.

**Event Segmentation**: Analysis method for breaking down user actions by various properties and dimensions.

**Funnel Analysis**: Tracking user progression through defined conversion paths to identify drop-off points and optimization opportunities.

**Revenue LTV**: Lifetime value analysis tracking long-term customer value and revenue attribution.

**Cross-device Identity Resolution**: Technology for connecting user interactions across multiple devices and touchpoints.

**Multi-armed Bandit**: Advanced experimentation method that dynamically allocates traffic to better-performing variants during the experiment.

**Ampli CLI and Ampli Wrapper**: Code-generated SDK tools providing type-safe tracking plan implementation with static type checking and autocomplete functionality.

## API Endpoints and Technical Integration

The platform provides comprehensive API access through several categories:

**Analytics and Data APIs** for programmatic access to behavioral data and analytics functionality.

**Experiment APIs** for managing feature flags, experiments, and remote configuration.

**Guides and Surveys Translation API** for internationalization and localization of in-product messaging.

Authentication is handled through multiple token types including org_api_key, org_secret_key, and SCIM tokens, with Postman collection integration available for API testing and development.

## SDK Ecosystem and Implementation

Amplitude offers extensive SDK support across client-side and server-side implementations:

**Analytics SDKs** for event tracking and behavioral data collection across multiple platforms and programming languages.

**Experiment SDKs** for feature flag evaluation and experiment participation.

**Session Replay SDK** for capturing user session recordings with autocapture events including Page Viewed, Element Clicked, and Element Changed events.

**Guides and Surveys SDK** for implementing in-product messaging and feedback collection.

The SDK ecosystem integrates with the Ampli CLI for generating type-safe, code-generated SDKs that provide static type checking and autocomplete functionality based on tracking plans.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

The platform includes comprehensive administrative capabilities covering billing, account management, and single sign-on (SSO) integration. Partner integrations extend the platform's capabilities through third-party connections and data sources.

The FAQ and troubleshooting documentation provides comprehensive support resources across all Amplitude products and features, helping users resolve common issues and optimize their implementation.
