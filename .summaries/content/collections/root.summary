# Amplitude Product Suite

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that helps organizations understand user behavior, optimize experiences, and drive business growth. The platform consists of several interconnected products:

1. **Analytics** - Core analytics capabilities for tracking, visualizing, and analyzing user behavior
2. **Experiment** - Feature experimentation and A/B testing platform
3. **CDP (Customer Data Platform)** - Data management and audience segmentation
4. **SDKs** - Client and server libraries for various platforms to instrument applications
5. **APIs** - Programmatic interfaces for data access and platform integration
6. **Account Management** - Administrative tools for managing organizations, projects, and users

The platform supports various visualization methods including charts, funnels, retention analysis, and session replay to provide comprehensive insights into user behavior.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Analytics Terminology
- **Event** - A discrete user action or system occurrence tracked in Amplitude
- **User** - An individual using a product, identified by a unique ID
- **Session** - A period of continuous user engagement
- **Funnel** - A sequence of events representing a user journey
- **Retention** - Measurement of user return behavior over time
- **Segmentation** - Dividing users based on properties or behaviors
- **Cohort** - A group of users who share common characteristics

### Experimentation Terminology
- **Experiment** - A controlled test comparing variations of a feature
- **Variant** - A specific version of a feature being tested
- **Control** - The baseline version in an experiment
- **Impact Analysis** - Measurement of experiment effects on key metrics

### Data Management Terminology
- **Source** - Origin point of data (e.g., website, mobile app)
- **Destination** - Target system receiving data from Amplitude
- **Audience** - A defined group of users meeting specific criteria
- **Integration** - Connection between Amplitude and external systems
- **Warehouse-Native** - Direct data loading via cloud storage without API keys

### SDK Terminology
- **Instrumentation** - Process of implementing tracking in applications
- **Ampli** - Type-safe wrapper for Amplitude SDKs
- **Identity** - System for tracking and reconciling user identifiers
