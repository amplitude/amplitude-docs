## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude platform components are tightly integrated:

1. **Data Collection** - SDKs and APIs capture data from various platforms and send it to Amplitude's servers
2. **Data Processing** - The platform processes, validates, and enriches incoming data
3. **Data Storage** - Information is stored in a structured format for analysis
4. **Analysis Tools** - Charts and visualization tools access the processed data
5. **Experimentation** - Experiment results feed back into analytics for impact measurement
6. **Data Export** - Processed data can be sent to external systems via destinations

The platform supports a complete analytics lifecycle from instrumentation through analysis to action, with each component designed to work seamlessly with others.

## API Endpoints and Commands

### SDK Initialization (varies by platform)
```javascript
// Browser SDK example
import * as amplitude from '@amplitude/analytics-browser';
amplitude.init('YOUR_API_KEY');
```

### Event Tracking
```javascript
// Track basic event
amplitude.track('Button Clicked');

// Track with properties
amplitude.track('Product Purchased', {
  price: 10.99,
  product_id: 'abc123'
});
```

### User Identification
```javascript
// Set user ID
amplitude.setUserId('user@example.com');

// Set user properties
amplitude.identify(
  new amplitude.Identify()
    .set('premium', true)
