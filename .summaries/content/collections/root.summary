# Amplitude Product Suite Documentation

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that helps businesses understand user behavior, optimize experiences, and make data-driven decisions. The platform consists of several integrated products:

1. **Analytics** - Core analytics platform for tracking user behavior and visualizing data through various charts and reports
2. **Experiment** - Feature experimentation and flag management platform for A/B testing and controlled rollouts
3. **CDP (Customer Data Platform)** - Data management solution for collecting, organizing, and activating customer data
4. **Ampli** - SDK framework for implementing Amplitude tracking with type safety and validation
5. **Session Replay** - Tool for capturing and analyzing user sessions

The platform supports multiple SDKs across various programming languages and platforms, including Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal, Node.js, Python, Java, and Go.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Amplitude ecosystem is organized into several interconnected components:

### Data Collection and Management
- **SDKs** provide instrumentation for different platforms to collect user behavior data
- **Sources** allow importing data from external systems into Amplitude
- **Destinations** enable exporting data from Amplitude to other tools
- **CDP** manages the flow of data between systems with PII handling capabilities

### Analysis and Visualization
- **Analytics Charts** include various visualization tools:
  - Event Segmentation
  - Funnel Analysis
  - Retention Analysis
  - User Sessions
  - Journeys
  - Impact Analysis
  - Personas
  - Lifecycle
  - Stickiness
  - Revenue LTV
  - Engagement Matrix
  - Compass
  - Legacy Charts

### Experimentation and Feature Management
- **Experiment** platform includes:
  - Feature flags and experiments
  - Web experiments
  - Server-side experiments
  - Experiment APIs for programmatic management
  - SDKs for experiment evaluation
  - Workflow tools for experiment management
  - Advanced techniques and theory documentation

### Administration and Account Management
- **Admin** section for platform configuration
- **Account Management** for user permissions and settings
- **Billing and Use** for subscription management
- **Single Sign-On** for enterprise authentication

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Analytics Terms
- **Event** - A user action or system occurrence tracked in Amplitude
- **User Property** - Attributes associated with users (demographics, preferences, etc.)
- **Session** - A period of continuous user activity
- **Funnel** - A sequence of events representing a user journey
- **Retention** - Measurement of users returning to the product over time
- **Cohort** - A group of users who share common characteristics
- **LTV (Lifetime Value)** - The predicted or actual value of a user over their lifetime

### Experimentation Terms
- **Experiment** - A test comparing different variants of a feature
- **Feature Flag** - A toggle that enables/disables features or serves different variants
- **Variant** - A specific version of a feature being tested
- **Deployment** - An environment where experiments or flags can be deployed
- **Mutex Group** - Ensures users are only included in one experiment from a set
- **Holdout Group** - A control group excluded from specific experiments
- **Bucketing** - Process of consistently assigning users to variants

### Data Management Terms
- **Source** - An origin point for data imported into Amplitude
- **Destination** - A target system where Amplitude data is exported
- **Audience** - A defined segment of users for targeting or analysis
- **PII (Personally Identifiable Information)** - Sensitive user data requiring special handling
- **Warehouse-Native** - Direct integration with data warehouses without API keys

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude platform components are designed to work together:

1. **Data Collection** - SDKs and sources feed data into the Amplitude platform
2. **Data Processing** - CDP manages, transforms, and routes data
3. **Analysis** - Analytics tools visualize and derive insights from the data
4. **Action** - Experiment enables testing and optimization based on insights
5. **Distribution** - Destinations allow activation of insights in other tools

The platform supports both client-side and server-side implementation patterns, with regional deployments for global compliance.

## API Endpoints and Implementation

### Analytics API
- Base URL: `/apis/analytics/{endpoint}`
- Provides programmatic access to Amplitude analytics data

### Experiment API
- Evaluation API: `GET /api/2/variantAssignments`
- Management API endpoints:
  - `/experiments` - Manage experiments
  - `/flags` - Manage feature flags
  - `/deployments` - Manage environments
  - `/mutexes` - Manage mutex groups
  - `/holdouts` - Manage holdout groups
  - `/versions` - Track configuration changes

### SDK Implementation
Each SDK follows a similar pattern for implementation:
1. Installation via package manager
2. Initialization with API key
3. Event tracking through method calls
4. User identification and property setting
5. Optional configuration for advanced features

The Ampli SDK framework provides additional type safety and validation through generated tracking libraries based on a tracking plan.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into several collections:
- Product-specific documentation (Analytics, Experiment, CDP, etc.)
- SDK documentation for each supported platform
- API reference documentation
- Implementation guides and best practices
- Troubleshooting and FAQ resources
- Migration guides for platform updates

Each section includes relevant templates, layouts, and navigation structures to help users find information efficiently.
