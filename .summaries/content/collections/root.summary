Amplitude Guides and Surveys is a comprehensive in-product user experience platform that enables product teams to create contextual user guidance, collect feedback, and improve onboarding through interactive guides, targeted surveys, and a centralized resource center. The platform integrates deeply with Amplitude's analytics ecosystem while supporting multi-platform deployment across web, iOS, Android, and React Native applications.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The platform consists of three interconnected core components:

**Guides** serve as the primary user onboarding and feature discovery mechanism, offering five distinct form factors: Modal (overlay dialogs), Popover (contextual bubbles), Pin (persistent elements), Tooltip (hover information), and Banner (top/bottom bars). Each form factor supports multi-step experiences with customizable positioning and interactive blocks including buttons, images, and videos. Guides utilize five template types (Tour, Announcement, Checklists, Banners, Tooltips) and incorporate sophisticated behavioral triggers, strike detection for interaction pattern analysis, and rate-limiting mechanisms to optimize user experience.

**Surveys** enable targeted feedback collection through four specialized block types: Rating (Stars, NPS, Emoji, Rating labels), Long answer, Short answer, and List blocks. Surveys support conditional logic for dynamic response paths and utilize a subset of guide form factors (modal, popover, pin). Analysis capabilities include aggregate metrics through the Insights tab and granular individual response data via the Responses tab.

**Resource Center** functions as an integrated help widget that works with the Guides and Surveys SDK to provide search functionality, recommended content, quick links, and call-to-action buttons. The Resource Center features Autopilot functionality that leverages semantic search to automatically generate content recommendations from documentation repositories.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**AmplitudeEngagement** - The core SDK class responsible for initializing and managing guides and surveys across all supported platforms

**Form Factors** - Visual presentation styles that determine how content appears to users: Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner, and Checklist

**Behavioral Triggers** - Event-based activation mechanisms including element appearance/clicks, time delays, smart delay, rage click detection, user confusion patterns, and custom event tracking

**Strike Detection** - Advanced system for tracking and analyzing user interaction patterns to optimize guide timing, relevance, and effectiveness

**Rate-limiting/Throttling** - Sophisticated controls for managing guide and survey frequency per user across different time periods (day/week/month/session) to prevent user fatigue

**Lifecycle UUID** - Unique identifier system for tracking user progression through complete guide and survey experiences

**Variant ID** - Identifier used for A/B testing and experimentation within Amplitude Experiment integration

**Recommendation Sets** - Curated collections of articles and content for the Resource Center, configurable with advanced targeting rules and priority levels

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Guides and Surveys integrates comprehensively with Amplitude's product ecosystem:

**Analytics Integration**: Automatic event tracking in Amplitude Analytics with detailed event properties including Guide Engaged, Guide Step Completed, Survey Submitted, Survey Abandoned, and Tooltip Marker Viewed events. Integration with Microscope provides session replay capabilities for analyzing user interactions with guides and surveys.

**Amplitude Experiment Integration**: Full support for A/B testing and multi-armed bandit experiments on guides and surveys, including variant configuration, exposure event handling, and performance analytics through the insights dashboard.

**Third-party Integrations**: Compatible with Segment analytics, Google Tag Manager, and other analytics providers through the `forwardEvent()` method for comprehensive event tracking across platforms.

**Multi-platform SDK Support**: Unified experience across web (`@amplitude/engagement-browser`), iOS (AmplitudeEngagement-Swift), Android (amplitude-engagement-android), and React Native (`@amplitude/plugin-engagement-react-native`) platforms with consistent API patterns.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Core SDK Methods**:
- `engagement.init()` and `engagement.boot()` for platform initialization
- `engagement.gs.show()` and `engagement.gs.reset()` for guide lifecycle management
- `engagement.forwardEvent()` for cross-platform event tracking
- `engagement.setRouter()` for single-page application routing integration
- `engagement.updateLanguage()` for dynamic localization support

**Mobile SDK Methods**:
- `AmplitudeEngagement.initialize()` with API key configuration
- `boot()` with user/device ID and properties for session initialization
- `show()`, `reset()`, `list()` for comprehensive guide management
- `handlePreviewLinkIntent()` for preview mode testing and validation

**Resource Center API Patterns**:
- `/sdk/*` path pattern for API routing through proxy configurations
- `/sdk/admin/config` endpoint for preview mode functionality
- Website scraper functionality for automated content repository synchronization

**Configuration Options**:
- ServerZone selection (US/EU) for data residency compliance
- Proxy setup with `serverUrl` and `cdnUrl` for enterprise deployments
- Content Security Policy (CSP) nonce support for security compliance
- Theme management with `ThemeMode` (lightMode, darkMode, auto) for user preference alignment

The platform includes comprehensive permission management with five distinct access levels (No access, Viewer, Member, Manager, Administrator), extensive localization support through SDK locale configuration and XLIFF file workflows, and advanced targeting capabilities using segments, cohorts, page rules, and priority levels. Testing is facilitated through preview mode with condition verification, and the system supports template creation for reusable guide and survey configurations across organizations.
