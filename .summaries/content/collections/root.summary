Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools for product analytics, behavioral experimentation, feature management, and customer data management. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products designed to help teams understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and make data-driven decisions.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform is built around several primary products: **Amplitude Analytics** for behavioral analytics and user insights, **Amplitude Experiment** for A/B testing and feature flag management, **Amplitude CDP** (Customer Data Platform) for data collection and routing, **Session Replay** for user session recording and analysis, and **Guides and Surveys** for in-product messaging and user feedback collection.

The system operates through a multi-tenant architecture supporting both English (`en`) and Japanese (`jp`) localization, with content propagation controls and site-specific configurations. The platform uses a hierarchical data model structured around organizations, projects, and various data entities including events, users, cohorts, and experiments.

## Analytics and Charting Capabilities

Amplitude Analytics provides extensive charting and analysis capabilities through multiple specialized chart types:

- **Event Segmentation**: Core behavioral analysis tracking user actions and properties
- **Funnel Analysis**: Conversion tracking through multi-step user journeys  
- **Retention Analysis**: User return behavior and engagement measurement
- **User Sessions**: Session-based analytics and user flow analysis
- **Journeys**: User path analysis and behavioral flow visualization
- **Compass**: Automated insights and anomaly detection
- **Personas**: User segmentation and behavioral clustering
- **Lifecycle**: User lifecycle stage analysis and progression tracking
- **Stickiness**: Feature usage frequency and engagement depth
- **Revenue LTV**: Customer lifetime value and revenue analytics
- **Impact Analysis**: Feature impact measurement and correlation analysis
- **Engagement Matrix**: Multi-dimensional user engagement analysis
- **Data Tables**: Raw data exploration and custom metric calculation
- **Experiment Results**: A/B test performance analysis and statistical evaluation

Each chart type supports advanced filtering, segmentation, and comparative analysis capabilities with real-time data processing and historical trend analysis.

## Experimentation and Feature Management

**Amplitude Experiment** operates through two evaluation modes: remote evaluation (server-side with advanced targeting) and local evaluation (client-side with sub-millisecond performance). The platform supports both statistical experimentation with hypothesis testing and progressive feature delivery through feature flags.

Key experimentation concepts include:
- **Deployment Keys**: Authentication tokens for client-side and server-side implementations
- **Flag Keys**: Unique identifiers for feature flags using kebab-case naming
- **Variants**: Experiment variations containing values and payload configurations
- **Bucketing Units**: User assignment entities (user_id, device_id, or custom groups)
- **Allocation**: Percentage-based user exposure controls
- **Targeting Segments**: Advanced user targeting through cohorts and properties

The experimentation workflow encompasses hypothesis formation, metric selection, variant creation, user allocation through consistent hashing (murmur3 algorithm), and comprehensive statistical analysis using sequential testing or T-test methodologies.

## SDK and Integration Ecosystem

The platform provides comprehensive SDK support across multiple platforms and languages:

**Analytics SDKs**: Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine implementations with consistent initialization patterns and automatic event tracking capabilities.

**Experiment SDKs**: Multi-platform support for feature flag evaluation and experiment participation with both synchronous and asynchronous evaluation modes.

**Framework Integrations**: Specialized integrations for popular development frameworks and platforms.

**Ampli**: Type-safe analytics implementation tool that generates strongly-typed tracking libraries from centralized tracking plans.

## Data Management and Customer Data Platform

**Amplitude CDP** provides comprehensive data collection, transformation, and routing capabilities through:

- **Sources**: Data ingestion from various platforms and services through the Source Catalog
- **Destinations**: Data export and synchronization through the Destination Catalog  
- **Audiences**: Dynamic user segmentation and cohort management
- **Data Tables**: Custom data storage and analysis capabilities
- **Warehouse-native Amplitude**: Direct data warehouse integration and analysis

The platform supports extensive **PII (Personally Identifiable Information) integrations** with privacy-compliant data handling and user consent management.

## API Infrastructure

The platform exposes multiple API endpoints for programmatic access:

- **Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/`): Event ingestion, user properties, and behavioral data access
- **Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`): Feature flag management, variant assignment, and experiment configuration
- **Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`): In-product messaging and survey management

APIs support RESTful operations with comprehensive authentication, rate limiting, and webhook capabilities for real-time data synchronization.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

The platform includes comprehensive administrative capabilities:

- **Account Management**: User provisioning, role-based access controls, and organizational settings
- **Single Sign-On**: Enterprise authentication integration with SAML and OAuth providers
- **Billing and Usage**: Consumption tracking, plan management, and usage analytics
- **Project-level Permissions**: Granular access controls independent from Analytics permissions

Enterprise features include experiment approval workflows, advanced governance controls, Slack and webhook notifications, and comprehensive audit logging.

## Specialized Products and Add-ons

**Session Replay** provides user session recording and analysis capabilities with privacy controls and performance optimization features.

**Guides and Surveys** enables in-product messaging, user onboarding flows, and feedback collection with targeting and personalization capabilities.

**Agents** (emerging capability) appears to provide automated analysis and insights generation.

## Migration and Troubleshooting Support

The platform includes comprehensive migration tools for transitioning from other analytics platforms, with detailed guides for data mapping, SDK replacement, and feature parity validation.

Extensive troubleshooting documentation covers common implementation issues, debugging techniques, and performance optimization strategies across all product areas.

## Partner Ecosystem and Integrations

Amplitude maintains an extensive partner ecosystem with pre-built integrations for popular marketing, product, and data tools. The integration catalog includes both source and destination connectors, enabling seamless data flow between Amplitude and other business-critical systems.

The platform's architecture supports both real-time and batch data processing, with flexible data routing capabilities that allow organizations to maintain their existing data infrastructure while leveraging Amplitude's advanced analytics and experimentation capabilities.
