## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude platform is designed as an integrated ecosystem:

1. **Data Foundation** - The CDP forms the foundation, managing data collection and identity resolution
2. **Analytics Layer** - Built on the data foundation, transforms raw data into insights
3. **Activation Layer** - Experiment, Guides and Surveys enable teams to act on insights
4. **Cross-Product Integration** - Session Replay provides qualitative context to quantitative data

This integration enables workflows like:
- Identifying opportunities in Analytics
- Creating experiments to test solutions
- Measuring impact with the same analytics tools
- Engaging users with targeted in-app messaging

## API and SDK Implementation

### API Endpoints
Amplitude offers several API categories:
- **Analytics APIs** - `/apis/analytics/...`
- **Experiment APIs** - `/apis/experiment/...`
- **Guides and Surveys API** - `/apis/guides-and-surveys/...`

Authentication uses various credentials:
- API Key (public identifier)
- Secret Key (private credential)
- Deployment Keys (for Experiment)
- Management API Key (for Experiment configuration)
- Data API Token (for Data APIs)

### SDK Implementation
Amplitude provides SDKs for multiple platforms, organized into:
1. **Analytics SDKs** - For sending event data
2. **Experiment SDKs** - For implementing feature flags
3. **Session Replay SDKs** - For capturing sessions
4. **Guides and Surveys SDKs** - For in-app messaging

The documentation includes implementation guides for each SDK, with platform-specific instructions and best practices.

The Ampli CLI and wrapper provide type-safe event tracking based on Tracking Plans, ensuring data quality and consistency across implementations.
