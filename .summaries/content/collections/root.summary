Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools for product analytics, feature experimentation, customer data management, and in-product user engagement. The platform serves as an integrated ecosystem for understanding user behavior, optimizing product experiences, and driving business growth through data-driven decision making.

## Core Product Architecture

The Amplitude platform consists of several interconnected products that work together to provide end-to-end analytics and optimization capabilities:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational product for behavioral analytics, offering multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Compass, Personas, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, Revenue LTV, Data Tables, and Experiment Results. Each chart type provides specialized analysis capabilities with dedicated routes like `/analytics/charts/funnel-analysis/` and `/analytics/charts/retention-analysis/`.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities through routes like `/feature-experiment/` with specialized sections for Advanced Techniques (`/feature-experiment/advanced-techniques/`), Experiment Theory (`/feature-experiment/experiment-theory/`), Under the Hood (`/feature-experiment/under-the-hood/`), Workflow (`/feature-experiment/workflow/`), and Troubleshooting (`/feature-experiment/troubleshooting/`).

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user sessions for qualitative insights, accessible through `/session-replay/` routes with dedicated blade identification as "Amplitude Session Replay".

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** delivers in-product user experiences through `/guides-and-surveys/` routes, branded as "Amplitude Guides and Surveys" for creating contextual onboarding and feedback collection experiences.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation through `/data/` routes, including Sources (`/data/sources/`), Audiences (`/data/audiences/`), Source Catalog (`/data/source-catalog/`), Destination Catalog (`/data/destination-catalog/`), and Warehouse-native Amplitude (`/data/warehouse-native/`).

## SDK and API Ecosystem

The platform provides extensive SDK support across multiple programming languages and platforms:

**Analytics SDKs** include dedicated implementations for Browser (`/sdks/analytics/browser/`), Android (`/sdks/analytics/android/`), iOS (`/sdks/analytics/ios/`), React Native (`/sdks/analytics/react-native/`), Flutter (`/sdks/analytics/flutter/`), Node.js (`/sdks/analytics/node/`), Python (`/sdks/analytics-sdks/python/`), Java (`/sdks/analytics/java/`), Go (`/sdks/analytics/go/`), Unity (`/sdks/analytics/unity/`), and Unreal (`/sdks/analytics/unreal/`).

**Experiment SDKs** are available through `/sdks/experiment-sdks/` routes for implementing feature flags and experiments across different platforms.

**Ampli** provides a code-generation tool accessible through `/sdks/ampli/` routes for type-safe analytics implementation.

**API Infrastructure** includes Analytics API (`/apis/analytics/`), Experiment APIs (`/apis/experiment/`), and Guides and Surveys API (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) for programmatic access to platform functionality.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Collections** represent the primary organizational structure for documentation, with each collection corresponding to a specific product area or feature set. Collections use YAML configuration files defining routing patterns, navigation injection, and content organization.

**Mount Points** are unique identifiers (UUIDs) that link collections to specific content repositories, enabling modular content management across the platform.

**Navigation Injection** uses the `inject.nav_title` property to organize content within the documentation hierarchy, with values like `analytics`, `experiment`, `data`, `apis`, `analytics_sdks`, `experiment_sdks`, and `admin`.

**Blade Identification** uses the `inject.blade` property to specify product branding, with values like "Amplitude Experiment", "Amplitude Session Replay", and "Amplitude Guides and Surveys".

**Route Patterns** define URL structures using variables like `{slug}`, `{permalink}`, `{{section}}`, and `{parent_uri}` for dynamic content routing.

**Date Behavior** controls content visibility with `past: public` and `future: private` settings for managing content publication schedules.

**Site Propagation** manages multi-language support through `sites` arrays (en, jp) and `propagate` boolean flags for content distribution.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** (`/admin/account-management/`) provides organizational controls for user access and permissions.

**Billing and Use** (`/admin/billing-use/`) offers usage monitoring and subscription management capabilities.

**Single Sign-on** (`/admin/single-sign-on/`) enables enterprise authentication integration.

**PII Integrations** (`/data/pii/`) provide privacy-compliant data handling for personally identifiable information.

**Migration** (`/migration/`) supports platform transitions and data migration workflows.

## Integration and Partnership Ecosystem

**Partners** (`/partners/`) documentation covers third-party integrations and partnership opportunities within the Amplitude ecosystem.

**Source and Destination Catalogs** use taxonomy-based organization through `integration_category` classifications for data pipeline management.

**Web Experiment** (`/web-experiment/`) provides specialized experimentation capabilities for web-based implementations.

**Legacy Charts** (`/analytics/charts/legacy-charts/`) maintain backward compatibility for deprecated visualization types.

## Content Management and Localization

**Japanese Translation** (`/japanese_translation.yaml`) provides localized content through dedicated site configuration with `sites: [jp]` and specialized navigation injection.

**Academy Content** serves educational resources through dedicated collection management.

**FAQ and Troubleshooting** (`/faq/`) centralizes support documentation across all product areas.

**Sections** (`/sections.yaml`) provide top-level navigation structure with `route: '/{slug}'` patterns and table-of-contents hiding through `inject.hide_toc: true`.

The platform architecture demonstrates a sophisticated content management system built around collection-based organization, with each product area maintaining dedicated routing, navigation, and branding while integrating into a cohesive documentation ecosystem. The extensive SDK support, API availability, and administrative features position Amplitude as an enterprise-grade analytics platform capable of supporting complex organizational requirements across multiple products and use cases.
