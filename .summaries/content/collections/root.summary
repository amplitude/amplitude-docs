Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive data-driven decision making across web and mobile applications.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of four primary product areas that work together to provide end-to-end analytics and optimization capabilities:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational data collection and analysis engine, capturing user interactions through event-based tracking and providing visualization through multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, Stickiness, Revenue LTV, and Legacy Charts.

**Amplitude Experiment** enables feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced statistical analysis, supporting experiment design, implementation, results analysis, and advanced techniques for optimization. The platform includes dedicated experiment theory documentation and troubleshooting resources.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and reconstructs user interactions through video-like session recordings, providing visual insights into user behavior patterns and experience optimization opportunities.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** facilitates in-product user engagement through targeted messaging, onboarding flows, and feedback collection mechanisms.

## Data Infrastructure and Integration Ecosystem

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** capabilities include comprehensive data management through Sources (data ingestion), Destinations (data activation), Audiences (user segmentation), and Warehouse-native Amplitude for direct data warehouse integration. The platform supports extensive third-party integrations through Source and Destination catalogs with integration category taxonomies.

**Multi-Platform SDK Support** provides instrumentation capabilities across diverse technology stacks:
- **Mobile SDKs**: Android, iOS, Flutter, React Native, Unity, Unreal Engine
- **Web SDKs**: Browser JavaScript with framework-specific integrations
- **Server-Side SDKs**: Node.js, Python, Java, Go
- **Code Generation**: Ampli provides type-safe, auto-generated tracking libraries

**API Infrastructure** exposes programmatic access through Analytics APIs, Experiment APIs, and Guides and Surveys APIs, enabling custom integrations and automated workflows.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events and Properties**: The fundamental data model consists of events (user actions) with associated properties (contextual attributes), forming the basis for all analytics and experimentation analysis.

**Sessions and Users**: User identification and session management provide continuity across interactions, with device ID and user ID tracking enabling cross-platform user journey analysis.

**Cohorts and Audiences**: User segmentation capabilities allow creation of behavioral cohorts and audiences for targeted analysis and activation.

**Feature Flags and Experiments**: Controlled feature rollouts and statistical testing frameworks with variant assignment, exposure tracking, and results analysis.

**Charts and Dashboards**: Pre-built visualization templates optimized for specific analytical use cases, from basic event tracking to complex behavioral analysis.

**Integrations and Destinations**: Third-party platform connections enabling data sharing, activation, and workflow automation across marketing, product, and analytics tools.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** includes user provisioning, role-based access control, and organizational structure management. **Billing and Use** tracking provides usage monitoring and cost management capabilities.

**Single Sign-On (SSO)** integration supports enterprise authentication systems, while comprehensive **Admin** functionality enables platform configuration and governance.

**Migration** tools and documentation facilitate platform transitions and data portability, supporting organizations moving from other analytics providers.

## Developer and Implementation Resources

**Get Started** documentation provides onboarding guidance and implementation best practices. **FAQ and Troubleshooting** resources address common implementation challenges and platform usage questions.

**Academy Content** offers educational materials and training resources for platform proficiency development.

**Partners** ecosystem includes certified implementation partners and technology integrations, extending platform capabilities through third-party expertise and tools.

**Framework Integrations** provide pre-built connectors for popular development frameworks, reducing implementation complexity and time-to-value.

The platform supports multi-language documentation with Japanese translation capabilities and maintains comprehensive API documentation with specific endpoint references, command-line invocations, and integration patterns across all product areas.
