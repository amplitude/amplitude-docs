## Amplitude Documentation Platform

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides product teams with tools for user behavior analysis, feature experimentation, data management, and customer engagement. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Product Architecture and Relationships

### Core Analytics Platform
The **Analytics** product serves as the foundation, offering multiple chart types for data visualization including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, Revenue LTV, and Experiment Results. These charts are organized under `/analytics/charts/` routes and share common navigation structures.

### Experimentation Suite
**Amplitude Experiment** provides A/B testing and feature flagging capabilities through several components:
- Core experiment management at `/feature-experiment/`
- Advanced techniques for sophisticated testing scenarios
- Experiment theory and statistical foundations
- Under-the-hood technical implementation details
- Workflow management for experiment lifecycle
- Dedicated troubleshooting resources
- Integration capabilities with third-party platforms

### Data Management Ecosystem
The **CDP (Customer Data Platform)** handles data ingestion, transformation, and activation through:
- **Sources** - Data collection from various platforms via the Source Catalog
- **Destinations** - Data activation through the Destination Catalog with integration categories
- **Audiences** - User segmentation and targeting capabilities
- **Warehouse-native Amplitude** - Direct data warehouse integration
- **PII Integrations** - Privacy-compliant data handling

### Developer Tools and SDKs
The platform provides extensive SDK support organized into:
- **Analytics SDKs** - Platform-specific tracking libraries (Android, iOS, Browser, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, Unreal)
- **Experiment SDKs** - Feature flagging and experimentation libraries
- **Ampli** - Code generation tool for type-safe analytics implementation
- **SDK Catalog** - Comprehensive SDK documentation and guides

### Additional Products
- **Session Replay** - User session recording and analysis
- **Guides and Surveys** - In-product messaging and feedback collection
- **Agents** - AI-powered analytics assistance

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Content Management Structure
- **Collections** - Organized content groupings with specific routing patterns
- **Sites** - Multi-language support (en, jp) with propagation controls
- **Mount** - Content mounting system using UUID identifiers for hierarchical organization
- **Revisions** - Version control system (disabled across most collections)
- **Taxonomies** - Content categorization system, particularly for integration catalogs

### Navigation and Routing
- **nav_title** - Navigation categorization (analytics, experiment, data, apis, etc.)
- **blade** - Product branding injection (Amplitude Experiment, Amplitude Session Replay, etc.)
- **route** - URL pattern definition with slug-based dynamic routing
- **preview_targets** - Content preview system with permalink generation
- **structure.root** - Hierarchical content organization control

### Content Behavior
- **date_behavior** - Publication control (past: public, future: private)
- **sort_dir** - Content ordering (ascending by default)
- **propagate** - Multi-site content distribution control
- **inject** - Dynamic content injection for navigation and branding

### Integration Categories
- **integration_category** - Taxonomy for Source and Destination Catalog organization
- **Partners** - Third-party integration ecosystem

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The documentation platform reflects Amplitude's position as an integrated product analytics ecosystem where:

**Analytics** serves as the central hub, connecting to all other products through shared event data and user identification. Charts and dashboards provide insights that inform experimentation strategies and audience segmentation.

**Experiment** integrates deeply with Analytics for results measurement, using the same event tracking infrastructure and providing dedicated Experiment Results charts within the Analytics suite.

**CDP** functions as the data backbone, ingesting events from Analytics SDKs and distributing insights to downstream tools through the Destination Catalog, while the Source Catalog enables data collection from external platforms.

**Session Replay** enhances Analytics insights by providing qualitative context to quantitative metrics, sharing user identification and session management.

**Guides and Surveys** leverages Analytics data for targeting and Experiment for optimization, creating a feedback loop for product improvement.
