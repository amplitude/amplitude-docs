Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, run sophisticated experiments, and make data-driven product decisions. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP), all unified through shared user identification, event tracking, and data infrastructure.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The platform operates through a multi-layered architecture where **Analytics** serves as the foundational data collection and analysis layer, capturing user events through various SDKs (Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, Unreal) and the Analytics API. This data feeds into multiple analysis tools including **Charts** (Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Personas, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Revenue LTV, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Compass, Data Tables) that provide different analytical perspectives on user behavior.

**Amplitude Experiment** builds upon this analytics foundation, utilizing user cohorts and behavioral data for sophisticated targeting in A/B tests and feature flag deployments. The experimentation platform supports both client-side and server-side implementations through dedicated Experiment SDKs and APIs, with results feeding back into specialized Experiment Results charts for statistical analysis.

**Session Replay** captures user interactions for qualitative analysis, while **Guides and Surveys** enables in-product messaging and feedback collection. The **CDP** component manages data flow through Sources and Destinations, with extensive integration catalogs supporting data ingestion and activation across the marketing and analytics technology stack.

**Ampli** serves as a type-safe wrapper around analytics SDKs, providing code generation and validation for consistent event tracking across development teams.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events**: User actions tracked through the platform, forming the basis for all analytics and experimentation targeting. Events contain properties and are associated with user identities.

**Charts**: Specialized analytical views including Event Segmentation (trend analysis), Funnel Analysis (conversion tracking), Retention Analysis (user return patterns), Journeys (user path analysis), and Personas (behavioral clustering).

**Cohorts/Audiences**: User segments defined by behavioral criteria, properties, or engagement patterns, used for targeting in experiments and marketing activation.

**Deployments**: Configuration containers in Amplitude Experiment that house access keys, evaluation modes, and serve as the organizational unit for experiments and feature flags.

**Variants**: Different versions within experiments, including control and treatment groups, each with configurable traffic allocation and payload data.

**Bucketing**: The process of consistently assigning users to experiment variants based on user identifiers, ensuring stable assignment across sessions.

**Evaluation Modes**: Remote evaluation (real-time server queries) vs Local evaluation (cached configurations for offline processing) in the experimentation platform.

**Sources and Destinations**: CDP components where Sources bring data into Amplitude from external systems, while Destinations send Amplitude data to downstream tools and platforms.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude operates as a unified platform where user identification (user_id, device_id) and event data flow seamlessly between products. Analytics data informs experiment targeting through cohorts and user properties, while experiment exposure events feed back into analytics for comprehensive analysis. Session Replay provides qualitative context for quantitative analytics insights, and Guides and Surveys enable direct user feedback collection based on behavioral triggers.

The CDP serves as the data backbone, ingesting data from various sources through the Source Catalog (including warehouse-native connections) and activating insights through the Destination Catalog. This creates a closed-loop system where data collection, analysis, experimentation, and activation work in concert.

**Multi-site support** enables organizations to manage multiple properties (English and Japanese sites mentioned) with shared or isolated configurations, while **Partner integrations** extend platform capabilities through third-party tools and services.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

The platform provides comprehensive API coverage across products:

- **Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/`) for event ingestion and data retrieval
- **Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) for flag evaluation and experiment management  
- **Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) for in-product messaging control

**SDK implementations** span multiple platforms with consistent interfaces:
- Client-side: Browser, Android (`/sdks/analytics/android/`), iOS (`/sdks/analytics/ios/`), React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal
- Server-side: Node.js (`/sdks/analytics/node/`), Python, Java, Go
- Specialized: Ampli (`/sdks/ampli/`) for type-safe implementations

**Administrative capabilities** include account management (`/admin/account-management/`), billing and usage monitoring (`/admin/billing-use/`), and single sign-on configuration (`/admin/single-sign-on/`).

The platform supports advanced features like **PII integrations** for privacy-compliant data handling, **warehouse-native** implementations for direct data warehouse analysis, and comprehensive **troubleshooting and FAQ** resources. Migration tools facilitate transitions from other analytics platforms, while the Academy Content provides educational resources for platform adoption and best practices.
