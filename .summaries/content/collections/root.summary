Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with behavioral data analysis, A/B testing, and user engagement tools through an integrated ecosystem of analytics, experimentation, and data management products.

## High-Level Product Overview

Amplitude operates as a multi-product platform centered around understanding user behavior and optimizing digital experiences. The core offering includes **Amplitude Analytics** for behavioral event tracking and visualization, **Amplitude Experiment** for A/B testing and feature flagging, **Amplitude Session Replay** for user session recording, and **Amplitude Guides and Surveys** for in-product user engagement. The platform serves businesses from Growth to Enterprise tiers with sophisticated data collection, analysis, and experimentation capabilities.

The platform's architecture follows a hierarchical structure where **Organizations** contain multiple **Projects**, each representing individual products or applications. Projects maintain independent API keys, session definitions, time zones, and user management while supporting cross-project analysis through **Portfolio Views** for Enterprise customers.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

The Amplitude ecosystem demonstrates deep integration across its product suite. **Analytics** serves as the foundational data layer, capturing user events through comprehensive SDKs (Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, Unreal) and feeding behavioral data to other platform components.

**Experiment** leverages Analytics data for enhanced targeting through cohort membership, user properties, and behavioral segmentation. The experimentation platform supports both remote and local evaluation modes, with remote evaluation providing full user enrichment capabilities including Amplitude ID resolution, IP geolocation, and historical property access.

**Session Replay** integrates with Analytics event streams to provide visual context for behavioral data, while **Guides and Surveys** enables in-product engagement measurement and feedback collection that feeds back into the analytics pipeline.

The **Data** layer encompasses source and destination catalogs, audience management, and warehouse-native capabilities, creating a comprehensive customer data platform (CDP) that extends beyond basic analytics into data activation and integration workflows.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Event Tracking Architecture:**
- **Events**: User actions captured through SDK implementations with associated properties and timestamps
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes associated with users across sessions
- **Event Properties**: Contextual data specific to individual event occurrences
- **Amplitude ID**: Platform-generated unique identifier enabling cross-device user tracking
- **Device ID**: Browser or device-specific identifier for anonymous user tracking

**Analytics Terminology:**
- **Segmentation**: User categorization based on behavioral patterns and properties
- **Cohorts**: Dynamic or static user groups based on shared characteristics or behaviors
- **Funnels**: Sequential step analysis measuring conversion rates and drop-off points
- **Retention**: Measurement of user return behavior over specified time periods
- **Revenue LTV**: Lifetime value analysis tracking monetization patterns for user cohorts

**Experimentation Framework:**
- **Variants**: Different treatment conditions within experiments containing values and payloads
- **Bucketing**: Consistent algorithm determining user variant assignment using murmur3 hashing
- **Allocation**: Percentage of users exposed to experiments with variant distribution weights
- **Sequential Testing**: Statistical methodology enabling continuous monitoring with early stopping capabilities
- **CUPED**: Controlled-experiment Using Pre-Experiment Data for variance reduction

**Data Management:**
- **Ampli**: Code generation tool creating strongly-typed tracking APIs from Data tracking plans
- **Taxonomy**: Organized event and property schema management system
- **Sources/Destinations**: Data ingestion and activation endpoints in the CDP architecture

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates extensively with external systems through multiple integration layers. **Identity providers** connect via SSO and SCIM 2.0 for enterprise user management, while **webhook systems** enable real-time notifications to external endpoints. The platform supports **marketing attribution** through comprehensive UTM parameter tracking and click ID monitoring for major advertising platforms.

**Data residency** options include US and EU server zones for compliance requirements, with **privacy frameworks** supporting GDPR, CCPA, and other regulatory requirements through automated data deletion workflows and consent management.

The **Partner ecosystem** includes integrations with major marketing, analytics, and business intelligence platforms through the destination catalog, enabling data activation across the broader marketing and product technology stack.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Core Analytics APIs:**
- **HTTP V2 API**: Primary event ingestion endpoint with batching and retry logic
- **Identify API**: User property management with append() and set() methods
- **User Privacy API**: GDPR/CCPA compliance and data deletion workflows
- **Dashboard REST API**: Programmatic access to chart results and analytics data

**Experimentation APIs:**
- **Management API**: Programmatic experiment and permission management
- **Analytics REST API v2.0**: Exposure tracking and event ingestion for experiments
- **Edge Evaluation**: Node.js server-side implementation for local evaluation

**SDK Implementation Patterns:**
```javascript
// Analytics initialization
amplitude.init('API_KEY', 'user@example.com', options)
amplitude.track('Event Name', properties, options)

// Experiment initialization  
const experiment = Experiment.initialize('DEPLOYMENT_KEY', config)
const variants = await experiment.fetch(user)

// Ampli code generation
ampli.load({ client: { apiKey: 'API_KEY' }})
ampli.eventName(properties)
```

**CLI Tools:**
```bash
ampli pull [--path ./src/ampli]  # Generate typed tracking APIs
ampli status                     # Verify tracking plan synchronization
```

The platform maintains comprehensive chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Personas, Journeys, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, Stickiness, Lifecycle, Compass, Data Tables, and Revenue LTV, each serving specific analytical use cases within the broader user behavior analysis framework.

Amplitude's architecture enables organizations to implement complete behavioral analytics and experimentation workflows, from initial event tracking through sophisticated statistical analysis and data activation, supporting data-driven decision making across product development, marketing, and business strategy initiatives.
