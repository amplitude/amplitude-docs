## Key Nomenclature and Concepts

### Analytics Terminology
- **Events**: User actions tracked in the system
- **Properties**: Attributes associated with events or users
- **Cohorts**: Groups of users who share common behaviors or characteristics
- **Sessions**: Periods of continuous user activity
- **Funnels**: Sequential series of events representing a user journey
- **Retention**: Measurement of continued user engagement over time

### Experimentation Terminology
- **Experiments**: Controlled tests to evaluate feature performance
- **Variants**: Different versions being tested
- **Metrics**: Measurements used to evaluate experiment outcomes
- **Statistical Significance**: Confidence in experiment results
- **Feature Flags**: Toggles for enabling/disabling features

## Technical Implementation

### SDK Implementation Patterns
```javascript
// Browser SDK example
amplitude.getInstance().logEvent("Button Clicked", {
  buttonColor: "blue",
  buttonPosition: "top"
});
```

### API Endpoints
- Analytics API: `https://amplitude.com/api/2/events`
- Experiment API: `https://experiment.amplitude.com/api/1/variants`

### Collection Configuration
Collections are organized with specific routing patterns that reflect the product structure:
- Analytics charts: `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/{slug}`
- SDKs: `/sdks/{platform}/{slug}`
- APIs: `/apis/{product}/{slug}`
- Experiment: `/feature-experiment/{section}/{slug}`

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's products are designed to work together seamlessly:

1. **Data Collection**: SDKs and APIs feed data into the Amplitude platform
2. **Data Processing**: Raw event data is processed and organized
3. **Analysis**: Analytics tools provide insights from the processed data
4. **Experimentation**: Findings drive hypotheses that can be tested with Experiment
5. **Optimization**: Experiment results inform product improvements

The platform also integrates with external tools through the destination catalog, allowing data to flow to other systems in the customer's tech stack, including warehouse-native integrations for direct data loading via cloud storage solutions like S3 or GCS.
