## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Analytics Terminology:**
- **Events**: User actions tracked within applications (clicks, page views, purchases)
- **Properties**: Metadata associated with events and users for segmentation
- **Cohorts**: User segments based on behavioral patterns or characteristics
- **Funnels**: Sequential user journey analysis showing conversion rates
- **Retention**: User return behavior analysis over time periods
- **Lifecycle**: User engagement state classification (New, Current, Resurrected, Dormant)
- **Stickiness**: Frequency of user engagement within time periods
- **LTV**: Lifetime Value calculation for revenue-generating users

**Experimentation Terminology:**
- **Feature Flags**: Boolean toggles controlling feature availability
- **Variants**: Different versions of features being tested
- **Allocation**: Percentage of users exposed to experiments
- **Statistical Significance**: Confidence level in experiment results
- **Lift**: Percentage improvement in key metrics from experiments
- **Holdout Groups**: Control populations not exposed to features

**Data Management Terminology:**
- **Sources**: Data ingestion points from applications and third-party tools
- **Destinations**: Data activation endpoints for marketing and analytics tools
- **Transformations**: Data processing rules applied during ingestion
- **Schema**: Data structure definitions for events and properties
- **Governance**: Data quality, privacy, and compliance management

**Technical Implementation:**
- **SDK**: Software Development Kit for platform integration
- **API**: Application Programming Interface for programmatic access
