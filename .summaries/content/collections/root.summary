# Amplitude Documentation Platform

## Product Overview

The Amplitude Documentation Platform is a comprehensive content management system for Amplitude's product documentation, covering analytics, experimentation, data management, and developer tools. The platform organizes documentation into collections that represent different product areas, features, and technical resources. It supports multiple content types including product guides, API references, SDK documentation, troubleshooting guides, and educational materials.

Key features include:
- Structured content organization through specialized collections
- Multi-product documentation (Analytics, Experiment, Data, Session Replay)
- SDK documentation for multiple platforms and languages
- API reference documentation
- Chart-specific guidance for analytics visualization
- Educational resources and implementation guides
- Multilingual support (primarily English with Japanese translations)
- Administrative and account management documentation

## Product Relationships and Structure

The documentation is organized into several major product areas:

1. **Analytics Platform**:
   - Core analytics features (`analytics.yaml`)
   - Chart types (event-segmentation, funnel-analysis, retention-analysis, etc.)
   - Data visualization tools (compass, data-tables)
   - User behavior analysis (user-sessions, journeys, lifecycle)

2. **Experiment Platform**:
   - Core experimentation features (`experiment.yaml`)
   - Implementation guides (`experiment-sdks.yaml`)
   - API documentation (`experiment-apis.yaml`)
   - Theoretical foundations (`experiment-theory.yaml`)
   - Advanced topics (`under-the-hood.yaml`, `workflow.yaml`)
   - Troubleshooting (`experiment_troubleshooting.yaml`)

3. **Data Management**:
   - Data sources (`sources.yaml`, `source-catalog.yaml`)
   - Data destinations (`destination-catalog.yaml`)
   - Audiences management (`audiences.yaml`)
   - PII handling (`pii_integrations.yaml`)
   - CDP functionality (`cdp.yaml`)

4. **Developer Resources**:
   - SDK documentation for multiple platforms:
     - Browser (`browser_sdk.yaml`)
     - iOS (`ios_sdk.yaml`)
     - Android (`android_sdk.yaml`)
     - React Native (`react_native_sdk.yaml`)
     - Node.js (`node_js_sdk.yaml`)
     - Python (`python_sdk.yaml`)
     - Java (`java_sdk.yaml`)
     - Go (`go_sdk.yaml`)
     - Unity (`unity_sdk.yaml`)
     - Unreal (`unreal_sdk.yaml`)
     - Flutter (`flutter_sdk.yaml`)
   - Ampli toolkit (`ampli.yaml`)
   - API documentation (`api.yaml`, `apis.yaml`)
   - Instrumentation guides (`instrumentation.yaml`)

5. **Additional Products**:
   - Session Replay (`session-replay.yaml`)
   - Guides and Surveys (`guides_and_surveys.yaml`, `guides_and_surveys_api.yaml`)

6. **Administrative Content**:
   - Account management (`account-management.yaml`)
   - Billing information (`billing-use.yaml`)
   - Single sign-on (`single-sign-on.yaml`)

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Collections**: Content groupings that organize documentation by product area, feature, or content type.

2. **Mount Points**: References to specific entry points that serve as the root for a collection's content structure.

3. **Routes**: URL patterns that define how content is accessed, typically following patterns like:
   - `/analytics/{slug}` for analytics documentation
   - `/feature-experiment/{slug}` for experiment documentation
   - `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/{slug}` for SDK documentation
   - `/apis/{product}/{slug}` for API documentation
   - `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/{slug}` for chart-specific documentation

4. **Date Behavior**: Rules that determine content visibility based on publication dates:
   ```yaml
   date_behavior:
     past: public
     future: private
   ```

5. **Preview Targets**: Configuration for content preview functionality:
   ```yaml
   preview_targets:
     - label: Entry
       url: '{permalink}'
       refresh: true
   ```

6. **Nav Title Injection**: Custom navigation labels applied to content sections:
   ```yaml
   inject:
     nav_title: analytics
   ```

7. **Structure Root**: Boolean setting that determines if a collection appears at the root level of navigation.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The documentation platform integrates with Amplitude's broader product ecosystem:

1. **Analytics Integration**: Documentation for analytics features, charts, and visualization tools that support data analysis workflows.

2. **Experiment Integration**: Documentation for A/B testing, feature flags, and experimentation capabilities, with specialized sections for implementation, theory, and troubleshooting.

3. **Data Platform Integration**: Documentation for data sources, destinations, and management tools that form the foundation of Amplitude's data infrastructure.

4. **Developer Tools Integration**: Comprehensive SDK documentation across multiple platforms and languages, supporting implementation across web, mobile, and server environments.

5. **Cross-Product Features**: Documentation for features that span multiple products, such as account management, billing, and single sign-on.

## Technical Implementation

The documentation platform is built on a content management system with the following technical characteristics:

1. **Content Structure**: YAML configuration files define collection properties:
   ```yaml
   title: 'Analytics'
   template: default
   layout: layout
   revisions: false
   route: '/analytics/{slug}'
   sort_dir: asc
   ```

2. **Multilingual Support**: Site-specific configuration for language variants:
   ```yaml
   sites:
     - en
     - jp
   propagate: false
   ```

3. **Content Organization**: Collections are organized by product area, with specialized routing patterns for different content types:
   - Product documentation: `/[product]/{slug}`
   - SDK documentation: `/sdks/[product]/[platform]/{slug}`
   - API documentation: `/apis/[product]/{slug}`
   - Chart documentation: `/analytics/charts/[chart-type]/{slug}`

4. **Navigation Structure**: Content is organized hierarchically with navigation titles injected through configuration:
   ```yaml
   inject:
     nav_title: analytics
     blade: Amplitude Analytics
   ```

5. **Preview Functionality**: Content can be previewed using permalink-based URLs:
   ```yaml
   preview_targets:
     - label: Entry
       url: '{permalink}'
       refresh: true
   ```

The documentation platform serves as a comprehensive knowledge base for Amplitude's products, providing structured access to implementation guides, API references, and educational resources for users across different roles and technical backgrounds.
