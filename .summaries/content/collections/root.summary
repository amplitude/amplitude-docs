Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools for product analytics, feature experimentation, customer data management, and user engagement. The platform serves as an integrated ecosystem for understanding user behavior, optimizing product experiences, and driving growth through data-driven decision making.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform is built around several interconnected products that work together to provide end-to-end analytics and optimization capabilities:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, providing event tracking, user behavior analysis, and comprehensive reporting through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Revenue LTV, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Impact Analysis, and Engagement Matrix. The analytics platform also includes Legacy Charts for backward compatibility and Other Charts for specialized use cases.

**Amplitude Experiment** is the feature flagging and A/B testing platform that enables teams to run controlled experiments, manage feature rollouts, and optimize user experiences. It includes advanced techniques, experiment theory, workflow management, troubleshooting capabilities, and comprehensive result analysis through dedicated experiment results charts.

**Amplitude Session Replay** provides visual insights into user interactions by recording and replaying user sessions, enabling teams to understand user behavior beyond traditional analytics metrics.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** is an in-product engagement platform that delivers contextual user experiences, onboarding flows, feedback collection, and help resources directly within applications.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and distribution across the entire customer data ecosystem, including audience management, source and destination catalogs, and warehouse-native capabilities.

## SDK and Integration Ecosystem

The platform provides comprehensive instrumentation capabilities through multiple SDKs and integration points:

**Analytics SDKs** support all major platforms including Browser SDK, Android SDK, iOS SDK, React Native SDK, Flutter SDK, Unity SDK, Unreal SDK, Node.js SDK, Python SDK, Java SDK, and Go SDK. Each SDK provides platform-specific optimizations and features while maintaining consistent event tracking and user identification capabilities.

**Experiment SDKs** enable feature flag evaluation and experiment participation across the same range of platforms, ensuring consistent experimentation capabilities regardless of the technology stack.

**Ampli** is a type-safe analytics wrapper that provides strongly-typed event tracking, reducing implementation errors and ensuring data quality across development teams.

## API Infrastructure

The platform exposes comprehensive API capabilities through multiple specialized endpoints:

**Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/`) provides programmatic access to event data, user properties, and analytics results, enabling custom integrations and data exports.

**Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) support feature flag management, experiment configuration, and result retrieval for automated experimentation workflows.

**Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) enables programmatic management of in-product experiences and survey data collection.

## Data Management and Integration

The CDP capabilities include extensive **Source Catalog** and **Destination Catalog** integrations, supporting hundreds of third-party tools and platforms. The platform manages data flow through configurable sources that collect data from various touchpoints and destinations that distribute insights and audiences to marketing, analytics, and operational tools.

**Audiences** functionality enables dynamic user segmentation based on behavioral data, allowing teams to create and maintain user cohorts that automatically update based on real-time user actions and properties.

**PII Integrations** provide specialized handling of personally identifiable information, ensuring compliance with privacy regulations while maintaining analytics capabilities.

**Warehouse-native Amplitude** enables organizations to run Amplitude analytics directly on their existing data warehouse infrastructure, providing flexibility for enterprise data architectures.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

The platform includes comprehensive **Account Management** capabilities covering user permissions, organization settings, and access controls. **Single Sign-on** integration supports enterprise authentication systems, while **Billing and Use** management provides visibility into platform usage and costs.

**Migration** tools and documentation support transitions from other analytics platforms, ensuring smooth onboarding for organizations switching to Amplitude.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** are discrete user actions tracked within applications, forming the foundation of all analytics and experimentation.

**User Properties** are attributes associated with individual users that persist across sessions and enable segmentation and personalization.

**Cohorts/Audiences** are dynamic groups of users defined by shared characteristics or behaviors.

**Feature Flags** are configuration switches that control feature availability and behavior without requiring code deployments.

**Experiments** are controlled tests that compare different user experiences to measure impact on key metrics.

**Funnels** represent sequential user journeys through defined steps, typically used to analyze conversion processes.

**Retention** measures user return behavior over specified time periods.

**Lifecycle** categorizes users based on their engagement patterns (new, current, dormant, resurrected).

**Stickiness** measures how frequently users engage with a product within a given time period.

**Journeys** map the paths users take through an application or website.

## Broader Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates with the broader digital product ecosystem through **Partners** integrations, supporting connections with marketing automation platforms, customer support tools, product management software, and business intelligence systems. The platform serves as a central hub for product intelligence, feeding insights into decision-making processes across product, engineering, marketing, and executive teams.

The **Academy Content** and educational resources support user onboarding and skill development, while comprehensive **FAQ and Troubleshooting** documentation ensures successful implementation and ongoing usage.

**Japanese Translation** support indicates global reach and localization capabilities for international organizations.

The platform's architecture supports both self-service analytics for individual contributors and enterprise-grade governance for large organizations, making it suitable for companies ranging from startups to Fortune 500 enterprises seeking to build data-driven product experiences.
