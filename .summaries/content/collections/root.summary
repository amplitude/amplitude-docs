Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, optimize experiences, and drive product growth through data-driven insights.

## Core Product Suite

The platform consists of four primary products that work together to provide end-to-end analytics and optimization capabilities:

**Analytics** serves as the foundational product for behavioral analytics, enabling teams to track, measure, and analyze user interactions across digital properties. This product focuses on understanding user journeys, conversion funnels, and engagement patterns through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Compass, Data Tables, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, Lifecycle, Personas, Revenue LTV, Stickiness, and Experiment Results.

**Data** functions as the integration hub, connecting Amplitude with existing tech stacks and data infrastructure. This includes Sources, Audiences, warehouse-native capabilities, and comprehensive source and destination catalogs with integration categories. The Data product facilitates seamless data flow between Amplitude and other business systems, ensuring comprehensive data collection and distribution.

**Experiment** provides A/B testing and feature flag capabilities, allowing teams to test hypotheses, validate product changes, and optimize user experiences through controlled experimentation and gradual feature rollouts. This includes advanced techniques, experiment theory, workflow management, troubleshooting, and under-the-hood technical details.

**Session Replay** offers digital experience reconstruction by capturing and replaying user sessions, providing visual context to quantitative analytics data and helping teams understand the "why" behind user behaviors.

## Technical Implementation Architecture

Amplitude's technical implementation centers around comprehensive SDK coverage and robust API infrastructure:

### SDK Ecosystem
The platform provides extensive SDK support across multiple platforms:
- **Web/Browser**: Browser SDK with session replay integration
- **Mobile**: Android SDK, iOS SDK, React Native SDK, Flutter SDK
- **Gaming**: Unity SDK, Unreal SDK  
- **Server-side**: Node.js SDK, Python SDK, Java SDK, Go SDK
- **Code Generation**: Ampli for type-safe analytics implementation
- **Framework Integrations**: Dedicated integrations for popular development frameworks

### API Infrastructure
Multiple API endpoints serve different product areas:
- **Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/`) for data querying and management
- **Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) for feature flag and A/B test management
- **Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) for in-app messaging

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Collections Structure**: The documentation is organized into collections representing different product areas, each with specific routing patterns (e.g., `/analytics/charts/{slug}`, `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/{slug}`, `/feature-experiment/{slug}`).

**Navigation Taxonomy**: Content is categorized using `nav_title` injection for consistent navigation grouping (analytics, data, experiment, apis, analytics_sdks, experiment_sdks, etc.).

**Mount Points**: Many collections use mount identifiers for content management, indicating structured content relationships and hierarchical organization.

**Site Localization**: Multi-site support with English (`en`) as primary and Japanese (`jp`) translation capabilities.

**Blade System**: Product-specific branding through blade injection (e.g., "Amplitude Experiment", "Amplitude Session Replay", "Amplitude Guides and Surveys").

**Content Propagation**: Site-specific content distribution controlled through propagate flags and site arrays.

## Ecosystem Integration and Content Organization

The platform documentation reflects a comprehensive ecosystem approach:

### Administrative and Enterprise Features
- **Account Management** (`/admin/account-management/`)
- **Single Sign-on** (`/admin/single-sign-on/`)
- **Billing and Use** (`/admin/billing-use/`)

### Developer Resources
- **Get Started** section for onboarding
- **Migration** guidance for platform transitions
- **Instrumentation** best practices
- **FAQ and Troubleshooting** for common issues

### Partner and Integration Ecosystem
- **Partners** section for third-party integrations
- **Destination Catalog** and **Source Catalog** with integration categories
- **PII Integrations** for privacy-compliant data handling

### Educational Content
- **Academy Content** for learning resources
- **Guides and Surveys** for user engagement strategies

The routing structure reveals API endpoints like `/apis/{product}/{slug}` and SDK documentation at `/sdks/{product}/{platform}/{slug}`, indicating a well-organized developer experience. The presence of preview targets, date-based content behavior, and structured navigation suggests a mature documentation platform designed for both technical implementers and business users across the analytics and experimentation lifecycle.
