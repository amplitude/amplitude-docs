## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Analytics Terminology
- **Event**: A discrete user action tracked in Amplitude (e.g., page view, button click)
- **User Properties**: Attributes associated with users that persist across sessions
- **Event Properties**: Contextual information about specific events
- **Cohort**: A group of users who share common characteristics or behaviors
- **Session**: A period of continuous user activity, typically defined by timeout thresholds
- **MTU (Monthly Tracked Users)**: Unique users who trigger events within a calendar month (used for billing)

### Data Collection Terms
- **Device ID**: Unique identifier for a device or browser
- **User ID**: Custom identifier for a logged-in user
- **Amplitude ID**: System-generated identifier that manages the relationship between Device IDs and User IDs
- **Tracking Plan**: Schema defining expected events and properties
- **Ampli Wrapper**: Generated code that provides type-safe event tracking

### Experimentation Concepts
- **Feature Flag**: Toggle that controls feature visibility
- **Variant**: Specific version of a feature being tested
- **Bucketing**: Process of assigning users to experiment variants
- **Exposure Event**: Tracks when a user encounters an experiment variant
- **Statistical Significance**: Confidence that observed differences aren't due to chance

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's products are designed to work together in an integrated workflow:

1. **Data Collection**: Events are captured through SDKs, APIs, or integrations
2. **Analysis**: User behavior is analyzed through specialized charts and visualizations
3. **Segmentation**: Users are grouped into cohorts based on behavior patterns
4. **Experimentation**: Hypotheses are tested through controlled experiments
5. **Activation**: Insights are activated through integrations with marketing and engagement platforms

The platform supports integration with numerous third-party tools through:
- **Data Sources**: Import data from platforms like Segment, Rudderstack, and custom sources
- **Destination Catalog**: Export data to tools like Snowflake, BigQuery, and marketing platforms
- **Partner Integrations**: Connect with tools like Slack, Jira, Miro, and Atlassian products

## API and Implementation Details

### Key API Endpoints
- **HTTP API V2**: `/2/httpapi` for sending events
- **Identify API**: `/identify` for updating user properties
- **Batch API**: For sending multiple events in a single request
- **Export API**: For retrieving raw event data
- **Experiment Evaluation API**: For retrieving experiment variants

### SDK Implementation
Amplitude provides SDKs for various platforms:
```javascript
// Browser SDK example
import * as amplitude from '@amplitude/analytics-browser';

amplitude.init('API_KEY', {
  defaultTracking: {
    sessions: true,
    pageViews: true,
    formInteractions: true,
    fileDownloads: true
  }
});

amplitude.track('Button Clicked', {
  buttonColor: 'blue',
  buttonText: 'Submit'
});
```

### Ampli Implementation
```javascript
// Initialize Ampli
ampli.load({
  client: {
    apiKey: 'API_KEY'
  }
});

// Track strongly-typed event
ampli.trackEvent('ProductPurchased', {
  productId: '123',
  price: 99.99,
  quantity: 1
});
```

Amplitude offers different plan tiers (Starter, Growth, Enterprise) with varying features, data volume limits, and support options. The platform is designed to scale from small startups to enterprise organizations, with specialized tools for product teams, marketers, data analysts, and developers.
