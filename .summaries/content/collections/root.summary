Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment (feature flagging and A/B testing), Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Product Architecture and Core Components

### Analytics Platform
The Analytics core provides event tracking, user segmentation, and behavioral analysis through multiple chart types and visualization tools. Key components include:

**Chart Types**: Event Segmentation for basic metrics, Funnel Analysis for conversion tracking, Retention Analysis for user engagement, Cohort Analysis through Lifecycle charts, User Journey mapping via Journeys, Revenue LTV for monetization analysis, and specialized charts like Compass (KPI monitoring), Stickiness, Impact Analysis, and Engagement Matrix.

**Data Infrastructure**: The platform supports multiple data ingestion methods through Analytics SDKs (Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, Unreal), server-side APIs, and third-party integrations via Source Catalog and Destination Catalog.

### Experimentation Platform (Amplitude Experiment)
A comprehensive A/B testing and feature flagging solution with components for:
- **Experiment Design**: Statistical experiment setup with proper randomization and power analysis
- **Feature Management**: Flag-based feature rollouts with targeting and gradual releases  
- **Results Analysis**: Statistical significance testing and impact measurement
- **Advanced Techniques**: Multi-armed bandits, sequential testing, and advanced statistical methods

### Customer Data Platform (CDP)
Provides unified customer profiles and data orchestration through:
- **Audiences**: Dynamic user segmentation based on behavioral and demographic criteria
- **Data Sources**: Unified ingestion from multiple touchpoints
- **Destinations**: Activation of audience segments across marketing and product tools
- **Warehouse-native Architecture**: Direct integration with cloud data warehouses

### Additional Products
- **Session Replay**: User session recording and analysis for UX optimization
- **Guides and Surveys**: In-product messaging and user feedback collection
- **Agents**: AI-powered analytics assistance and insights generation

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Core Analytics Concepts
- **Events**: Discrete user actions tracked with properties and timestamps
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes associated with individual users
- **Event Properties**: Contextual data specific to individual event occurrences
- **Cohorts/Audiences**: Dynamic user segments based on behavioral or demographic criteria
- **Funnels**: Sequential event flows measuring conversion rates
- **Retention**: User return behavior over specified time periods
- **LTV (Lifetime Value)**: Revenue attribution and customer value calculation

### Experimentation Terminology
- **Feature Flags**: Boolean toggles controlling feature availability
- **Variants**: Different versions of features being tested
- **Allocation**: Percentage of users exposed to experiments
- **Statistical Significance**: Confidence level in experiment results
- **Lift**: Percentage improvement in key metrics

### Data Management
- **Tracking Plan**: Schema definition for events and properties via Amplitude Data
- **Taxonomy**: Standardized naming conventions for events and properties
- **Governance**: Data quality controls and validation rules
- **Instrumentation**: Code implementation for event tracking

### Technical Infrastructure
- **SDKs (Software Development Kits)**: Client libraries for event tracking
- **APIs**: Server-to-server integration endpoints
- **Ampli**: Code generation tool for type-safe event tracking
- **Server Zones**: Data residency options (US/EU)
- **Real-time vs Batch**: Event processing and delivery modes

## API Endpoints and Integration Methods

### Analytics APIs
- **HTTP V2 API**: Modern event ingestion endpoint (`/2/httpapi`) for real-time event tracking
- **Batch API**: Bulk event upload for historical data import
- **Export API**: Raw event data extraction with S3/GCS integration
- **Dashboard REST API**: Programmatic access to chart data and configurations
- **Cohort API**: Audience definition and membership management

### Experiment APIs
- **Evaluation API**: Real-time feature flag and experiment variant resolution
- **Management API**: Experiment configuration and flag management
- **Results API**: Statistical results and performance metrics access

### SDK Integration Patterns
- **Client-side SDKs**: `amplitude.init()`, `amplitude.track()`, `amplitude.identify()`
- **Server-side SDKs**: Similar patterns with additional configuration for API keys and batching
- **Ampli Generated Code**: `ampli.load()`, `ampli.track.eventName()`, `ampli.identify()`

### Common CLI Commands
- **Ampli Workflow**: `ampli pull` (download tracking plan), `ampli status` (validate implementation)
- **SDK Installation**: `npm install @amplitude/analytics-browser` or platform-specific package managers

## Ecosystem Integration and Relationships

### Data Flow Architecture
The platform follows a hub-and-spoke model where Analytics serves as the central data repository, feeding insights to Experiment for targeting and results analysis, Session Replay for behavioral context, and CDP for audience activation. Events flow from multiple sources through standardized SDKs and APIs into the Analytics core, where they're processed for real-time dashboards and batch analysis.

### Cross-Product Integration
- **Analytics + Experiment**: Experiment results appear as specialized chart types, with Analytics events used for experiment assignment and outcome measurement
- **Analytics + CDP**: Behavioral data powers audience segmentation, while audiences enable targeted analysis
- **Session Replay + Analytics**: Session recordings provide qualitative context for quantitative metrics
- **Guides and Surveys + Analytics**: In-product messaging campaigns tracked as events with response analysis

### Third-Party Ecosystem
The platform integrates with marketing tools (Google Ads, Facebook, Salesforce), data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift), and development workflows through comprehensive source and destination catalogs. Warehouse-native capabilities allow direct SQL querying of Amplitude data within existing data infrastructure.

### Administrative and Governance
Organization-level features include Single Sign-On (SSO) integration, role-based access control, billing management, account administration, and data governance tools. The platform supports enterprise requirements through SOC 2 compliance, GDPR controls, and configurable data retention policies.

The documentation structure reflects this integrated approach, with clear migration paths between legacy and modern implementations, comprehensive troubleshooting resources, and specialized content for different user personas (developers, analysts, product managers, administrators).
