Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides product teams with tools to understand user behavior, optimize experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of several interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP), all unified through a common data foundation and extensive SDK ecosystem.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

**Core Analytics Platform** serves as the foundation, offering multiple chart types for behavioral analysis: Event Segmentation for user action analysis, Funnel Analysis for conversion tracking, Retention Analysis for user stickiness measurement, User Sessions for engagement patterns, Journeys for path analysis, Lifecycle for user state transitions, Personas for behavioral clustering, Compass for metric monitoring, Impact Analysis for feature assessment, Revenue LTV for monetization tracking, Engagement Matrix for activity correlation, Stickiness for usage frequency, and Data Tables for raw data exploration.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced statistical methods, experiment theory documentation, and comprehensive results analysis. The platform includes specialized collections for advanced techniques, troubleshooting, and theoretical foundations, with dedicated experiment result charts integrated into the analytics suite.

**Session Replay** captures and analyzes user interactions through recorded sessions, providing qualitative insights to complement quantitative analytics data.

**Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user engagement through contextual messaging, onboarding flows, and feedback collection mechanisms.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation through source and destination catalogs, audience management, and warehouse-native capabilities. The platform includes PII handling integrations and comprehensive data governance tools.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Collections** represent distinct product areas or feature sets within the documentation structure, each with specific routing patterns and navigation contexts.

**Mount Points** (identified by UUIDs like `ba956cb4-9ae1-456a-b122-984b491048f6`) establish hierarchical relationships between collections, enabling nested content organization.

**Navigation Contexts** (`nav_title` injections) include: `analytics` for core analytics features, `experiment` for A/B testing, `data` for CDP functionality, `apis` for developer resources, `analytics_sdks`/`experiment_sdks` for instrumentation, `admin` for account management, `get_started` for onboarding, and specialized contexts like `charts`, `session_replay`, and `guides_and_surveys`.

**Blade Designations** specify product branding contexts, particularly "Amplitude Experiment", "Amplitude Session Replay", and "Amplitude Guides and Surveys" for distinct product experiences.

**Route Patterns** define URL structures with dynamic segments like `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/{slug}`, `/sdks/{product}/{platform}/{slug}`, `/apis/{product}/{slug}`, and `/feature-experiment/{category}/{slug}`.

**Sites and Propagation** control multi-language support, with English (`en`) as primary and Japanese (`jp`) for localized content, using propagation flags for content distribution.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The platform operates through a unified SDK ecosystem supporting multiple platforms and programming languages. **Analytics SDKs** include Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal implementations, all following consistent instrumentation patterns. **Experiment SDKs** provide feature flagging capabilities across the same platform matrix. **Ampli** serves as a type-safe wrapper for analytics implementation, ensuring data quality and consistency.

**API Infrastructure** encompasses Analytics APIs for data ingestion and querying, Experiment APIs for flag management and assignment, and Guides and Surveys APIs for experience delivery. The platform integrates with external systems through comprehensive source and destination catalogs, supporting data warehouse connections, marketing automation platforms, and business intelligence tools.

**Administrative Systems** include account management, billing and usage tracking, single sign-on integration, and granular permission controls. The platform supports enterprise deployment patterns with proxy configurations, custom domains, and advanced security features.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Analytics API Endpoints** follow patterns like `/apis/analytics/{endpoint}` for event ingestion, query execution, and data export functionality.

**Experiment API Endpoints** use `/apis/experiment/{endpoint}` for flag configuration, user assignment, and result tracking.

**SDK Initialization Patterns** vary by platform but generally include:
- Web: `amplitude.init(apiKey, options)` and `amplitude.track(eventName, properties)`
- Mobile: Platform-specific initialization with API key configuration and automatic session tracking
- Server-side: HTTP client initialization with batch processing capabilities

**Route Structures** demonstrate clear hierarchical organization:
- `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/{slug}` for specific chart documentation
- `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/{slug}` for platform-specific SDK guides
- `/feature-experiment/{category}/{slug}` for experimentation features
- `/data/{category}/{slug}` for CDP functionality
- `/admin/{category}/{slug}` for administrative features

**Multi-language Support** operates through site-specific collections with Japanese translations following the pattern `/{slug}` for localized content, while English content uses category-specific routing.

The platform includes specialized troubleshooting collections, FAQ resources, migration guides, and partner integration documentation, all organized within the same collection-based architecture that enables consistent navigation, preview functionality, and content management across the entire product suite.
