Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools for understanding user behavior, conducting A/B tests, and managing feature rollouts. The platform consists of several interconnected products that work together to provide end-to-end analytics and experimentation capabilities.

## Core Product Suite

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics platform, offering event tracking, user segmentation, and behavioral analysis through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, Cohort Analysis, and User Journey mapping. The analytics engine supports real-time data processing and provides insights into user engagement patterns, conversion funnels, and product performance metrics.

**Amplitude Experiment** is the feature flagging and A/B testing platform that enables controlled feature rollouts and statistical experimentation. It supports both remote and local evaluation modes, with comprehensive SDK coverage across client-side and server-side implementations. The platform integrates natively with Analytics for automatic exposure tracking and statistical analysis.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and reconstructs user sessions to provide visual insights into user interactions and identify friction points in the user experience.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product messaging, user onboarding flows, and feedback collection through targeted surveys and contextual guides.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** functionality provides data ingestion, transformation, and routing capabilities through source and destination catalogs, enabling organizations to centralize their customer data and distribute it across their technology stack.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The platform follows a hub-and-spoke architecture with Analytics at the center. Data flows from various sources through the CDP into Analytics, where it's processed and made available for segmentation, analysis, and audience creation. These audiences and insights then feed into Experiment for targeted feature rollouts and A/B testing.

The **Ampli** code generation tool creates type-safe tracking libraries that ensure consistent event instrumentation across the organization, bridging the gap between product requirements and technical implementation.

**Agents** provide automated insights and anomaly detection, surfacing important trends and changes in user behavior without manual analysis.

Multi-site support enables content localization, with dedicated Japanese translation capabilities and region-specific data residency options including EU data centers for GDPR compliance.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** are discrete user actions tracked within applications, forming the foundation of all analytics and experimentation analysis.

**Properties** are attributes associated with events or users that enable segmentation and targeting.

**Cohorts** are dynamic user segments based on behavioral criteria that can be used across Analytics, Experiment, and other platform features.

**Variants** in experimentation represent different experiences users can receive, containing configuration data and feature flags.

**Deployment Keys** authenticate SDK implementations and determine which project environment and feature flags are accessible.

**Exposure Tracking** automatically logs when users encounter experiment variants, enabling accurate statistical analysis.

**Flag Configurations** define targeting rules, allocation percentages, and variant assignments for feature flags.

**Taxonomies** provide organizational structure for integrations and content, particularly visible in source and destination catalogs.

## Technical Implementation

The platform provides extensive SDK coverage across programming languages and platforms:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, and specialized implementations for various frameworks.

**Experiment SDKs** mirror this coverage with both client-side and server-side implementations, supporting remote evaluation (server-computed assignments) and local evaluation (client-side flag processing with real-time streaming).

**API Coverage** includes Analytics APIs for event ingestion and querying, Experiment APIs for flag management and evaluation, and Guides and Surveys APIs for in-product messaging control.

Common SDK patterns include:
- `initialize()` methods with Amplitude Analytics integration
- `track()` for event logging with automatic user context
- `fetch()` and `evaluate()` for experiment variant retrieval
- `start()` for local evaluation with flag streaming
- Automatic exposure tracking with 24-hour deduplication

## Integration Ecosystem

The platform integrates extensively with third-party tools through:

**Source Catalog** - ingesting data from marketing tools, customer support platforms, payment processors, and other business applications

**Destination Catalog** - routing processed data and audiences to advertising platforms, email marketing tools, data warehouses, and business intelligence systems

**Partner Integrations** - certified integrations with major technology vendors and consulting partners

**Warehouse-native Amplitude** - direct integration with cloud data warehouses for organizations preferring to keep raw data in their own infrastructure

Administrative features include comprehensive account management, billing and usage monitoring, single sign-on integration, and role-based access controls. The platform supports enterprise requirements with audit logging, data governance controls, and compliance features for regulated industries.

The documentation structure reflects a user journey from initial setup through advanced implementation, with dedicated sections for troubleshooting, migration guidance, and theoretical foundations of experimentation methodology.
