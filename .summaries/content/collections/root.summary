Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that provides behavioral analytics, customer data management, feature experimentation, and user session analysis capabilities. The platform serves as an integrated ecosystem for product teams to understand user behavior, optimize experiences, and make data-driven decisions across web, mobile, and server-side applications.

## Core Product Architecture

The Amplitude ecosystem consists of four primary products that work together to deliver end-to-end product intelligence:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational behavioral analytics platform, offering specialized analysis tools including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Personas, Revenue LTV, Impact Analysis, Stickiness metrics, Engagement Matrix, and Compass analytics. The platform features AI-powered automation for product growth analysis and supports both real-time and historical behavioral data analysis.

**Amplitude Data** functions as the customer data platform (CDP) and data management layer, providing tech stack integration, cross-device identity resolution, data quality improvement, audience discovery, and warehouse-native analytics capabilities. It includes comprehensive source and destination catalogs for data connectivity and bidirectional data flow with external systems.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities, supporting multivariate experiments, Multi-armed Bandit optimization, advanced targeting techniques, and experiment theory implementation. The platform includes specialized tools for experiment results analysis and troubleshooting.

**Amplitude Session Replay** provides comprehensive user behavior visualization through session recordings, heatmaps (click maps, selector maps, scroll maps), and behavioral analytics across web, mobile, and React Native applications.

## Product Relationships and Integration Framework

The products operate as an interconnected ecosystem where data flows seamlessly between components. Analytics serves as the central hub collecting behavioral data that feeds into Experiment for hypothesis testing and Session Replay for detailed interaction analysis. The Data product orchestrates data quality, integration, and warehouse connectivity while enabling audience creation and cross-platform identity resolution.

Session Replay integrates through multiple implementation strategies including plugin architecture extending core Amplitude SDKs, middleware integration for legacy implementations, standalone SDKs for third-party analytics users, and specialized connectors for Segment, Rudderstack, and Google Tag Manager ecosystems.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** represent discrete user actions or system occurrences that form the fundamental data units for analytics, serving as the basis for funnel analysis, user journey mapping, and conversion tracking.

**Event Properties** and **User Properties** provide contextual attributes for granular segmentation, with event properties describing specific action contexts and user properties persisting across sessions for cohort analysis.

**Session Replay ID** creates unique identifiers linking recorded sessions to analytics events, enabling seamless integration between behavioral data and visual session analysis.

**Feature Flags** are configuration switches enabling controlled feature rollouts and experimentation without code deployments, supporting dynamic product experiences and A/B testing workflows.

**Ampli CLI/Wrapper** provides code-generated SDK systems with static type checking, autocomplete functionality, and structured event tracking based on centrally managed Tracking Plans.

**Cross-device Identity Resolution** connects user behavior across multiple devices and touchpoints, enabling comprehensive user journey analysis and attribution.

**Masking Levels** (Conservative, Light, Medium) control privacy protection tiers in Session Replay, with CSS selector-based overrides and PII compliance capabilities.

## Technical Implementation and API Architecture

The platform provides comprehensive SDK support across multiple categories:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser SDK, Android SDK, iOS SDK, React Native SDK, Flutter SDK, Node.js SDK, Python SDK, Java SDK, Go SDK, and Unity/Unreal SDKs, each supporting extensive configuration options including `flushIntervalMillis`, `flushQueueSize`, `serverZone` (EU/US), `trackingOptions`, and privacy controls.

**API Endpoints** span multiple categories:
- Analytics/Data APIs for programmatic data access and configuration
- Experiment APIs for feature flag and experiment management  
- Guides/Surveys APIs for user engagement content management
- SCIM APIs for enterprise user and group management

**Session Replay Implementation** supports plugin architecture integration, standalone implementations, and third-party wrapper configurations with core methods including `amplitude.add(plugin)`, `sessionReplay.init()`, `getSessionReplayProperties()`, and recording state controls.

## Advanced Features and Enterprise Capabilities

**Privacy and Compliance Framework** includes GDPR compliance infrastructure, Consent Management Platform (CMP) support, three-tier data masking systems, PII handling controls, and comprehensive user consent management with granular opt-out mechanisms.

**Data Management Infrastructure** features warehouse-native architectures, bidirectional data warehouse integration, data quality monitoring, audience synchronization, and comprehensive source/destination catalogs supporting hundreds of integrations.

**Experimentation Suite** provides advanced targeting capabilities, statistical significance testing, Multi-armed Bandit optimization, experiment result analysis tools, and comprehensive troubleshooting frameworks for implementation debugging.

**Administrative Controls** include billing management, account administration, single sign-on integration, partner ecosystem support, role-based access controls, and organizational governance features for enterprise deployments.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude positions itself as a central product intelligence hub integrating with existing technology stacks through its comprehensive data platform. The CDP functionality enables seamless data flow with data warehouses, marketing automation tools, and business intelligence systems. The platform supports both cloud-hosted and warehouse-native deployment architectures.

The modular design allows organizations to implement individual products independently or as an integrated suite, with data flowing seamlessly between Analytics, Data, Experiment, and Session Replay components. This architecture supports various deployment scenarios from basic analytics implementations to comprehensive product intelligence platforms leveraging the full suite for advanced experimentation and user experience optimization.

The platform serves multiple organizational roles including product teams, growth teams, product marketing teams, and data teams, with specialized documentation, training resources (Academy Content), and partner ecosystem support for implementation and optimization guidance.
