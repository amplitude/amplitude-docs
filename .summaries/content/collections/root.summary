Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that provides businesses with behavioral data collection, analysis, and activation capabilities across web, mobile, and server-side applications. The platform consists of four core products: Analytics for behavioral insights, Experiment for feature flagging and A/B testing, Session Replay for user experience analysis, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP) for data management and activation.

## Core Product Architecture

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, offering multiple chart types for behavioral analysis including Event Segmentation for user action analysis, Funnel Analysis for conversion optimization, Retention Analysis for user engagement measurement, and Cohort Analysis through Personas. Advanced visualization tools include Compass for KPI monitoring, Journeys for user path analysis, Impact Analysis for feature impact measurement, and Revenue LTV for monetization insights.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature management and experimentation capabilities with statistical analysis engines, advanced targeting mechanisms, and integration with analytics data for comprehensive experiment measurement. The platform supports both client-side and server-side experimentation with real-time flag evaluation and sophisticated audience targeting.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and reconstructs user sessions for qualitative analysis, enabling teams to understand user behavior patterns and identify friction points in digital experiences.

**Amplitude CDP** manages data collection, transformation, and activation across 100+ third-party integrations, supporting real-time event streaming, cohort syncing, and raw data exports to data warehouses and marketing platforms.

## SDK and Integration Ecosystem

The platform provides comprehensive instrumentation through multiple SDKs including **Browser SDK** for web applications, **Android SDK** and **iOS SDK** for mobile platforms, **React Native SDK** and **Flutter SDK** for cross-platform development, and server-side SDKs for **Node.js**, **Python**, **Java**, and **Go**. Gaming platforms are supported through **Unity SDK** and **Unreal SDK**.

**Ampli** serves as Amplitude's type-safe analytics wrapper, providing code generation and validation for consistent event tracking across development teams. This ensures data quality and reduces implementation errors through compile-time validation.

The **Analytics API** enables programmatic data ingestion through HTTP endpoints including the Batch Event Upload API (`/batch`), Identify API for user property updates, and Group Identify API for account-level properties. The **Experiment APIs** provide flag evaluation endpoints and configuration management for feature flagging implementations.

## Data Management and Activation

**Source Catalog** integrations enable data collection from external platforms including CRM systems, marketing automation tools, and third-party analytics platforms. The catalog supports both real-time streaming and batch data imports with transformation capabilities.

**Destination Catalog** provides data activation through three primary patterns:
- **Cohort Syncing** exports user segments to marketing platforms like Braze, Customer.io, and advertising networks
- **Event Streaming** forwards real-time behavioral data to downstream systems for trigger-based automation
- **Raw Data Exports** deliver bulk data to warehouses including Snowflake, BigQuery, and Redshift

**Audiences** functionality creates dynamic user segments based on behavioral criteria, demographic properties, and computed user attributes. These audiences integrate with both internal analytics workflows and external activation platforms.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** provides organization-level controls including user permissions, project management, and cross-project data governance. **Single Sign-On** integration supports SAML and OAuth providers for enterprise authentication requirements.

**Billing and Use** management tracks data volume consumption, API usage limits, and feature entitlements across different subscription tiers. The platform provides usage analytics and alerting for quota management.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** represent user actions or system occurrences with associated properties and timestamps. **User Properties** store persistent user attributes while **Event Properties** contain action-specific metadata.

**Amplitude ID** serves as the primary user identifier for cross-platform user resolution, while **User ID** represents business-specific user identifiers. **Device ID** tracks anonymous users before identification.

**Cohorts** define user segments based on behavioral or demographic criteria. **Funnels** analyze sequential user actions for conversion measurement. **Retention** measures user return behavior over specified time periods.

**Feature Flags** control feature visibility and behavior, while **Experiments** compare different user experiences through statistical testing. **Variants** represent different experiment treatments or flag configurations.

## Technical Implementation Patterns

The platform operates on event-driven architecture with real-time data processing capabilities. **Server Upload Time** provides consistent event ordering, while **Client Upload Time** captures user-side timestamps for offline scenarios.

**Merge Amplitude ID** functionality resolves user identity across anonymous and identified sessions. **Cross-Platform Tracking** maintains user continuity across web, mobile, and server-side touchpoints.

API endpoints follow RESTful patterns with JSON payloads. Key endpoints include:
- `/batch` for bulk event ingestion
- `/identify` for user property updates  
- `/groupidentify` for account-level properties
- `/v1/flag` for feature flag evaluation
- `/cohort` for audience management

**Rate Limiting** implements 429 status codes with exponential backoff. **Payload Size Limits** restrict requests to 2MB for reliable transmission.

## Advanced Analytics Capabilities

**Data Tables** provide raw event exploration with SQL-like filtering and aggregation. **Engagement Matrix** visualizes user activity patterns across multiple dimensions. **Stickiness** measures feature usage frequency and user engagement depth.

**Lifecycle Analysis** categorizes users into New, Current, Returning, and Dormant segments for engagement optimization. **User Sessions** aggregate events into meaningful user interaction periods.

**Experiment Results** charts integrate with Amplitude Experiment to measure statistical significance, confidence intervals, and business impact metrics for A/B tests and feature releases.

## Integration Architecture

The platform supports **Warehouse-Native** deployments where analytics run directly on customer data warehouses, reducing data movement and enabling real-time analysis on existing data infrastructure.

**Partners** ecosystem includes technology integrations, consulting services, and implementation specialists for enterprise deployments. **PII Integrations** provide privacy-compliant data handling for regulated industries.

**Migration** tools facilitate platform transitions from competitors like Google Analytics, Mixpanel, and Adobe Analytics with data mapping and historical import capabilities.

The documentation supports multiple languages including **Japanese Translation** for international deployments, with localized content and region-specific compliance guidance.
