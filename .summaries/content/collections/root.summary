Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, manage data, conduct experiments, and monitor user sessions. The platform consists of four core products that work together to deliver end-to-end product intelligence capabilities.

## Core Product Suite

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, enabling organizations to track, measure, and analyze user interactions across digital products. It provides behavioral analytics capabilities to understand user journeys and product performance through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Compass, Data Tables, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, Lifecycle, Personas, Stickiness, Revenue LTV, and Experiment Results.

**Amplitude Data** functions as the data management layer, handling data integration, warehousing, and governance. It includes Sources, Audiences, Destination Catalog, Source Catalog, PII Integrations, and Warehouse-native Amplitude capabilities. The platform ensures data quality and provides connectivity between various data sources and the broader Amplitude ecosystem.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities, allowing teams to safely deploy features, conduct controlled experiments, and make data-driven product decisions. It encompasses Experiment Theory, Advanced Techniques, Under the Hood functionality, Workflow management, Experiment Results analysis, and comprehensive Troubleshooting resources.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and reconstructs user sessions, providing visual insights into user behavior and enabling teams to identify usability issues and optimization opportunities through comprehensive session recordings and behavioral analytics.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** provides in-product user engagement capabilities, serving as an alternative to traditional popups for user onboarding, feedback collection, and improving retention, activation, and engagement metrics.

## Technical Integration Architecture

The platform provides multiple integration pathways through comprehensive SDK ecosystems and APIs:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser SDK, Android SDK, iOS SDK, React Native SDK, Flutter SDK, Node.js SDK, Java SDK, Go SDK, Python SDK, Unity SDK, and Unreal SDK, all accessible through routes like `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/{slug}`.

**Experiment SDKs** provide dedicated experimentation capabilities across platforms, accessible via `/sdks/experiment-sdks/{slug}`.

**Ampli** serves as a type-safe analytics wrapper, providing strongly-typed event tracking across platforms via `/sdks/ampli/{slug}`.

**APIs** encompass Analytics API (`/apis/analytics/{slug}`), Experiment APIs (`/apis/experiment/{slug}`), and Guides and Surveys API (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/{slug}`).

## Key Technical Nomenclature

**User Identification System**: The platform uses a dual-identifier approach with `user_id` (for authenticated users) and `device_id` (for device-level tracking), supplemented by `user_properties` for additional user context.

**Event Architecture**: Distinguishes between event properties (describing specific actions) and user properties (describing user characteristics), enabling granular behavioral analysis.

**Collections Structure**: The platform organizes content through hierarchical collections with specific routing patterns, mount points for content organization, and injection parameters for navigation context.

**Date Behavior**: Implements content visibility controls with `past: public` and `future: private` settings for managing content publication states.

**Preview Targets**: Provides content preview capabilities with refresh functionality for development and staging workflows.

**Navigation Injection**: Uses `nav_title` injection to organize content within specific navigation contexts (analytics, data, experiment, apis, etc.).

**Blade System**: Implements product-specific branding through blade injection (e.g., "Amplitude Experiment", "Amplitude Session Replay", "Amplitude Guides and Surveys").

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The platform integrates with data warehouse systems, enabling bidirectional data flow between Amplitude and enterprise data infrastructure. The **Partners** collection (`/partners/{slug}`) indicates extensive third-party integration capabilities.

**Multi-site Support**: The platform supports internationalization with English (`en`) and Japanese (`jp`) site variants, with dedicated Japanese translation collections.

**Content Organization**: Uses mount points (UUID-based identifiers) to organize related content across collections, enabling complex content relationships and hierarchical documentation structures.

**Migration Support**: Dedicated migration resources (`/migration/{slug}`) facilitate platform adoption and data transition workflows.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** (`/admin/account-management/{slug}`) provides user and organization administration capabilities.

**Single Sign-on** (`/admin/single-sign-on/{slug}`) enables enterprise authentication integration.

**Billing and Use** (`/admin/billing-use/{slug}`) offers usage monitoring and billing management functionality.

**Academy Content** provides educational resources and training materials for platform adoption.

**FAQ and Troubleshooting** (`/faq/{slug}`) delivers comprehensive support documentation across all product areas.

The documentation architecture supports multiple output formats and maintains a sophisticated content management system with preview capabilities, revision control, and structured navigation injection, indicating a mature enterprise-grade platform with comprehensive developer and user support resources.
