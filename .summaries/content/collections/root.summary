Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides product teams with tools to understand user behavior, optimize experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of four core products: Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, and Guides & Surveys, supported by a robust Customer Data Platform (CDP) and extensive SDK ecosystem.

## Core Product Architecture

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, offering multiple chart types for behavioral analysis including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Stickiness, Lifecycle, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, Revenue LTV, and Experiment Results. Each chart type provides specialized visualization and analysis capabilities for different aspects of user behavior.

**Amplitude Experiment** is a feature flagging and A/B testing platform that enables teams to safely deploy features and run experiments. It includes advanced techniques, experiment theory, workflow management, and comprehensive troubleshooting capabilities. The platform supports both client-side and server-side experimentation with statistical rigor.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and replays user sessions to provide qualitative insights into user behavior, complementing quantitative analytics data with visual context of user interactions.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** delivers in-product user engagement through contextual guides, feedback collection surveys, and resource centers, enabling teams to improve onboarding and gather user insights directly within applications.

## Customer Data Platform (CDP)

The CDP serves as the central data infrastructure, managing data ingestion, transformation, and activation across the ecosystem. Key components include:

- **Sources** for data collection from various touchpoints
- **Audiences** for user segmentation and targeting
- **Destination Catalog** with extensive third-party integrations
- **Source Catalog** supporting multiple data input methods
- **Warehouse-native Amplitude** for direct data warehouse integration
- **PII Integrations** for privacy-compliant data handling

## SDK Ecosystem and Instrumentation

Amplitude provides comprehensive SDKs across multiple platforms and languages:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal implementations, each optimized for their respective platforms with consistent API patterns and feature sets.

**Experiment SDKs** provide feature flagging and experimentation capabilities across the same platform ecosystem, enabling consistent A/B testing and feature management.

**Ampli** serves as a type-safe wrapper that generates strongly-typed tracking libraries from Amplitude's Data taxonomy, ensuring consistent and error-free event instrumentation across teams and platforms.

## API Infrastructure

The platform exposes comprehensive APIs for programmatic access:

- **Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/`) for data querying and analysis
- **Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) for feature flag and experiment management  
- **Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) for in-product experience management

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** represent user actions or system occurrences, tracked with properties and user context. **User Properties** describe user attributes, while **Event Properties** provide action-specific context.

**Cohorts** define user segments based on behavioral criteria or properties. **Funnels** track user progression through defined sequences. **Retention** measures user return behavior over time periods.

**Feature Flags** control feature visibility and behavior. **Experiments** compare different user experiences through statistical testing. **Variants** represent different experiment treatments.

**Sessions** group related user activities within time boundaries. **Journeys** map user paths through applications. **Lifecycle** stages categorize users by engagement patterns.

## Administrative and Management Features

**Account Management** provides organizational controls, user permissions, and access management. **Billing and Use** tracks platform usage and manages subscription details.

**Single Sign-on** enables enterprise authentication integration. **Admin** functions provide system-wide configuration and management capabilities.

## Integration and Partnership Ecosystem

The **Partners** program includes technology integrations, consulting services, and solution providers. The **Destination Catalog** and **Source Catalog** feature extensive third-party integrations categorized by function (analytics, marketing, data warehouses, etc.).

## Developer Resources and Support

**Get Started** guides provide onboarding paths for different user types and use cases. **Migration** resources assist with platform transitions and data imports.

**FAQ and Troubleshooting** sections provide comprehensive support documentation. **Academy Content** offers educational resources for platform mastery.

## Multi-language Support

The platform includes **Japanese Translation** capabilities, indicating international market support with localized content and interfaces.

## Technical Implementation Patterns

Route structures follow consistent patterns:
- `/analytics/` for core analytics features
- `/sdks/` for SDK documentation and resources  
- `/apis/` for API references
- `/data/` for CDP and data management features
- `/feature-experiment/` for experimentation capabilities
- `/admin/` for administrative functions

The platform uses mount points to organize related content hierarchically, with navigation injection for consistent user experience across product areas. Preview targets enable content review workflows, while date behaviors control content visibility based on publication status.

This comprehensive platform enables organizations to implement complete product analytics and experimentation workflows, from data collection through analysis to optimization, supported by extensive developer tools and enterprise-grade administrative capabilities.
