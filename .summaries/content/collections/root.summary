## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Analytics Terms
- **Event**: A specific user action or system occurrence tracked in Amplitude
- **User**: An individual interacting with a product, identified by a unique ID
- **Session**: A period of continuous user activity
- **Cohort**: A group of users who share common characteristics
- **Funnel**: A series of steps users take toward a conversion goal
- **Retention**: Measurement of how many users return to a product over time
- **Lifecycle**: Classification of users as new, returning, resurrected, or dormant
- **Stickiness**: Measurement of how frequently users perform specific actions

### Experimentation Terms
- **Experiment**: A controlled test comparing different variations
- **Variant**: A specific version being tested in an experiment
- **Control**: The baseline version in an experiment
- **Feature Flag**: A toggle for enabling/disabling features for specific users
- **Bucketing**: The process of assigning users to experiment variants
- **Statistical Significance**: Confidence level that results aren't due to chance

### Data Management Terms
- **Source**: Origin point of data (website, app, server)
- **Destination**: Platform where data is sent for activation
- **Audience**: A defined segment of users based on behaviors or attributes
- **Identity Resolution**: Process of connecting user identities across platforms
- **Data Warehouse**: Storage system for large volumes of structured data

## Product Relationships

### Data Flow Architecture
1. **Data Collection**: Events are captured through SDKs or APIs
2. **Data Processing**: Raw data is processed, enriched, and stored
3. **Analysis**: Data is analyzed through charts, tables, and other tools
4. **Activation**: Insights drive actions through experiments or integrations

### Integration Points
- **SDK to Analytics**: SDKs send event data to the Analytics platform
- **Analytics to Experiment**: User segments from Analytics can be targeted in Experiments
- **Experiment to SDKs**: Experiment configurations are delivered to SDKs
- **Analytics to Guides**: User behavior data informs guide targeting
- **Guides to Analytics**: Guide interaction data flows back to Analytics

### Cross-Product Features
- **Navigation**: Consistent navigation structure across products with section-specific menus
- **User Identity**: Unified user identification across all products
- **Permissions**: Role-based access control across the platform
- **Taxonomies**: Shared categorization systems (e.g., integration_category)

## Technical Implementation

### SDK Implementation
```javascript
// Browser SDK initialization
amplitude.init('API_KEY', 'USER_ID', {
  logLevel: 'INFO',
  serverUrl: 'https://api.amplitude.com'
});

// Tracking an event
amplitude.track('Button Clicked', {
  buttonColor: 'blue',
  buttonText: 'Submit'
});
```

### API Endpoints
- Analytics API: `https://api.amplitude.com/`
- Experiment API: `https://experiment.amplitude.com/api/`

### Command Line Usage
For data import/export operations:
```bash
amplitude-cli export --start=YYYY-MM-DD --end=YYYY-MM-DD --event=event_name
```

## Documentation Structure
