# Amplitude Product Ecosystem

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics platform that helps organizations understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive business growth. The platform consists of several interconnected products and features that collectively enable data collection, analysis, experimentation, and data management.

Key features of the Amplitude ecosystem include:
- Analytics capabilities for tracking user behavior and product performance
- Experimentation tools for A/B testing and feature flagging
- Data management solutions for collecting, processing, and organizing user data
- SDKs for various platforms to instrument applications and collect data
- Integration capabilities with third-party tools and data warehouses
- Specialized visualization tools like charts, funnels, and session replay

## Product Relationships and Structure

The Amplitude ecosystem consists of several core products that work together:

1. **Analytics** - The foundation of the platform, providing behavioral analytics capabilities through various chart types and visualization tools:
   - Charts (Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, Revenue LTV, User Sessions, etc.)
   - Event Segmentation
   - Journeys
   - Personas
   - Compass
   - Impact Analysis
   - Engagement Matrix

2. **Experiment** - A feature experimentation platform:
   - Experiment Theory
   - Advanced Techniques
   - Workflow
   - Under the Hood
   - APIs and SDKs specific to experimentation
   - Troubleshooting guides

3. **Data** - Tools for data collection, management, and integration:
   - Sources (data collection)
   - Audiences (user segmentation)
   - Destination Catalog (data export)
   - Source Catalog (data import)
   - PII Integrations (privacy management)
   - CDP (Customer Data Platform)

4. **SDKs** - Software Development Kits for instrumenting applications:
   - Platform-specific SDKs (Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal)
   - Language-specific SDKs (JavaScript, Java, Python, Go, Node.js)
   - Ampli (code generation tool for type-safe instrumentation)

5. **Session Replay** - Visual analytics tool that captures and recreates user interactions

6. **Admin** - Administrative tools and settings:
   - Account Management
   - Billing and Usage
   - Single Sign-On

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Events**: User actions or system occurrences tracked in Amplitude
- **Properties**: Metadata associated with events that provide context
- **User Properties**: Attributes associated with users
- **Cohorts**: Groups of users who share common behaviors or attributes
- **Funnels**: Visualization of user progression through a sequence of events
- **Retention**: Analysis of how users continue to engage with a product over time
- **Journeys**: Visualization of user paths through a product
- **Experiment**: A controlled test comparing different variations of a feature
- **Feature Flag**: A toggle that enables or disables features for specific users
- **Source**: A data origin point that sends data to Amplitude
- **Destination**: A system that receives data from Amplitude
- **SDK (Software Development Kit)**: Libraries that enable data collection from applications
- **Ampli**: A code generation tool that creates type-safe wrappers around Amplitude SDKs
- **Session Replay**: Feature that records and plays back user interactions with a website or app

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude ecosystem is designed for seamless integration between its components:

1. **Data Collection and Processing Flow**:
   - SDKs collect data from applications
   - Data is sent to Amplitude's servers through APIs
   - Data is processed and made available for analysis in Analytics
   - Processed data can be exported to destinations or used for experimentation

2. **Analytics and Experimentation Connection**:
   - Analytics insights inform experiment hypotheses
   - Experiment results are analyzed using Analytics tools
   - Impact Analysis helps quantify experiment outcomes

3. **Data Management Integration**:
   - Sources feed data into the Analytics platform
   - Audiences created in Analytics can be exported to Destinations
   - CDP connects customer data across the platform

4. **Cross-Platform Capabilities**:
   - Consistent data collection across web and mobile platforms
   - Unified user identity across devices and platforms
   - Integrated analysis across all customer touchpoints

## API Endpoints and Implementation

### Analytics API
- Base URL: `/apis/analytics/`
- Key endpoints for querying analytics data and managing resources

### Experiment APIs
- Base URL: `/apis/experiment/`
- Endpoints for managing experiments, feature flags, and targeting rules

### SDK Implementation Examples

**Browser SDK**:
```javascript
import * as amplitude from '@amplitude/analytics-browser';
amplitude.init('API_KEY');
amplitude.track('Button Clicked', { buttonColor: 'blue' });
```

**iOS SDK**:
```swift
import AmplitudeSwift
let amplitude = Amplitude(configuration: Configuration(apiKey: "API_KEY"))
amplitude.track(eventType: "Button Clicked", eventProperties: ["buttonColor": "blue"])
```

**Android SDK**:
```kotlin
import com.amplitude.android.Amplitude
val amplitude = Amplitude(Configuration(apiKey = "API_KEY"))
amplitude.track("Button Clicked", mapOf("buttonColor" to "blue"))
```

**Ampli SDK** (code-generated wrapper):
```javascript
import { ampli } from './ampli';
ampli.load({ client: { apiKey: 'API_KEY' } });
ampli.buttonClicked({ buttonColor: 'blue' });
```

### Session Replay Implementation

**Browser Integration**:
```javascript
import * as amplitude from '@amplitude/analytics-browser';
import { sessionReplayPlugin } from '@amplitude/session-replay-browser';
amplitude.init('API_KEY');
amplitude.add(sessionReplayPlugin());
```

The Amplitude platform provides a comprehensive suite of tools for product analytics, experimentation, and data management, with extensive integration capabilities and support for multiple platforms and programming languages. The ecosystem is designed to help organizations understand user behavior, make data-driven decisions, and optimize product experiences.
