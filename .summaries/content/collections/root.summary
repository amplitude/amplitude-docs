Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of several interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment (A/B testing), Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP), all supported by extensive SDK libraries and API integrations.

## Product and Feature Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem is structured around several core product areas that work together to provide end-to-end product intelligence:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational product, offering multiple chart types for behavioral analysis including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, and Revenue LTV. These charts enable teams to analyze user behavior patterns, conversion flows, and product performance metrics.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities, with dedicated sections for experiment theory, advanced techniques, workflow management, troubleshooting, and "under the hood" technical details. The platform includes specialized Experiment Results charts for analyzing test performance and statistical significance.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user session recordings to provide qualitative insights into user behavior and identify friction points in the product experience.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product messaging, user onboarding flows, and feedback collection to improve user engagement and gather qualitative insights.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and routing through source and destination catalogs, audience management, and warehouse-native capabilities for enterprise data infrastructure.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Collections** represent content groupings that organize documentation by product area, feature set, or user journey. Each collection has specific routing patterns (e.g., `/analytics/{slug}`, `/feature-experiment/{slug}`), navigation injection points, and content management settings.

**Navigation Injection** uses `nav_title` properties to organize content within the documentation structure, with key navigation areas including:
- `analytics` - Core analytics features and charts
- `experiment` - A/B testing and feature flag functionality  
- `data` - CDP, sources, destinations, and data management
- `apis` - REST API documentation and integration guides
- `analytics_sdks` and `experiment_sdks` - SDK documentation by platform
- `get_started` - Onboarding and initial setup content
- `admin` - Account management, billing, and SSO configuration

**Blade Injection** identifies specific Amplitude products within the broader platform:
- "Amplitude Experiment" for A/B testing features
- "Amplitude Session Replay" for session recording capabilities
- "Amplitude Guides and Surveys" for in-product messaging

**Mount Points** (UUID identifiers) link collections to specific content repositories, enabling modular content management and cross-referencing between related documentation sections.

**Route Patterns** define URL structures that reflect the product hierarchy, such as `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/{slug}` for specific chart documentation or `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/{slug}` for platform-specific SDK guides.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude operates as a comprehensive product intelligence platform where multiple products work synergistically:

**Data Flow Architecture** begins with instrumentation through Analytics SDKs (Android, iOS, Browser, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, Unreal) and server-side APIs. Data flows through the CDP for processing, enrichment, and routing to various Amplitude products and external destinations.

**Cross-Product Integration** enables workflows where Analytics insights inform Experiment targeting, Session Replay provides context for funnel drop-offs identified in Analytics, and Guides and Surveys collect feedback based on behavioral segments created in Analytics.

**Identity Resolution** unifies user journeys across platforms through consistent user_id and device_id tracking, enabling cross-platform analysis and personalization.

**Partner Ecosystem** extends functionality through integrations with marketing automation platforms, data warehouses, attribution providers, and other analytics tools via the source and destination catalogs.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Primary API Categories**:
- **Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/{slug}`) - Event ingestion, query, and export capabilities
- **Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/{slug}`) - Feature flag management and assignment
- **Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/{slug}`) - In-product messaging control

**SDK Implementation Patterns**:
- Platform-specific SDKs follow consistent initialization, configuration, and event tracking patterns
- **Ampli** provides type-safe, code-generated SDKs that enforce tracking plans and data governance
- Server-side SDKs support batch processing and high-volume event ingestion

**Multi-Site Architecture** supports internationalization with English (`en`) and Japanese (`jp`) site variants, enabling localized documentation and user experiences.

**Content Management Features**:
- Revision control and preview capabilities for content updates
- Date-based publishing with past/future content visibility controls
- Taxonomies for organizing integration catalogs by category and type
- Structured content hierarchies with root-level pages and nested collections

**Administrative Capabilities** include account management, billing and usage monitoring, single sign-on configuration, and user permission management, all accessible through dedicated admin routes and interfaces.

The platform architecture reflects Amplitude's position as an enterprise-grade product analytics solution that scales from startup implementation to large organization deployment, with comprehensive developer tools, extensive integration capabilities, and advanced administrative controls for data governance and user management.
