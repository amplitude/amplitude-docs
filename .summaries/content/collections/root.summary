## Amplitude Analytics Platform

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides product teams with tools for user behavior analysis, feature experimentation, data management, and customer engagement. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Product Architecture and Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem is organized around several core product areas that work together to provide end-to-end analytics and experimentation capabilities:

**Analytics Core** - The foundational analytics platform featuring multiple chart types for behavioral analysis:
- Event Segmentation for user action analysis
- Funnel Analysis for conversion tracking  
- Retention Analysis for user engagement measurement
- User Sessions and Journeys for path analysis
- Revenue LTV for monetization insights
- Cohort analysis through Compass, Lifecycle, Personas, and Stickiness charts
- Engagement Matrix and Impact Analysis for advanced behavioral insights

**Amplitude Experiment** - Feature flagging and A/B testing platform with integrated analytics, including:
- Experiment design and statistical analysis theory
- Advanced targeting and segmentation techniques
- Results analysis through dedicated chart types
- Workflow management for experiment lifecycle
- Deep technical implementation guides ("Under the Hood")

**Session Replay** - User session recording and analysis for qualitative insights into user behavior and experience optimization.

**Guides and Surveys** - In-product messaging and feedback collection tools for user engagement and research.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** - Comprehensive data management including:
- Source and destination catalogs for data integration
- Audience building and segmentation
- Data governance and PII management
- Warehouse-native capabilities for existing data infrastructure

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Concepts

**Collections Structure** - Documentation is organized into collections representing product areas, with hierarchical routing patterns like `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/{slug}` and `/feature-experiment/{category}/{slug}`.

**Mount Points** - Many collections use mount identifiers (UUIDs) to link content across the platform, enabling cross-referencing between related documentation sections.

**Navigation Injection** - Each collection injects specific navigation contexts (`nav_title`) such as `analytics`, `experiment`, `data`, `apis`, enabling contextual documentation browsing.

**Blade Architecture** - Product-specific branding and functionality injection, with collections tagged for "Amplitude Experiment", "Amplitude Session Replay", and "Amplitude Guides and Surveys".

**Site Propagation** - Multi-language support with English (`en`) as primary and Japanese (`jp`) translations, with controlled propagation settings across collections.

**Preview Targets** - All collections support live preview functionality with automatic refresh capabilities for documentation updates.

## SDK and API Ecosystem

**Analytics SDKs** - Comprehensive instrumentation libraries across platforms:
- Web: Browser SDK with advanced autocapture and attribution
- Mobile: iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter
- Server-side: Node.js, Python, Java, Go
- Gaming: Unity, Unreal Engine
- **Ampli** - Code generation tool creating type-safe tracking implementations from data schemas

**Experiment SDKs** - Dedicated feature flagging and experimentation SDKs for consistent experiment delivery across platforms.

**API Endpoints** - RESTful APIs for:
- Analytics data ingestion and querying (`/apis/analytics/`)
- Experiment configuration and evaluation (`/apis/experiment/`)  
- Guides and Surveys management (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`)

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** - Organization-level controls for user access, permissions, and resource allocation.

**Single Sign-On (SSO)** - Enterprise authentication integration for secure access management.

**Billing and Usage** - Consumption monitoring and billing management for enterprise deployments.

**Data Governance** - PII handling, compliance controls, and data retention policies.

## Integration and Partner Ecosystem

**Source Catalog** - Pre-built integrations for data ingestion from various platforms and services, categorized by integration type.

**Destination Catalog** - Data export and activation integrations for marketing, analytics, and business intelligence tools.

**Partners Program** - Third-party integrations and professional services ecosystem.

**Experiment Integrations** - Platform-specific integrations for feature flag delivery and experiment analysis.

## Migration and Onboarding

**Get Started** - Comprehensive onboarding flows for new users and organizations.

**Migration Guides** - Platform-specific migration assistance for users transitioning from other analytics or experimentation platforms.

**Academy Content** - Educational resources and best practices for analytics implementation and experimentation methodology.

**FAQ and Troubleshooting** - Self-service support resources with platform-specific troubleshooting guides.

The Amplitude platform represents a unified approach to product analytics and experimentation, with deep integration between behavioral analysis, feature testing, and data management capabilities. The modular architecture allows teams to adopt individual components while benefiting from cross-product insights and unified data models.
