It offers various visualization tools including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, Pathfinder/Journey, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Revenue LTV, Compass, Personas, and Impact Analysis. The platform also includes collaboration features like Dashboards, Notebooks, Templates, and Breadcrumbs to help teams share insights.

### Data
Amplitude Data serves as the data management layer, providing tools for:
- Data collection through SDKs and APIs
- Data governance with tracking plans and schema management
- Data quality validation and transformations
- Identity resolution across devices and sessions
- Integration with data warehouses (Warehouse-native Amplitude)

Key features include Tracking Plans, Ampli Developer Toolkit, Property Groups, Transformations, Custom Events, Derived Properties, and Lookup Tables.

### Experiment
Amplitude Experiment enables teams to test hypotheses and optimize features through:
- A/B testing with statistical rigor
- Feature flag management
- Progressive feature delivery
- Local and remote evaluation modes
- Holdout groups and mutual exclusion groups
- Integration with analytics for results analysis

The platform supports both client-side and server-side implementations with SDKs for various programming languages.

### Session Replay
This qualitative analytics tool records and plays back user sessions to provide visual context to quantitative data. It offers:
- Video-like replays of user interactions
- Heatmaps (click maps, selector maps, scroll maps)
- Privacy controls with multiple masking levels
- Cross-platform support (web, iOS, Android, React Native)

### Guides and Surveys
An in-product messaging and feedback collection solution that helps improve user experience through:
- Various templates (Tours, Announcements, Checklists, Banners, Tooltips)
- Multiple form factors (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner)
- Audience segmentation and targeting
- Survey capabilities (NPS, User Feedback, Rating)

## Key Nomenclature

- **Events**: User actions tracked in Amplitude (page views, button clicks, etc.)
- **Event Properties**: Metadata associated with events providing context
- **User Properties**: Attributes associated with users that persist across sessions
- **Cohorts**: Groups of users who share common behaviors or attributes
- **Amplitude ID**: Internal identifier that links Device IDs and User IDs
- **Variant**: A specific version in an experiment
- **Feature Flag**: Toggle that enables/disables features for specific users
- **Tracking Plan**: Schema defining events and properties to be collected
- **Bucketing**: Process of assigning users to experiment variants
- **Exposure Event**: Analytics event recording when a user sees an experiment variant

## Implementation Methods

### SDKs
Amplitude provides SDKs for various platforms:
- **Browser/JavaScript**: For web applications
- **iOS/Android**: For mobile applications
- **Server-side**: Node.js, Python, Java, Go, etc.
- **Game engines**: Unity, Unreal
- **Cross-platform**: React Native, Flutter

### APIs
- **HTTP V2 API**: Primary endpoint for sending events
- **Identify API**: Updates user properties without sending events
- **Batch API**: Sends multiple events in a single request
- **Export API**: Retrieves raw event data
- **Experiment APIs**: Manages and evaluates experiments

### Ampli
The Ampli CLI and wrapper provide type-safe tracking implementation based on tracking plans defined in Amplitude Data, ensuring data quality and consistency.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's products are designed to work together in an integrated workflow:
1. **Data** forms the foundation, ensuring quality information flows into the system
2. **Analytics** builds on this data to provide actionable insights
3. **Experiment** enables testing hypotheses derived from analytics
4. **Session Replay** provides qualitative validation of quantitative findings
5. **Guides and Surveys** facilitates direct user engagement based on insights

This integrated approach creates a seamless workflow from data collection to insight generation to action, allowing teams to make informed product decisions based on user behavior data.
