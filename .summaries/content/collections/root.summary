## Amplitude Analytics and Experimentation Platform

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools for product analytics, feature experimentation, customer data management, and user engagement optimization. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products designed to support data-driven decision making throughout the product development lifecycle.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem is built around several core product areas that work together to provide end-to-end analytics and experimentation capabilities:

**Analytics Core**: The foundation consists of Amplitude Analytics, which provides event-based tracking and analysis through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Impact Analysis, Revenue LTV, and Engagement Matrix. These charts enable teams to understand user behavior patterns, conversion flows, and product performance metrics.

**Experimentation Suite**: Amplitude Experiment provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities through multiple components including experiment theory, advanced techniques, workflow management, troubleshooting tools, and "under the hood" technical implementation details. The platform supports both server-side and client-side experimentation with dedicated SDKs and APIs.

**Data Management Layer**: The Customer Data Platform (CDP) functionality includes data sources and destinations, audience management, warehouse-native capabilities, and PII (Personally Identifiable Information) handling. This layer manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation across the entire customer data ecosystem.

**Developer Tools and SDKs**: Comprehensive instrumentation support through platform-specific SDKs including Android, iOS, Browser (JavaScript), React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine. The Ampli developer tool provides type-safe analytics implementation, while various APIs enable programmatic access to platform functionality.

**Specialized Products**: Session Replay provides user session recording and analysis, while Guides and Surveys enables in-product user research and engagement. These products integrate with the core analytics platform to provide additional user insight capabilities.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events and Properties**: The fundamental data model consists of events (user actions) and properties (attributes describing events, users, or groups). Event tracking forms the basis for all analytics and experimentation analysis.

**Charts and Visualizations**: Pre-built analysis templates that enable specific types of behavioral analysis, from basic event segmentation to complex multi-step funnel analysis and cohort retention studies.

**Feature Flags and Experiments**: Feature flags control feature rollouts and enable A/B testing, while experiments provide statistical analysis of variant performance with proper randomization and significance testing.

**Cohorts and Audiences**: User segments defined by behavioral criteria or properties, used for targeted analysis and experiment assignment.

**Sources and Destinations**: Data integration points where sources bring data into Amplitude (SDKs, APIs, third-party tools) and destinations send data to external systems for activation.

**Instrumentation**: The process of implementing event tracking code in applications, supported by SDKs and the Ampli code generation tool for type-safe implementation.

**Mount Points**: Technical configuration elements (referenced by UUIDs in the collection files) that define how content is organized and routed within the documentation system.

## Ecosystem Integration and Workflow

Amplitude integrates into broader product development and marketing technology stacks through multiple touchpoints. The platform supports both first-party data collection through native SDKs and third-party data ingestion through source catalogs covering major marketing, product, and customer success tools.

The typical workflow involves instrumentation planning and implementation, followed by analytics setup and dashboard creation, leading to hypothesis-driven experimentation and feature development. Results from experiments inform product decisions, which then drive further instrumentation and analysis in a continuous improvement cycle.

Administrative capabilities include account management, billing and usage monitoring, single sign-on integration, and partner ecosystem management. The platform supports enterprise requirements through comprehensive access controls and integration capabilities.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Core APIs**:
- Analytics API (`/apis/analytics/{slug}`): Programmatic access to event data and analysis results
- Experiment APIs (`/apis/experiment/{slug}`): Feature flag management and experiment configuration
- Guides and Surveys API (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/{slug}`): In-product messaging and survey management

**SDK Implementation Patterns**:
- Analytics SDKs follow consistent patterns across platforms with routes like `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/{slug}`
- Experiment SDKs provide feature flag evaluation with dedicated endpoints (`/sdks/experiment-sdks/{slug}`)
- Ampli code generation tool provides type-safe wrappers (`/sdks/ampli/{slug}`)

**Data Integration Routes**:
- Source catalog for data ingestion (`/data/source-catalog/{slug}`)
- Destination catalog for data activation (`/data/destination-catalog/{slug}`)
- Warehouse-native implementation for cloud data warehouse integration (`/data/warehouse-native/{slug}`)

**Administrative Interfaces**:
- Account management (`/admin/account-management/{slug}`)
- Billing and usage tracking (`/admin/billing-use/{slug}`)
- Single sign-on configuration (`/admin/single-sign-on/{slug}`)

The platform architecture emphasizes developer experience through comprehensive documentation, multiple implementation options, and extensive integration capabilities. Multi-language support includes Japanese localization, while the academy content provides educational resources for platform adoption and best practices.

The routing structure reveals a hierarchical organization where major product areas (analytics, experiment, data, admin) contain specialized sub-sections, enabling teams to find relevant documentation based on their specific use cases and technical requirements.
