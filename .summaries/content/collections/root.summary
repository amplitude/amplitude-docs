Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform combines behavioral analytics, feature experimentation, session replay, customer data management, and user engagement tools into an integrated ecosystem for product teams, marketers, and data professionals.

## Core Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

Amplitude operates on an event-driven architecture where user interactions are captured as events with associated properties, supporting both individual user analytics and account-level B2B reporting through the Accounts add-on. The platform consists of several interconnected products:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational behavioral analytics engine, featuring Event Segmentation charts for measuring user actions over time, Funnel Analysis for conversion tracking, Retention Analysis for user return behavior, and advanced visualization tools including Compass, Data Tables, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, Journeys, Lifecycle, Personas, Revenue LTV, Stickiness, and User Sessions charts. The analytics platform supports Historical Count filtering, anomaly detection via Prophet algorithms, and Root Cause Analysis for investigating data patterns.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced techniques, experiment theory, workflow management, and comprehensive results analysis. The platform includes experiment-specific APIs and SDKs for implementation across multiple platforms.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures user interactions for qualitative analysis, integrating with analytics data to provide context for behavioral patterns and user experience optimization.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** functionality includes audience management, data governance through tracking plans, source and destination catalogs for data integration, warehouse-native capabilities, and PII management tools.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events and Properties**: Events represent user actions (clicks, page views, purchases) while event properties contain contextual data and user properties represent persistent user attributes. Group properties enable account-level analytics for B2B use cases.

**Tracking Plans**: Schema definitions that specify events, properties, and taxonomy, serving as the foundation for data governance and code generation through Ampli.

**Ampli**: Code generation toolkit that creates type-safe wrappers for Amplitude SDKs based on tracking plan definitions, enabling developers to implement analytics with compile-time validation.

**Behavioral Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments based on actions and properties within specific time periods, supporting event counting methods and temporal parameters for sophisticated user segmentation.

**Historical Count**: Specialized filtering that tracks up to the 5th instance of user actions with a one-year lookback period, enabling analysis of user behavior patterns over time.

**Autocapture**: Automated tracking of user interactions including sessions, screen views, element interactions, and form submissions with minimal setup requirements.

**Derived Properties**: Retroactively created properties using formula functions like PROPERTY(), REGEXEXTRACT(), and SPLIT() that operate without modifying raw data.

**Visual Labeling**: No-code event creation through DOM element interaction, enabling non-technical users to create labeled events by clicking website elements.

**Data Mutability**: INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations on event data through Mirror Sync strategies with Change Data Capture (CDC) for real-time synchronization.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates extensively across the modern data and marketing technology stack through multiple integration patterns:

**Data Ingestion** occurs through client-side SDKs (Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Unity, Flutter, Unreal) and server-side SDKs (Node.js, Go, Python, Java), plus third-party integrations via the source catalog. The platform supports real-time streaming via HTTP V2 API and batch processing through Batch Event Upload API.

**Data Activation** happens through the destination catalog featuring 100+ integrations spanning marketing automation (Braze, Customer.io, Intercom), advertising networks (Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads), and enterprise data infrastructure (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift). Event streaming destinations forward real-time behavioral data while cohort synchronization distributes audiences for targeted campaigns.

**Collaboration Tools** include Slack integration for chart sharing and notifications, Google Workspace integration through Sync to Drive, Atlassian Smart Links for Confluence and Jira, Miro integration for chart embedding, and Notion integration for documentation workflows.

**Enterprise Features** encompass Data Access Control (DAC) with property classification and group-based permissions, Single Sign-On (SSO) integration, SCIM API for user provisioning, and comprehensive billing and usage management.
