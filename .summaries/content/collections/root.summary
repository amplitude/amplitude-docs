## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude operates as a unified platform where products complement each other:

**Analytics-Experiment Integration:**
- Experiment results automatically flow into Analytics charts
- Behavioral cohorts from Analytics can be used as experiment audiences
- Statistical analysis tools are shared between products

**CDP-Analytics Connection:**
- CDP manages data quality and governance for Analytics
- Audiences created in Analytics can be activated through CDP destinations
- Source catalog feeds data into both Analytics and CDP

**Cross-Product Data Flow:**
- Session Replay sessions can be filtered by Analytics cohorts
- Guides and Surveys can target users based on Analytics segments
- All products share common user identification and properties

**Administrative Integration:**
- **Account Management** - User provisioning and permissions
- **Single Sign-On** - Enterprise authentication
- **Billing and Use** - Usage tracking and plan management
- **PII Integrations** - Privacy and compliance tools
