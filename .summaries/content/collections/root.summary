Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides end-to-end solutions for product analytics, feature experimentation, customer data management, and user engagement. The platform serves organizations seeking to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive data-driven decision making across web, mobile, and server-side applications.

## Core Product Architecture

**Analytics Foundation**
Amplitude Analytics forms the platform's core, offering behavioral analytics through multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Stickiness, Lifecycle, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, Revenue LTV, and Experiment Results. These charts operate on event-based data models tracking user interactions, properties, and behavioral patterns over time.

**Experimentation Platform**
Amplitude Experiment provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced statistical analysis, supporting client-side and server-side experiments. The platform includes experiment theory documentation, advanced techniques, workflow management, troubleshooting guides, and "under the hood" technical implementation details.

**Data Management Layer**
Amplitude Data serves as a comprehensive data governance platform with tracking plans, schema validation, data quality monitoring, and the Ampli developer toolkit for type-safe instrumentation. The Customer Data Platform (CDP) includes audience management, source/destination catalogs, and warehouse-native capabilities.

**Specialized Products**
- **Session Replay**: Visual user session recording and analysis
- **Guides and Surveys**: In-product user engagement and feedback collection  
- **Web Experiment**: Browser-based experimentation tools
- **Agents**: AI-powered analytics assistance

## SDK and Integration Ecosystem

**Client-Side SDKs**
The platform provides comprehensive SDKs for Browser (JavaScript/TypeScript), Android (Java/Kotlin), iOS (Swift/Objective-C), React Native, Flutter, Unity, and Unreal Engine. Each SDK supports both analytics tracking and experiment evaluation with platform-specific optimizations.

**Server-Side SDKs**  
Server-side instrumentation includes Node.js, Python, Java, and Go SDKs for backend event tracking and experiment evaluation. The Ampli toolkit generates type-safe wrappers for all supported languages.

**Framework Integrations**
Specialized integrations exist for popular frameworks and platforms, with the SDK catalog providing comprehensive implementation guides and best practices for each supported technology stack.
