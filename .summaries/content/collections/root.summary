Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools for understanding user behavior, conducting A/B tests, and managing feature rollouts. The platform consists of several interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Core Product Architecture

The platform is built around several primary products that work together to provide a complete digital optimization solution:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, providing event tracking, user behavior analysis, and comprehensive reporting through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, Cohort Analysis, and User Journey mapping.

**Amplitude Experiment** is the feature flagging and A/B testing platform that enables controlled feature rollouts and experimentation. It supports both remote and local evaluation modes, with comprehensive SDK coverage across web, mobile, and server-side platforms.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and replays user sessions to provide visual insights into user interactions and identify friction points in the user experience.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product messaging, user onboarding flows, and feedback collection through targeted surveys and interactive guides.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation across the entire customer data ecosystem, including source and destination integrations.

## Product Relationships and Data Flow

The products are deeply integrated through shared user identity management and event tracking systems. Analytics serves as the central data repository, collecting events from SDKs and feeding user behavior data to other products. Experiment leverages Analytics data for audience targeting and automatic exposure tracking. Session Replay sessions can be analyzed alongside Analytics events to provide comprehensive user journey insights.

The CDP orchestrates data flow between external systems and Amplitude products, while also enabling data activation to downstream marketing and analytics tools. Audiences created in Analytics can be synced to Experiment for precise targeting, and experiment results are automatically tracked as Analytics events.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Concepts

**Events and Properties**: The fundamental data model consists of events (user actions) with associated event properties and user properties that describe the context and attributes of those actions.

**Amplitude ID and Device ID**: Core user identification system where Device ID tracks anonymous users and Amplitude ID provides cross-platform user identity resolution.

**Cohorts and Audiences**: User segments created based on behavioral criteria that can be used across products for targeting and analysis.

**Deployment Keys**: Authentication credentials that control access to specific project environments and determine available feature flag configurations.

**Variants and Feature Flags**: Experiment configurations that control feature availability and A/B test experiences delivered to users.

**Charts and Dashboards**: Analytics visualization tools that transform raw event data into actionable insights through various analysis methodologies.

**Sources and Destinations**: CDP components that handle data ingestion from external systems and data activation to downstream tools.

## SDK and API Ecosystem

The platform provides extensive SDK coverage across multiple platforms and programming languages:

**Analytics SDKs** are available for Browser (JavaScript), Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine, providing comprehensive event tracking capabilities.

**Experiment SDKs** mirror the Analytics SDK coverage while adding specialized evaluation capabilities for feature flags and A/B tests, supporting both client-side and server-side implementations.

**Ampli** is a code generation tool that creates type-safe tracking libraries based on defined tracking plans, ensuring data quality and consistency across implementations.

**REST APIs** provide programmatic access to all platform functionality, including the Analytics API for event ingestion and querying, Experiment APIs for flag management, and specialized APIs for Guides and Surveys.

## Implementation Patterns and Integration

Common implementation patterns include:

- **Native Integration**: Direct SDK implementation with `amplitude.init()` for Analytics and `Experiment.initialize()` for feature flagging
- **Third-party Analytics Integration**: Support for Segment, mParticle, and other customer data platforms through provider interfaces
- **Server-side Evaluation**: Local evaluation capabilities with `evaluateV2()` methods and real-time configuration updates
- **Cross-platform Identity**: Consistent user identification across web and mobile through device ID synchronization

**Route Structures** follow consistent patterns:
- Analytics: `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/{slug}`
- SDKs: `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/{slug}` and `/sdks/experiment-sdks/{slug}`
- APIs: `/apis/{product}/{slug}`
- Data Management: `/data/{feature}/{slug}`
- Administration: `/admin/{feature}/{slug}`

## Enterprise and Advanced Features

The platform includes enterprise-grade capabilities such as:

**Data Residency**: EU data center support through `serverZone` configuration for compliance requirements.

**Single Sign-On**: Enterprise authentication integration for secure access management.

**Warehouse-native Architecture**: Direct integration with data warehouses for analysis without data movement.

**Advanced Targeting**: Cohort synchronization, behavioral targeting, and real-time audience updates for precise experiment targeting.

**PII Management**: Specialized integrations and controls for handling personally identifiable information in compliance with privacy regulations.

The platform supports both cloud-hosted and on-premises deployment options, with Docker containers available for the Evaluation Proxy and comprehensive Kubernetes support for enterprise deployments.
