This directory contains configuration files for Amplitude's documentation collections, representing a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform. Here's a detailed analysis:

## High-Level Product Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform consisting of four core products:

- **Amplitude Analytics**: Behavioral analytics platform with 16+ chart types for user behavior analysis, conversion tracking, and retention measurement
- **Amplitude Data**: Customer data platform (CDP) with data governance, tracking plan management, and warehouse-native capabilities  
- **Amplitude Experiment**: Feature flagging and A/B testing platform supporting both traditional experiments and multi-armed bandit optimization
- **Amplitude Session Replay**: User session recording and analysis for web, mobile, and React Native applications

The platform serves as a unified analytics ecosystem where behavioral data flows between products through shared user identification systems and event tracking infrastructure.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The collections reveal a sophisticated multi-layered architecture:

**Data Foundation Layer**: Sources, instrumentation, and data management form the base layer, with 70+ integrations through the Source Catalog and comprehensive SDK support across 11+ platforms (Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity, etc.).

**Analytics Layer**: Multiple chart types work together - Event Segmentation for behavior analysis, Funnel Analysis for conversion tracking, Retention Analysis for engagement measurement, and specialized charts like Personas (ML-based clustering) and Compass (retention threshold identification).

**Experimentation Layer**: Amplitude Experiment provides both remote and local evaluation modes, with sophisticated traffic management through mutual exclusion groups and holdout testing.

**Activation Layer**: Guides and Surveys for user engagement, plus extensive destination catalog (100+ integrations) for data activation across marketing and product tools.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Identity System**:
- `amplitude_id`: Internal persistent user identifier
- `user_id`: Customer-defined identifier  
- `device_id`: Platform-specific device identifier
- Cross-device identity resolution maintains user continuity

**Event Architecture**:
- Events represent user actions with associated properties
- User properties are persistent attributes across sessions
- Group properties enable account-level B2B analytics
- Revenue events support monetization tracking with verification

**Experimentation Concepts**:
- Variants define different experiment experiences
- Bucketing assigns users to variants using consistent hashing
- Exposure events track when users see variants
- Sequential testing enables continuous statistical monitoring

**Analytics Measurements**:
- MTU (Monthly Tracked Users): Primary billing metric
- Behavioral cohorts: Dynamic user segments based on actions
- Retention analysis: User return behavior measurement
- Funnel conversion: Multi-step user journey analysis

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The platform integrates extensively across the modern data and marketing stack:

**Data Infrastructure**: Native integrations with Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks for warehouse-native analytics. Support for real-time streaming and batch processing through HTTP V2 API and Batch API.

**Marketing Ecosystem**: Deep integrations with advertising platforms (Google Ads, Facebook Ads), attribution providers (AppsFlyer, Adjust), and marketing automation tools (Braze, Iterable) for complete customer journey tracking.

**Development Workflow**: Ampli CLI generates type-safe tracking code from schema definitions, supporting infrastructure-as-code approaches. Comprehensive SDK ecosystem with consistent APIs across platforms.

**Enterprise Features**: SAML SSO, SCIM provisioning, advanced permissions, data residency controls (US/EU), and privacy compliance tools (GDPR, CCPA).

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Core APIs**:
- HTTP V2 API (`/2/httpapi`): Primary event ingestion
- Batch API (`/batch`): Bulk event processing  
- Export API (`/api/2/export`): Raw data extraction
- Evaluation API (`/v1/vardata`): Feature flag evaluation
- Profile API: Real-time user profile access

**CLI Tools**:
- `ampli pull`: Generate type-safe tracking code
- `ampli status`: Validate implementation against schema
- `ampli push`: Update implementation status

**SDK Methods** (consistent across platforms):
- `track()`: Event logging
- `identify()`: User property management
- `flush()`: Force event transmission
- `variant()`: Feature flag evaluation

**Configuration Parameters**:
- `flushQueueSize`/`flushIntervalMillis`: Batching controls
- `serverZone`: Data residency (US/EU)
- `trackingOptions`: Privacy controls
- `sessionTimeout`: Session boundary definition

The platform represents a mature, enterprise-grade analytics ecosystem with sophisticated statistical capabilities, comprehensive integration options, and strong developer experience through type-safe SDKs and automated code generation.
