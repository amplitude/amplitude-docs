Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools for product analytics, feature experimentation, customer data management, and user engagement. The platform serves as an integrated ecosystem for understanding user behavior, optimizing product experiences, and driving growth through data-driven decision making.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem consists of several interconnected products that work together to provide end-to-end analytics and optimization capabilities:

**Amplitude Analytics** forms the core foundation, providing event tracking, user behavior analysis, and comprehensive reporting through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Revenue LTV, and Experiment Results. These charts enable deep behavioral analysis and business intelligence across the entire user journey.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced techniques, experiment theory, workflow management, and troubleshooting tools. It integrates seamlessly with analytics for measuring experiment impact and includes specialized SDKs for implementation across platforms.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user interactions in real-time, providing visual context to complement quantitative analytics data.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user engagement through contextual guidance, feedback collection, and onboarding experiences.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation through source and destination catalogs, audience management, and warehouse-native capabilities.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Collections** - Organizational structures that group related documentation content, each with specific routing patterns, templates, and navigation contexts

**Mount Points** - UUID-based identifiers that link collections to specific content hierarchies and enable content organization across the platform

**Navigation Titles (nav_title)** - Categorical identifiers that group collections under common navigation sections (analytics, experiment, data, apis, etc.)

**Blade** - Product-specific branding identifiers (e.g., "Amplitude Experiment", "Amplitude Session Replay") that provide context for feature attribution

**Route Patterns** - URL structures that define how content is organized and accessed, using slug-based hierarchies like `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/{slug}`

**Preview Targets** - Configuration for content preview functionality with permalink generation and refresh capabilities

**Date Behavior** - Content visibility rules that control when documentation becomes public (past) or remains private (future)

**Sites and Propagation** - Multi-language support configuration, particularly for English ('en') and Japanese ('jp') content localization

**Taxonomies** - Classification systems for organizing content, particularly integration categories for source and destination catalogs

**Structure Root** - Hierarchical organization indicator that determines parent-child relationships in content navigation

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The platform operates as a unified ecosystem where each component enhances the others:

**Analytics SDKs** provide instrumentation across multiple platforms including Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal, with the Ampli wrapper providing type-safe analytics implementation.

**APIs** enable programmatic access to Analytics, Experiment, and Guides and Surveys functionality, supporting custom integrations and automated workflows.

**Data Management** encompasses source catalog integrations for data ingestion, destination catalog for data activation, audience management for user segmentation, and PII handling for privacy compliance.

**Administrative Functions** include account management, billing and usage monitoring, single sign-on integration, and comprehensive user permission management.

**Partner Ecosystem** extends platform capabilities through third-party integrations and specialized use cases.

The platform supports comprehensive content management with revision control disabled across most collections, indicating a focus on current documentation rather than historical versioning. Multi-site support enables localization, with specific collections designated for Japanese translation and content propagation controls.

The documentation architecture reflects a mature, enterprise-grade platform with extensive SDK support, comprehensive API coverage, and sophisticated data management capabilities. The organizational structure facilitates both developer implementation and business user adoption through clear separation of technical documentation, user guides, administrative functions, and educational content.
