Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven decision making. The platform consists of several interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment (A/B testing), Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem is built around several core product areas that work together to provide end-to-end user analytics and optimization:

**Analytics Core**: The foundation includes event tracking, user segmentation, and behavioral analysis through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Personas, Stickiness, Compass, Data Tables, Impact Analysis, Revenue LTV, and Engagement Matrix. Legacy charts are maintained for backward compatibility.

**Experimentation Suite**: Amplitude Experiment provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced techniques, experiment theory, workflow management, results analysis, and troubleshooting tools. Web Experimentation offers client-side testing through a Visual Editor without requiring code changes.

**Data Management**: The CDP handles data ingestion through Sources, data activation through Destinations, audience creation and management, warehouse-native functionality, and PII handling. The platform supports both real-time and batch data processing.

**Developer Tools**: Comprehensive SDK support across platforms (Android, iOS, Browser, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, Unreal) with Ampli for type-safe analytics implementation. APIs are available for Analytics, Experiment, and Guides and Surveys.

**User Experience Tools**: Session Replay captures user interactions for qualitative analysis, while Guides and Surveys enable in-product user research and onboarding flows.

**Administrative Features**: Account management, billing and usage tracking, single sign-on integration, and administrative controls provide enterprise-grade governance.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events**: User actions tracked within applications, forming the foundation of all analytics and serving as the basis for segmentation and analysis.

**Properties**: Attributes associated with events (event properties) or users (user properties) that enable detailed segmentation and analysis.

**Cohorts/Audiences**: Groups of users defined by shared characteristics or behaviors, used for targeting in experiments and destinations.

**Segments**: Filtered subsets of users or events used in chart analysis to compare different populations or behaviors.

**Funnels**: Sequential analysis of user progression through defined steps, measuring conversion rates and identifying drop-off points.

**Retention**: Analysis of user return behavior over time, measuring how many users continue engaging with a product.

**Journeys**: Path analysis showing how users navigate through different events and states within an application.

**Feature Flags**: Configuration switches that control feature availability and behavior without requiring code deployments.

**Variants**: Different versions of features or experiences tested in experiments, with users bucketed into different variants for comparison.

**Destinations**: Third-party platforms and tools that receive data from Amplitude for activation and further analysis.

**Sources**: Systems and applications that send data into Amplitude for processing and analysis.

**Instrumentation**: The process of implementing tracking code to capture user events and properties.

## Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates extensively with the broader marketing and product technology stack:

**Data Integration**: The platform connects with hundreds of sources and destinations through its catalog, including major advertising platforms, CRMs, email marketing tools, and business intelligence platforms. Warehouse-native capabilities enable direct integration with data warehouses.

**Development Workflow**: SDKs support all major platforms and frameworks, with Ampli providing code generation for type-safe implementation. The platform integrates with CI/CD pipelines and supports both client-side and server-side tracking.

**Third-party Platforms**: Integration with CDPs like Segment and Tealium, tag managers like Google Tag Manager, and CMS platforms like WordPress and Shopify. The platform supports custom integrations through APIs and webhooks.

**Enterprise Systems**: Single sign-on integration with major identity providers, administrative APIs for programmatic management, and partner integrations for extended functionality.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Analytics API**: Provides endpoints for event ingestion, user lookup, cohort management, and data export with both HTTP and batch processing capabilities.

**Experiment APIs**: Enable programmatic flag management, user assignment, and results analysis with real-time evaluation capabilities.

**Guides and Surveys API**: Supports campaign management, response collection, and targeting configuration.

**Key Implementation Patterns**:
- Event tracking through `amplitude.track()` methods across all SDKs
- User identification via `amplitude.setUserId()` and device ID management
- Property setting through `amplitude.setUserProperties()` and event property parameters
- Experiment evaluation via `amplitude.variant()` and flag resolution
- Session management and replay capture through browser SDK extensions

**Route Structure**: Documentation is organized with clear URL patterns:
- `/analytics/` for core analytics features
- `/feature-experiment/` for experimentation tools
- `/sdks/` for development resources
- `/apis/` for API documentation
- `/data/` for CDP and data management
- `/admin/` for administrative functions

The platform emphasizes both ease of implementation for getting started and advanced capabilities for enterprise use cases, with comprehensive migration guides, troubleshooting resources, and multi-language support including Japanese localization.
