# Amplitude Partner Integration Platform

## Overview

Amplitude's Partner Integration Platform enables third-party services to build integrations with Amplitude's analytics ecosystem. The platform supports three primary integration types:

1. **Event Ingestion Integrations**: Allow partners to send event data into Amplitude
2. **Cohort Syncing Integrations**: Enable the export of Amplitude behavioral cohorts to partner platforms
3. **Event Streaming Integrations**: Facilitate real-time forwarding of Amplitude events to partner destinations

The Integration Portal serves as the central hub where partners can configure, test, and submit these integrations for inclusion in Amplitude's marketplace.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

### Integration Portal

The Integration Portal is the gateway for partners to create and manage integrations with Amplitude. Key aspects include:

- Access is granted by invitation after identifying at least three potential customers
- Partners can self-define integration tiles that appear in Amplitude's marketplace
- Provides a sandbox environment for testing integrations before submission
- Supports configuration of connection details, authentication methods, and user instructions
- Facilitates the submission and validation process for integrations

### Integration Types and Relationships

1. **Event Ingestion Integration**
   - Allows partners to send event data into Amplitude
   - Requires a unique `partner_id` parameter in event payloads
   - Uses Amplitude's HTTP v2 API for data transmission
   - Partners configure connection information and user setup instructions

2. **Cohort Syncing Integration**
   - Enables export of Amplitude behavioral cohorts to partner platforms
   - Supports two implementation models:
     - **List-based**: Creates and updates lists of users in partner systems
     - **Property-based**: Sets user properties in partner systems to indicate cohort membership
   - Requires implementation of specific API endpoints for cohort management

3. **Event Streaming Integration**
   - Forwards Amplitude events to partner destinations in real-time
   - Supports customizable payloads using Freemarker templates
   - Allows event filtering and property mapping
   - Partners define authentication methods and destination configuration

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Integration Portal**: Amplitude's platform for partners to create and manage integrations
- **Partner ID**: Unique identifier assigned to partners for tracking event sources
- **Behavioral Cohort**: A group of users defined by their actions or behaviors in Amplitude
- **List-based Cohort Integration**: Integration that creates and manages lists of users in partner systems
- **Property-based Cohort Integration**: Integration that sets user properties to indicate cohort membership
- **Freemarker Templates**: Templating system used to customize event streaming payloads
- **Integration Tile**: The visual representation and configuration of an integration in Amplitude's marketplace

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

### Event Ingestion Integration
- Uses Amplitude's HTTP v2 API
- Requires `partner_id` parameter in event payloads
- Example payload structure provided in documentation

### Cohort Syncing Integration
For list-based integrations, partners must implement:
- List creation endpoint
- Add users endpoint
- Remove users endpoint

For property-based integrations:
- User property update endpoint

Authentication typically uses Basic Authentication or API keys

### Event Streaming Integration
- Partners define destination endpoints to receive forwarded events
- Supports customizable payloads using Freemarker templates
- Includes rate limiting considerations
- Allows filtering of events based on event types

## Integration Ecosystem

The Amplitude Partner Integration Platform fits into a broader ecosystem where:

1. Partners gain visibility through Amplitude's marketplace
2. Amplitude users benefit from seamless data flow between platforms
3. Co-marketing opportunities exist for featured integrations
4. The platform enables bidirectional data flow:
   - Data into Amplitude (Event Ingestion)
   - Data out of Amplitude (Cohort Syncing and Event Streaming)

Partners must go through a validation process before integrations are published to the marketplace, ensuring quality and reliability for Amplitude's customers.
