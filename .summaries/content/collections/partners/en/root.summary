## Amplitude Partner Integration Platform

Amplitude provides a comprehensive Partner Integration Platform centered around the **Integration Portal**, which serves as the primary gateway for partners to build, configure, and manage integrations with Amplitude's analytics ecosystem. The platform supports three distinct integration types that enable bidirectional data flow and audience activation between Amplitude and partner platforms.

## Integration Types and Relationships

The platform supports three core integration patterns:

**Event Ingestion Integrations** enable partners to send behavioral data into Amplitude through the HTTP v2 API. These integrations appear as tiles on Amplitude's Sources page and utilize the `partner_id` parameter for proper attribution and tracking. Partners configure connection information, setup steps, and API key handling through the Developer Portal.

**Event Streaming Integrations** provide real-time event forwarding from Amplitude to partner platforms using Freemarker templating for payload customization. These destination tiles support comprehensive event filtering, user property mapping through MappedProperties and MappedFields, and flexible authentication methods. The system forwards both behavioral events and identify calls in real-time.

**Cohort Syncing Integrations** export Amplitude's behavioral cohorts to partner platforms via REST API, supporting two distinct patterns:
- **List-based integrations**: Create and manage user lists with dedicated endpoints for list creation, adding users, and removing users
- **Property-based integrations**: Set user traits or properties to indicate cohort membership status

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Integration Portal/Developer Portal**: Amplitude's self-service platform where partners configure integration tiles, set up authentication, define API endpoints, and submit integrations for review.

**Integration Catalog**: The marketplace where approved integrations are listed and made available to Amplitude customers.

**Partner ID**: A unique identifier parameter used in HTTP v2 API payloads to attribute events to specific partner integrations.

**Freemarker Templates**: Template engine used in Event Streaming integrations for dynamic payload generation and customization.

**MappedProperties/MappedFields**: Configuration objects that define how Amplitude user properties and event fields map to partner platform schemas.

**Cohort Sync Patterns**: 
- List-based: Manages discrete user lists with CRUD operations
- Property-based: Updates user attributes to reflect cohort membership

**Batch Processing**: Configurable batch sizes for cohort syncing with automatic retry mechanisms using exponential backoff.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Partner Integration Platform operates as a bridge layer within Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem. Event Ingestion integrations feed into Amplitude's core analytics engine, enriching behavioral datasets from partner platforms. Event Streaming integrations enable real-time activation by forwarding processed events and user segments to downstream marketing, personalization, and analytics tools.

Cohort Syncing represents the audience activation layer, where Amplitude's behavioral segmentation capabilities are exported to partner platforms for campaign targeting, personalization, and cross-platform user journey orchestration. The platform supports both real-time streaming and batch-based synchronization patterns to accommodate different partner technical architectures.

## Technical Implementation Details

**API Endpoints and Methods**:
- HTTP v2 API for event ingestion with partner_id parameter support
- REST API endpoints for cohort syncing (list creation, user addition/removal)
- Bulk API batching for efficient data transfer
- Configurable authentication methods including Basic Authentication, Bearer Token, and custom Authentication Headers

**Configuration Capabilities**:
- Custom field mapping and payload transformation
- Batch size configuration for optimal performance
- Error handling with specific status code management
- Rate limiting and retry logic implementation
- Template variables including $items and $list_id for dynamic content generation

**Integration Lifecycle**:
Partners access the Integration Portal with sandbox plans, configure integration tiles through self-service tools, test implementations using provided testing frameworks, and submit completed integrations for Amplitude Engineering team review before marketplace publication in the Integration Catalog.

The platform emphasizes developer experience with comprehensive testing capabilities, flexible authentication options, and detailed configuration tools that accommodate diverse partner technical requirements while maintaining consistent integration patterns across the ecosystem.
