## Amplitude Partner Integration Platform

Amplitude provides a comprehensive partner integration platform that enables third-party companies to build and manage data integrations through a centralized **Integration Portal**. The platform supports bidirectional data flow between Amplitude and partner systems, facilitating both data ingestion and data export capabilities across the analytics ecosystem.

## Integration Types and Relationships

The platform supports three primary integration patterns that work together to create a complete data ecosystem:

**Event Ingestion Integrations** serve as data sources, allowing partners to send behavioral event data into Amplitude via the HTTP v2 API. These integrations appear as tiles on Amplitude's Sources page and require a partner_id parameter for proper attribution and routing.

**Event Streaming Integrations** function as data destinations, enabling real-time forwarding of events and user properties from Amplitude to partner platforms. These integrations utilize Freemarker templating for payload customization and support advanced features like event filtering, user property mapping through MappedProperties and MappedFields, and identify forwarding.

**Cohort Syncing Integrations** export user segments from Amplitude to partner platforms using two distinct patterns: list-based integrations that create and manage user lists through dedicated API endpoints (list creation, add users, remove users), and property-based integrations that set user traits or properties directly on user profiles.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Integration Portal**: Amplitude's self-service partner gateway for building, configuring, and managing integrations before submission to the Integration Catalog.

**Integration Catalog**: The marketplace where approved integrations are listed and made available to Amplitude customers.

**Cohort Syncing**: The process of exporting user segments (cohorts) from Amplitude to partner platforms, supporting both full sync and incremental sync modes with configurable scheduling (hourly/daily).

**List-based vs Property-based Cohorts**: Two integration patterns where list-based creates discrete user lists on partner platforms, while property-based sets user attributes or traits directly on user profiles.

**Freemarker Templates**: Template engine used in Event Streaming integrations for dynamic payload generation and customization.

**MappedProperties/MappedFields**: Configuration objects that define how Amplitude user properties and event fields map to partner platform schemas.

**Partner_id**: Required parameter for Event Ingestion integrations that ensures proper attribution and data routing within Amplitude's system.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The partner integration platform operates within Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem by connecting the core behavioral analytics platform with external data sources and destinations. Event Ingestion integrations expand Amplitude's data collection capabilities by enabling partners to contribute behavioral data, while Event Streaming and Cohort Syncing integrations extend Amplitude's insights into activation and personalization workflows on partner platforms.

The platform supports authentication through multiple methods including Basic Authentication, Bearer Token, and custom Authentication Headers. It implements robust error handling with exponential backoff retry mechanisms and configurable rate limiting to ensure reliable data transmission.

## Technical Implementation Details

**API Endpoints**: Cohort syncing integrations utilize REST APIs with specific endpoints for list creation, adding users, and removing users. Event ingestion leverages Amplitude's HTTP v2 API with partner_id parameter requirements.

**Payload Customization**: Event Streaming integrations support extensive payload customization through Freemarker templates, with variables like $items, $list_id, amplitude_cohort_name, and user_id_field_amplitude for dynamic content generation.

**Batch Processing**: Cohort syncing operates with configurable batch sizes (default 1000 users) and supports concurrent processing with up to 4 threads for efficient data transfer.

**Configuration Management**: The Integration Portal provides self-service tools for configuring connection information, setup steps, custom field mapping, and integration tile appearance before submission to Amplitude's Engineering team for review and marketplace approval.
