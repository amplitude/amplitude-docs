# Amplitude Partner Integration Platform

## Product Overview

Amplitude's Partner Integration Platform enables third-party partners to build and manage integrations with Amplitude's analytics and customer data platform. The platform supports three primary integration types:

1. **Event Ingestion Integrations** - Allow partners to send event data into Amplitude
2. **Cohort Syncing Integrations** - Enable the export of Amplitude behavioral cohorts to partner platforms
3. **Event Streaming Integrations** - Facilitate real-time forwarding of events from Amplitude to partner destinations

The Integration Portal serves as the central hub where partners can configure, test, and submit these integrations for approval before they appear in Amplitude's marketplace.

## Product Relationships and Features

### Integration Portal

The Integration Portal is the gateway for all partner integration development. Key features include:

- Self-service configuration of integration tiles
- Integration testing environments
- Submission and approval workflow
- Access to Amplitude's sandbox plan for development

Access to the Integration Portal is granted by invitation after partners identify at least three potential mutual customers.

### Event Ingestion Integrations

These integrations allow partners to send event data to Amplitude:

- Utilize Amplitude's HTTP v2 API
- Require a `partner_id` parameter for tracking
- Include customizable setup instructions for end users
- Support project API key authentication

### Cohort Syncing Integrations

These integrations export Amplitude's behavioral cohorts to partner platforms in two forms:

1. **List-based Cohort Syncing**:
   - Creates and updates lists of users in the partner platform
   - Requires endpoints for list creation, user addition, and user removal
   - Supports batch processing with configurable batch sizes

2. **Property-based Cohort Syncing**:
   - Sets properties on user profiles in the partner platform
   - Typically uses a single endpoint for updating user properties

Both types support various authentication methods and custom field configurations.

### Event Streaming Integrations

These integrations forward events from Amplitude to partner destinations:

- Support real-time event forwarding
- Allow customizable payload structures using FreeMarker templates
- Enable event filtering and property mapping
- Include rate limiting considerations
- Support various authentication methods

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Behavioral Cohort**: A group of users defined by their actions or behaviors in Amplitude
- **List-based Cohort**: A cohort implementation where users are added to or removed from lists in the partner platform
- **Property-based Cohort**: A cohort implementation where properties are set on user profiles in the partner platform
- **Integration Tile**: The configurable UI component that appears in Amplitude's interface
- **FreeMarker Templates**: Templating system used to customize event streaming payloads
- **Partner_id**: Required parameter for tracking events sent through partner integrations
- **Slugify**: Process of converting cohort names into URL-friendly formats

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's Partner Integration Platform fits into the broader Amplitude ecosystem by:

1. Extending Amplitude's data collection capabilities through Event Ingestion integrations
2. Enabling activation of Amplitude insights in external tools through Cohort Syncing
3. Supporting real-time data workflows through Event Streaming

The platform connects Amplitude's core analytics capabilities with partner tools across the marketing, product, and data technology landscape.

## API Endpoints and Technical Details

### Event Ingestion
- Uses Amplitude's HTTP v2 API endpoint
- Requires `partner_id` parameter in all events
- Authentication via project API key

### Cohort Syncing
For list-based integrations:
- Endpoint for list creation
- Endpoint for adding users to lists
- Endpoint for removing users from lists

For property-based integrations:
- Single endpoint for updating user properties

### Event Streaming
- Configurable destination endpoints
- Support for custom headers and authentication
- Payload customization via FreeMarker templates
- Batch processing capabilities with configurable sizes

All integrations undergo a testing and validation process before being approved for the Amplitude marketplace.
