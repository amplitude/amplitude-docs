# Amplitude Partner Integration Platform

## Product Overview

Amplitude's Partner Integration Platform enables third-party partners to build and manage integrations with Amplitude's analytics and customer data platform. The platform supports three primary integration types:

1. **Event Ingestion Integrations** - Allow partners to send event data into Amplitude
2. **Cohort Syncing Integrations** - Enable the export of Amplitude behavioral cohorts to partner platforms
3. **Event Streaming Integrations** - Facilitate real-time forwarding of events from Amplitude to partner destinations

The Integration Portal serves as the central hub where partners can configure, test, and submit these integrations for inclusion in Amplitude's marketplace.

## Product Relationships and Features

### Integration Portal

The Integration Portal is the gateway for partners to create and manage all integration types. Key features include:

- Self-service configuration of integration tiles
- Testing capabilities in a sandbox environment
- Submission workflow for Amplitude approval
- Access to integration analytics and performance metrics

Access to the Integration Portal is invitation-based, requiring partners to demonstrate customer demand for their integration.

### Event Ingestion Integrations

These integrations allow partners to send event data to Amplitude:

- Utilize Amplitude's HTTP v2 API for event transmission
- Require a unique `partner_id` parameter for tracking and attribution
- Support customizable connection information and user instructions
- Include configurable source setup instructions for end users

### Cohort Syncing Integrations

These integrations export Amplitude's behavioral cohorts to partner platforms:

- Support two implementation models:
  - **List-based integrations**: Create and manage lists of users in the destination platform
  - **Property-based integrations**: Set user properties in the destination platform
- Handle authentication via Basic Auth, API Key, or OAuth
- Process cohort membership changes in batches
- Support scheduled syncs and real-time updates
- Include retry mechanisms for failed API calls

### Event Streaming Integrations

These integrations forward events from Amplitude to partner destinations in real-time:

- Support customizable event payloads using FreeMarker templates
- Allow event filtering based on event types
- Enable user property mapping between Amplitude and destination platforms
- Include rate limiting capabilities
- Support various authentication methods

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Behavioral Cohort**: A group of users defined by their actions or behaviors in Amplitude
- **List-based Cohort**: A cohort implementation where users are added to or removed from lists in the destination platform
- **Property-based Cohort**: A cohort implementation where user properties are set in the destination platform
- **Integration Tile**: The configurable UI component that appears in Amplitude's marketplace
- **FreeMarker Templates**: A templating system used to customize event payloads in Event Streaming integrations
- **Partner_id**: A unique identifier assigned to partners for tracking events sent to Amplitude
- **Slugify**: The process of converting a cohort name into a URL-friendly format

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's Partner Integration Platform fits into the broader Amplitude ecosystem by:

1. Enabling bidirectional data flow between Amplitude and partner platforms
2. Extending Amplitude's capabilities through specialized partner tools
3. Allowing customers to activate their Amplitude data across their tech stack
4. Creating a marketplace of pre-built integrations for Amplitude customers

The platform serves as both a data source (via Event Ingestion) and a data destination (via Cohort Syncing and Event Streaming) within a customer's overall data infrastructure.

## API Endpoints and Technical Details

### Event Ingestion Integration
- Uses Amplitude's HTTP v2 API endpoint
- Requires inclusion of `partner_id` parameter in event payloads
- Example payload structure provided in documentation

### Cohort Syncing Integration
- **List-based API endpoints**:
  - Create/update list endpoint
  - Add users to list endpoint
  - Remove users from list endpoint
- **Property-based API endpoints**:
  - Set user property endpoint
- Supports batch processing with configurable batch sizes
- Implements error classification and handling

### Event Streaming Integration
- Configurable payload structure using FreeMarker templates
- Supports various authentication methods (Basic Auth, API Key, OAuth)
- Includes rate limiting considerations
- Allows for event filtering and property mapping

All integrations undergo a validation and testing process before being approved for the Amplitude marketplace, ensuring quality and reliability for end users.
