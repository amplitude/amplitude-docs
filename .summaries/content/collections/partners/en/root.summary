## Amplitude Partner Integration Platform

Amplitude provides a comprehensive partner integration ecosystem through its Integration Portal, enabling third-party platforms to build and deploy integrations that facilitate bidirectional data flow with Amplitude's analytics platform. The platform supports three primary integration types: cohort syncing, event streaming, and event ingestion, each designed to address specific data synchronization needs between Amplitude and partner platforms.

## Product Relationships and Integration Types

The partner integration platform operates through a centralized **Integration Portal** that serves as the primary gateway for partners to create, configure, and manage their integrations. This portal connects to Amplitude's broader ecosystem through several key touchpoints:

**Cohort Syncing Integrations** enable the export of Amplitude's behavioral cohorts to partner platforms using two distinct patterns:
- **List-based cohort integration**: Creates and manages user lists on partner platforms through dedicated API endpoints (list creation, add users, remove users)
- **Property-based cohort integration**: Sets user traits or properties on partner platforms to indicate cohort membership

**Event Streaming Integrations** provide real-time forwarding of Amplitude events to partner platforms using Freemarker templates for payload customization, supporting selective event filtering and user property mapping.

**Event Ingestion Integrations** allow partners to send event data into Amplitude through the HTTP v2 API, appearing as data sources in Amplitude's Sources page.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Integration Portal**: Amplitude's self-service platform where partners configure integration tiles, upload logos, and manage integration settings before submission to the Integration Catalog.

**Integration Catalog**: The public marketplace where approved integrations are deployed and made available to Amplitude customers with Plus or Greater plans.

**Destinations Page**: The interface within Amplitude where customers configure and manage outbound data integrations (cohort syncing and event streaming).

**Sources Page**: The interface where customers configure inbound data integrations (event ingestion).

**Cohort Sync**: The automated process of exporting user cohorts from Amplitude to partner platforms, supporting both full sync and incremental sync modes with configurable scheduling (hourly/daily).

**Freemarker Templates**: Template engine used for customizing event streaming payloads, enabling dynamic content generation and field mapping.

**MappedProperties/MappedFields**: Configuration objects that define how Amplitude user properties and event fields are transformed and forwarded to partner platforms.

## Technical Implementation Details

### API Endpoints and Configuration
Cohort syncing integrations utilize three primary endpoint types:
- **List Creation Endpoint**: Creates new user lists on partner platforms
- **Add Users Endpoint**: Adds users to existing cohorts/lists
- **Remove Users Endpoint**: Removes users from cohorts/lists

### Authentication Methods
The platform supports multiple authentication schemes:
- **Basic Authentication**: Username/password or API key-based authentication
- **Bearer Token**: Token-based authentication for OAuth implementations
- **Authentication Header**: Custom header-based authentication methods

### Payload Customization
Partners can customize data payloads using several templating variables:
- **$items**: Contains batched user data for cohort operations
- **$list_id**: Placeholder for cohort/list identifiers
- **$amplitude_cohort_name**: Dynamic cohort name variable with slugify support
- **item_template**: Defines the structure for individual user records

### Batch Processing and Error Handling
The system implements robust data processing capabilities:
- Default batch size of 1000 users for cohort syncing operations
- Concurrent processing using 4 threads for improved performance
- Exponential backoff retry logic for handling API failures
- Comprehensive error status code handling and reporting

### Testing and Validation
The platform provides multiple testing mechanisms:
- CSV upload testing for cohort sync validation
- Endpoint testing for API connectivity verification
- Partner_id parameter validation for event ingestion
- "Release Internally" option for controlled testing before public deployment

## Ecosystem Integration

The partner integration platform integrates seamlessly with Amplitude's core analytics infrastructure, enabling customers to create comprehensive data workflows. Cohort destinations allow behavioral segments created in Amplitude to be automatically synchronized with marketing automation platforms, CRM systems, and advertising networks. Event streaming destinations provide real-time event forwarding for immediate action triggering in partner systems. Event ingestion sources consolidate data from multiple touchpoints into Amplitude's unified analytics platform.

The platform supports co-marketing opportunities between Amplitude and partners, with approved integrations receiving visibility in the Integration Catalog and potential joint marketing initiatives. All integrations require Amplitude Plus or Greater plans, ensuring enterprise-grade reliability and support for the partner ecosystem.
