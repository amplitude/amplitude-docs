## Amplitude Partner Integration Platform

Amplitude provides a comprehensive partner integration ecosystem that enables third-party platforms to seamlessly connect with Amplitude's behavioral analytics and user cohort data through three primary integration types: cohort syncing, event streaming, and event ingestion.

## Integration Types and Relationships

The platform supports three distinct integration patterns that serve different data flow directions:

**Cohort Syncing Integrations** export user cohorts from Amplitude to partner platforms using two architectural patterns:
- **List-based cohorts** create and manage user lists on partner platforms through dedicated endpoints (list creation, add users, remove users)
- **Property-based cohorts** set user traits or properties directly on individual user profiles

**Event Streaming Integrations** forward real-time behavioral events from Amplitude to partner destinations using Freemarker templates for payload customization and selective property forwarding.

**Event Ingestion Integrations** enable partners to send event data into Amplitude through the HTTP v2 API with Project API Key authentication and partner_id parameter validation.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Integration Portal**: Amplitude's self-service partner gateway for creating, configuring, and managing integrations before submission to the Integration Catalog.

**Integration Catalog**: The public marketplace where approved partner integrations are deployed and made available to Amplitude customers.

**Integration Tiles**: Visual configuration interfaces that appear on Amplitude's Sources and Destinations pages, allowing users to set up and manage partner connections.

**Cohort Sync Variables**:
- `$items`: Template variable containing user data for batch operations
- `$list_id`: Placeholder for partner platform list identifiers
- `$amplitude_cohort_name`: Variable containing the cohort name from Amplitude
- `user_id_field_amplitude`: Field mapping for user identifier synchronization

**Event Streaming Components**:
- **MappedProperties**: User property mapping configuration
- **MappedFields**: Custom field mapping between Amplitude and partner schemas
- **Freemarker templates**: Template engine for payload customization and transformation

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The partner platform integrates with Amplitude's broader ecosystem through multiple touchpoints:

- **Sources Page**: Where event ingestion integrations appear for data input configuration
- **Destinations Page**: Where cohort syncing and event streaming integrations are configured for data export
- **Developer Portal**: Partner interface for integration development and testing
- **Plus or Greater Amplitude Plans**: Required subscription level for accessing partner integrations

## Technical Implementation Details

**API Endpoints and Configuration**:
- List creation endpoints for establishing cohort containers
- Add/remove user endpoints for cohort membership management
- HTTP v2 API for event ingestion with partner_id validation
- REST API calls with configurable authentication methods

**Authentication Methods**:
- Basic Authentication with API keys
- Bearer Token authentication
- Custom Authentication Headers
- Project API Key for event ingestion

**Data Processing Features**:
- Configurable batch sizes (default 1000 users for cohort sync)
- Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff
- 4 concurrent threads for cohort synchronization
- Hourly and daily sync scheduling options
- Full sync and incremental sync capabilities

**Payload Customization**:
- Custom field mapping and transformation
- Slugify functionality for cohort name formatting
- Item template replacement for dynamic content
- Event filtering and selective property forwarding
- Rate limiting and throttling controls

The platform requires Org ID configuration and supports co-marketing opportunities for approved partners, creating a comprehensive ecosystem for behavioral data integration and user cohort management across partner platforms.
