## Amplitude Partner Integration Platform

Amplitude provides a comprehensive Partner Integration Platform through its Integration Portal, enabling third-party partners to build and manage integrations that connect with Amplitude's analytics ecosystem. The platform supports bidirectional data flow and cohort syncing capabilities across three primary integration types.

## Integration Types and Relationships

The platform supports three distinct integration patterns that work together to create a complete data ecosystem:

**Event Ingestion Integrations** enable partners to send behavioral event data into Amplitude's analytics platform. These integrations appear as Data Source tiles in Amplitude's Sources page and utilize the HTTP v2 API with partner_id parameters for proper attribution and tracking.

**Event Streaming Integrations** provide real-time event forwarding from Amplitude to partner platforms using Freemarker templates for payload customization. These appear as Data Destination tiles and support sophisticated event filtering, user property mapping, and custom authentication methods.

**Cohort Syncing Integrations** export Amplitude's behavioral cohorts to partner platforms through two distinct patterns: list-based integrations that create and manage user lists, and property-based integrations that set user traits and properties on individual user profiles.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Integration Portal**: Amplitude's partner gateway and self-service platform for building, configuring, and managing integrations before submission to the Integration Catalog.

**Integration Catalog**: Amplitude's marketplace where approved partner integrations are listed and made available to customers.

**Cohort Syncing Patterns**:
- **List-based cohort integration**: Creates and manages user lists on partner platforms using list creation, add users, and remove users API endpoints
- **Property-based cohort integration**: Sets user traits or properties on individual user profiles to indicate cohort membership

**Freemarker Templates**: Template engine used in Event Streaming integrations for dynamic payload customization and event body configuration.

**MappedProperties/MappedFields**: Configuration objects that define how Amplitude user properties and event fields map to partner platform schemas.

**Partner_id Parameter**: Special identifier included in HTTP v2 API payloads to properly attribute events to specific partner integrations.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Event Ingestion**: Utilizes Amplitude's HTTP v2 API with partner_id parameters embedded in event payloads for proper source attribution.

**Cohort Syncing APIs** include three primary endpoint types:
- List creation endpoints for establishing new cohort lists
- Add users endpoints for bulk user additions with configurable batch sizes
- Remove users endpoints for user removal from cohorts

**Event Streaming**: Supports REST API calls with customizable headers, authentication methods (Bearer Token, Basic Authentication, Custom Headers), and Freemarker-templated request bodies.

**Authentication Methods**: The platform supports multiple authentication patterns including basic authentication with api_key, bearer tokens, and custom header configurations.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The Partner Integration Platform serves as Amplitude's extensibility layer, enabling the analytics platform to integrate with the broader marketing technology and customer data ecosystem. Event Ingestion integrations expand Amplitude's data collection capabilities beyond its native SDKs, while Event Streaming integrations enable real-time activation of Amplitude insights across partner platforms.

Cohort syncing creates a bridge between Amplitude's behavioral analytics and partner platforms' activation capabilities, supporting both bulk list management workflows and individual user property enrichment patterns. The platform includes sophisticated error handling, retry mechanisms with exponential backoff, and comprehensive testing tools including mock payload validation.

The Integration Portal provides a complete partner onboarding workflow, from initial configuration through Amplitude Engineering team review and final marketplace listing, creating a scalable ecosystem for third-party integrations while maintaining quality and security standards.
