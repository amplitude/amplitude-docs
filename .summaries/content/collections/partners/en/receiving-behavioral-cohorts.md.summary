## Summary
This documentation details how Amplitude syncs behavioral cohorts to partner platforms through REST API calls, supporting both list-based integrations (creating/updating lists of users) and property-based integrations (setting user properties). It covers authentication, batch processing, sync scheduling, retry mechanisms, and API endpoints for both integration types.
