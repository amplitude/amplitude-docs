## Summary
This documentation describes Amplitude's behavioral cohort syncing system that exports user cohorts to partner platforms via REST API using two integration patterns: list-based (creating/updating user lists) and property-based (setting user traits/properties), with basic authentication, configurable batching (default 1000 users), and automatic retry logic with exponential backoff.
