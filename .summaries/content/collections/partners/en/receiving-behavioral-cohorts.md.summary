## Summary
This documentation details how Amplitude syncs behavioral cohorts to partner platforms through REST API calls, supporting both list-based integrations (creating/updating lists of users) and property-based integrations (setting user properties). It covers authentication, sync considerations, API endpoints for both integration types, and testing recommendations.
