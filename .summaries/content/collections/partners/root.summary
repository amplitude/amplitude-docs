# Amplitude Partner Integration Platform

## Overview

Amplitude's Partner Integration Platform enables third-party services to build integrations with Amplitude's analytics ecosystem. The platform supports three primary integration types that facilitate data flow between Amplitude and partner systems:

1. **Event Ingestion Integrations** - Allow partners to send event data into Amplitude
2. **Cohort Syncing Integrations** - Enable the export of Amplitude behavioral cohorts to partner platforms
3. **Event Streaming Integrations** - Facilitate real-time forwarding of Amplitude events to partner destinations

These integrations create a comprehensive data ecosystem where analytics data can flow bidirectionally between Amplitude and partner platforms, enhancing the value of both systems for mutual customers.

## Product Relationships and Features

### Integration Portal

The Integration Portal serves as the central hub for partners to develop, configure, test, and submit integrations:

- Access is invitation-based, requiring identification of at least three potential mutual customers
- Provides a sandbox environment for testing before submission to production
- Enables self-configuration of integration tiles that appear in Amplitude's marketplace
- Supports detailed configuration of connection parameters, authentication methods, and user instructions
- Manages the submission and validation workflow for new integrations

### Integration Types

1. **Event Ingestion Integration**
   - Enables partners to send event data to Amplitude's analytics platform
   - Requires a unique `partner_id` parameter in all event payloads for source tracking
   - Utilizes Amplitude's HTTP v2 API for data transmission
   - Partners configure connection details and provide setup instructions for users

2. **Cohort Syncing Integration**
   - Exports Amplitude behavioral cohorts to partner platforms
   - Supports two implementation models:
     - **List-based**: Creates and manages lists of users in partner systems
     - **Property-based**: Sets user properties in partner systems to indicate cohort membership
   - Requires implementation of specific API endpoints to handle cohort data
   - Enables targeted marketing, personalization, and segmentation in partner platforms

3. **Event Streaming Integration**
   - Forwards Amplitude events to partner destinations in real-time
   - Supports customizable payloads using Freemarker templates
   - Allows event filtering and property mapping
   - Partners define authentication methods and destination configuration
   - Enables real-time reactions to user behavior across integrated systems

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Integration Portal**: Amplitude's platform for partners to create and manage integrations
- **Partner ID**: Unique identifier assigned to partners for tracking event sources
- **Behavioral Cohort**: A group of users defined by their actions or behaviors in Amplitude
- **List-based Cohort Integration**: Integration that creates and manages lists of users in partner systems
- **Property-based Cohort Integration**: Integration that sets user properties to indicate cohort membership
- **Freemarker Templates**: Templating system used to customize event streaming payloads
- **Integration Tile**: The visual representation and configuration of an integration in Amplitude's marketplace
- **Sandbox Environment**: Testing environment for partners to validate integrations before submission

## Product Ecosystem

The Amplitude Partner Integration Platform sits at the center of a data ecosystem that connects analytics data with various marketing, product, and operational tools:

1. **Data Flow Architecture**:
   - **Inbound**: Event data flows from partner platforms into Amplitude (Event Ingestion)
   - **Outbound**: User segments and event data flow from Amplitude to partner platforms (Cohort Syncing and Event Streaming)

2. **Marketplace Visibility**:
   - Partners gain exposure through Amplitude's integration marketplace
   - Integrations are categorized and searchable by Amplitude customers
   - Featured integrations receive additional visibility

3. **Validation Process**:
   - All integrations undergo technical validation before publication
   - Partners must demonstrate real customer use cases
   - Quality standards ensure reliability for Amplitude's customer base

4. **Co-marketing Opportunities**:
   - Joint marketing initiatives for featured integrations
   - Case studies highlighting successful integration use cases

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

### Event Ingestion Integration
- Uses Amplitude's HTTP v2 API endpoint
- Requires `partner_id` parameter in event payloads
- Example payload structure:
  ```json
  {
    "api_key": "AMPLITUDE_API_KEY",
    "events": [{
      "user_id": "USER_ID",
      "event_type": "EVENT_TYPE",
      "partner_id": "PARTNER_ID"
    }]
  }
  ```

### Cohort Syncing Integration
For list-based integrations, partners must implement:
- List creation endpoint
- Add users endpoint
- Remove users endpoint

For property-based integrations:
- User property update endpoint

Authentication typically uses Basic Authentication or API keys.

### Event Streaming Integration
- Partners define destination endpoints to receive forwarded events
- Supports customizable payloads using Freemarker templates
- Includes rate limiting considerations
- Allows filtering of events based on event types

The platform provides a comprehensive framework for bidirectional data integration, enabling partners to enhance their offerings with Amplitude's analytics capabilities while extending Amplitude's ecosystem with specialized partner functionality.
