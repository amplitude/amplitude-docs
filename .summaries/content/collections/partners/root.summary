# Amplitude Partner Integration Platform

## Product Overview

Amplitude's Partner Integration Platform enables third-party partners to build, manage, and publish integrations with Amplitude's analytics platform. The platform supports three primary integration types:

1. **Event Ingestion Integrations** - Allow partners to send event data into Amplitude
2. **Cohort Syncing Integrations** - Enable partners to receive behavioral cohorts from Amplitude
3. **Event Streaming Integrations** - Facilitate real-time forwarding of events from Amplitude to partner platforms

Partners use the Integration Portal to configure these integrations, which then appear as tiles in Amplitude's marketplace for customers to discover and implement.

## Product Relationships and Features

### Integration Portal

The Integration Portal serves as the central hub where partners can:
- Create and manage integration configurations
- Self-define integration tiles for Amplitude's marketplace
- Test integrations before submission
- Submit integrations for Amplitude's review
- Access a partner sandbox environment

Access to the Integration Portal requires an invitation, typically granted after partners identify at least three potential mutual customers.

### Integration Types

#### Event Ingestion Integration
- Enables partners to send event data to Amplitude
- Requires implementation of Amplitude's HTTP v2 API
- Mandates inclusion of a `partner_id` parameter in events
- Appears on Amplitude's Sources page for customer implementation
- Supports project-level configuration

#### Cohort Syncing Integration
- Allows Amplitude to send behavioral cohort data to partner platforms
- Supports two implementation models:
  - **List-based integration**: Creates and updates lists of users in partner systems
  - **Property-based integration**: Sets user properties in partner systems to indicate cohort membership
- Requires partners to implement specific API endpoints for cohort operations
- Handles authentication, batch processing, and error management

#### Event Streaming Integration
- Forwards events in real-time from Amplitude to partner destinations
- Supports customizable event filtering and property mapping
- Uses FreeMarker templates for payload configuration
- Includes rate limiting considerations
- Requires specific authentication methods (Basic Auth, API Key, OAuth 2.0)

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Integration Portal**: Platform for partners to create and manage integrations
- **Partner_id**: Identifier parameter required in events sent to Amplitude
- **Behavioral Cohorts**: User groups defined by their actions or behaviors in Amplitude
- **List-based Cohort**: Integration model where cohorts are synced as user lists
- **Property-based Cohort**: Integration model where cohort membership is indicated via user properties
- **FreeMarker Templates**: Templating system for configuring event streaming payloads
- **Integration Tile**: Visual representation and configuration interface in Amplitude's marketplace
- **Sources Page**: Customer interface for implementing event ingestion integrations
- **Destinations Page**: Customer interface for implementing event streaming integrations

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's Partner Integration Platform serves as a connector within the broader analytics ecosystem by:

1. Enabling bidirectional data flow between Amplitude and partner platforms
2. Allowing customers to combine Amplitude's analytics with specialized partner tools
3. Creating a marketplace of integrations that extend Amplitude's core functionality
4. Supporting the entire customer data lifecycle from collection to activation

The platform bridges Amplitude's analytics capabilities with partner-specific functionalities to create comprehensive solutions for mutual customers.

## API Endpoints and Technical Details

### Event Ingestion Integration
- Utilizes Amplitude's HTTP v2 API endpoint
- Requires `partner_id` parameter in all events
- Events must conform to Amplitude's event schema

### Cohort Syncing Integration
Partners must implement these API endpoints:
- **List Creation**: Endpoint to create a new list in the partner system
- **Add Users**: Endpoint to add users to a list
- **Remove Users**: Endpoint to remove users from a list

For property-based integrations:
- Endpoint to set user properties indicating cohort membership

### Event Streaming Integration
- Supports authentication methods:
  - Basic Authentication
  - API Key Authentication
  - OAuth 2.0
- Uses FreeMarker templates for payload configuration
- Implements rate limiting (typically 10 requests per second)
- Supports event filtering and property mapping

Amplitude handles retry logic, batch processing, and error management for all integration types, with specific error classification and handling procedures documented for partners.
