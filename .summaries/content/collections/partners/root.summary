## Amplitude Partner Integration Platform

Amplitude's Partner Integration Platform is a comprehensive ecosystem that enables third-party partners to build, deploy, and manage integrations with Amplitude's behavioral analytics platform. The platform facilitates bidirectional data exchange through three distinct integration patterns, supporting everything from raw event ingestion to sophisticated audience activation workflows.

## Integration Architecture and Relationships

The platform operates through three complementary integration types that form a complete data lifecycle:

**Event Ingestion Integrations** serve as data entry points, allowing partners to funnel behavioral data into Amplitude's analytics engine via the HTTP v2 API. These integrations manifest as source tiles within Amplitude's interface and require the `partner_id` parameter for proper event attribution. Partners configure connection parameters, authentication methods, and setup workflows through the self-service Developer Portal.

**Event Streaming Integrations** provide real-time data activation by forwarding processed events from Amplitude to partner platforms. These destination integrations leverage Freemarker templating for dynamic payload generation and support comprehensive event filtering, user property mapping through MappedProperties and MappedFields configurations, and flexible authentication schemes. The system handles both behavioral events and user identification calls in real-time.

**Cohort Syncing Integrations** complete the activation loop by exporting Amplitude's behavioral audience segments to partner platforms. The system supports two architectural patterns:
- **List-based integrations**: Manage discrete user collections with dedicated REST endpoints for list creation, user addition, and removal operations
- **Property-based integrations**: Update user attributes or traits to reflect cohort membership status

## Core Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Integration Portal/Developer Portal**: Amplitude's self-service configuration platform where partners define integration tiles, configure authentication, specify API endpoints, and manage the integration lifecycle from development through marketplace submission.

**Integration Catalog**: The public marketplace where approved integrations are published and made discoverable to Amplitude customers.

**Partner ID**: A unique identifier parameter embedded in HTTP v2 API payloads that enables proper event attribution and tracking for partner-sourced data.

**Freemarker Templates**: The templating engine powering Event Streaming integrations, enabling dynamic payload construction and customization based on Amplitude event data.

**MappedProperties/MappedFields**: Configuration objects that define the schema mapping between Amplitude's data model and partner platform field structures, enabling seamless data transformation.

**Cohort Sync Patterns**:
- **List-based**: Maintains discrete user collections with full CRUD operation support
- **Property-based**: Updates individual user attributes to indicate cohort membership

**Batch Processing**: Configurable batching mechanisms for cohort synchronization with automatic retry logic using exponential backoff strategies.

## Ecosystem Integration and Data Flow

The Partner Integration Platform functions as the connectivity layer within Amplitude's analytics ecosystem. Event Ingestion integrations feed behavioral data into Amplitude's core analytics engine, enriching customer datasets with cross-platform user interactions. This data undergoes Amplitude's behavioral analysis, segmentation, and cohort generation processes.

Event Streaming integrations enable real-time activation by forwarding processed events and user segments to downstream systems including marketing automation platforms, personalization engines, and external analytics tools. This creates closed-loop activation workflows where behavioral insights immediately influence customer experiences.

Cohort Syncing represents the audience activation tier, where Amplitude's sophisticated behavioral segmentation capabilities are exported to partner platforms for campaign targeting, personalization rule engines, and cross-platform user journey orchestration. The platform accommodates both real-time streaming and batch synchronization patterns to match diverse partner technical architectures.

## Technical Implementation Framework

**API Endpoints and Integration Methods**:
- HTTP v2 API for event ingestion with mandatory partner_id parameter support
- REST API endpoints for cohort management (list creation, user addition/removal operations)
- Bulk API batching capabilities for high-volume data transfer optimization
- Multiple authentication schemes including Basic Authentication, Bearer Token, and custom Authentication Headers

**Configuration and Customization Capabilities**:
- Dynamic field mapping and payload transformation through Freemarker templates
- Configurable batch sizes for performance optimization across different partner infrastructures
- Comprehensive error handling with specific HTTP status code management
- Built-in rate limiting and retry logic with exponential backoff
- Template variables including `$items` and `$list_id` for dynamic content generation
- Event filtering and user property mapping for precise data control

**Integration Development Lifecycle**:
The platform provides a complete development-to-production workflow: partners access the Integration Portal with sandbox environments, configure integration tiles through self-service tools, implement and test integrations using provided testing frameworks, and submit completed integrations for Amplitude Engineering team review. Upon approval, integrations are published to the Integration Catalog for customer discovery and activation.

The platform prioritizes developer experience through comprehensive testing capabilities, flexible authentication options, detailed configuration tools, and standardized integration patterns that accommodate diverse partner technical requirements while maintaining consistency across the ecosystem.
