## Amplitude Partner Integration Platform

Amplitude's Partner Integration Platform is a comprehensive ecosystem that enables third-party partners to build, manage, and deploy integrations with Amplitude's analytics platform through a self-service Integration Portal. The platform facilitates bidirectional data flow and cohort synchronization across multiple integration patterns, creating a bridge between Amplitude's behavioral analytics capabilities and the broader marketing technology stack.

## Integration Architecture and Relationships

The platform operates through three interconnected integration types that form a complete data ecosystem. **Event Ingestion Integrations** serve as data input mechanisms, allowing partners to funnel behavioral event data into Amplitude's analytics engine through the HTTP v2 API with specialized partner_id attribution. These integrations surface as Data Source tiles within Amplitude's Sources interface, expanding data collection capabilities beyond native SDKs.

**Event Streaming Integrations** provide the output layer, enabling real-time event forwarding from Amplitude to partner platforms. These integrations appear as Data Destination tiles and leverage Freemarker templating for dynamic payload customization, supporting sophisticated event filtering, user property mapping, and flexible authentication schemes.

**Cohort Syncing Integrations** create the activation bridge, exporting Amplitude's behavioral cohorts to partner platforms through two distinct architectural patterns: list-based integrations for bulk user list management and property-based integrations for individual user profile enrichment.

## Core Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Integration Portal** functions as the partner gateway and self-service development environment where integrations are built, configured, and tested before marketplace submission. The **Integration Catalog** serves as Amplitude's public marketplace where approved integrations become available to customers.

**Cohort Syncing Patterns** operate through two distinct methodologies:
- **List-based cohort integration**: Manages user collections through list creation, user addition, and user removal API endpoints with configurable batch processing
- **Property-based cohort integration**: Sets individual user traits or properties to indicate cohort membership status

**Freemarker Templates** provide the templating engine for Event Streaming integrations, enabling dynamic payload construction and event body customization. **MappedProperties/MappedFields** serve as configuration objects that define schema mapping between Amplitude user properties/event fields and partner platform data structures.

The **partner_id parameter** acts as a special identifier embedded in HTTP v2 API payloads to ensure proper event attribution to specific partner integrations within Amplitude's analytics platform.

## API Endpoints and Implementation Patterns

Event Ingestion leverages Amplitude's **HTTP v2 API** with embedded partner_id parameters for source attribution and tracking. Cohort Syncing implementations utilize three primary endpoint categories: list creation endpoints for establishing new cohort containers, add users endpoints supporting bulk user additions with configurable batch sizes, and remove users endpoints for cohort membership management.

Event Streaming supports REST API calls with customizable headers and multiple authentication methods including **Bearer Token authentication**, **Basic Authentication**, and **Custom Header configurations**. Request bodies utilize Freemarker templating for dynamic content generation.

Authentication patterns span basic authentication with api_key parameters, bearer token implementations, and custom header configurations, providing flexibility for diverse partner platform requirements.

## Product Ecosystem Integration and Workflow

The Partner Integration Platform functions as Amplitude's primary extensibility layer, connecting the analytics platform to the broader customer data and marketing technology ecosystem. Event Ingestion integrations expand Amplitude's data collection surface area, while Event Streaming integrations enable real-time insight activation across partner platforms.

The platform includes comprehensive error handling mechanisms, retry logic with exponential backoff strategies, and extensive testing capabilities including mock payload validation. The Integration Portal provides end-to-end partner onboarding workflows, from initial configuration through Amplitude Engineering team review processes to final marketplace publication.

This architecture creates a scalable partner ecosystem while maintaining quality and security standards through controlled review processes. The platform supports both bulk data management workflows and individual user-level operations, enabling partners to choose integration patterns that align with their platform capabilities and customer use cases.
