## Amplitude Partner Integration Platform

Amplitude operates a comprehensive partner integration ecosystem that enables third-party platforms to bidirectionally exchange behavioral analytics data and user cohorts through three core integration patterns: cohort syncing, event streaming, and event ingestion.

## Integration Architecture and Relationships

The platform orchestrates data flow through three distinct integration types that serve complementary purposes in the analytics ecosystem:

**Cohort Syncing Integrations** facilitate the export of user segments from Amplitude to partner platforms through two architectural approaches:
- **List-based cohorts** establish and maintain user collections on partner platforms via dedicated API endpoints for list creation, user addition, and user removal operations
- **Property-based cohorts** directly modify user attributes or traits on individual user profiles within partner systems

**Event Streaming Integrations** enable real-time forwarding of behavioral events from Amplitude to downstream destinations, utilizing Freemarker templating for payload transformation and selective property transmission.

**Event Ingestion Integrations** allow partner platforms to transmit event data into Amplitude's analytics pipeline through the HTTP v2 API, authenticated via Project API Keys with partner_id parameter validation.

## Core Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Integration Portal**: Amplitude's self-service partner development environment for creating, configuring, and testing integrations prior to catalog submission.

**Integration Catalog**: The public marketplace hosting approved partner integrations accessible to Amplitude customers.

**Integration Tiles**: User interface components displayed on Amplitude's Sources and Destinations pages, providing configuration interfaces for partner connections.

**Cohort Synchronization Variables**:
- `$items`: Template variable containing batched user data for bulk operations
- `$list_id`: Dynamic placeholder for partner platform list identifiers
- `$amplitude_cohort_name`: Variable containing source cohort nomenclature
- `user_id_field_amplitude`: Field mapping configuration for user identifier alignment

**Event Streaming Components**:
- **MappedProperties**: Configuration layer for user property field mapping
- **MappedFields**: Custom schema mapping between Amplitude and partner data structures
- **Freemarker templates**: Template engine enabling payload customization and data transformation

## Ecosystem Integration and Platform Positioning

The partner integration platform operates as a central hub within Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem:

- **Sources Page**: Houses event ingestion integrations for inbound data configuration
- **Destinations Page**: Contains cohort syncing and event streaming integrations for outbound data distribution
- **Developer Portal**: Partner-facing interface for integration development, testing, and management
- **Plus or Greater Amplitude Plans**: Subscription tier requirement for accessing partner integration functionality

## Technical Implementation and API Specifications

**API Endpoints and Operations**:
- List creation endpoints for establishing cohort containers on partner platforms
- User management endpoints for cohort membership addition and removal
- HTTP v2 API integration for event ingestion with partner_id validation
- RESTful API architecture with configurable authentication mechanisms

**Authentication Framework**:
- Basic Authentication utilizing API key credentials
- Bearer Token authentication for OAuth-based connections
- Custom Authentication Headers for proprietary authentication schemes
- Project API Key authentication for event ingestion workflows

**Data Processing and Performance Optimization**:
- Configurable batch processing with 1000-user default batch sizes for cohort synchronization
- Automatic retry mechanisms with exponential backoff algorithms
- 4 concurrent processing threads for cohort synchronization operations
- Flexible scheduling options supporting hourly and daily sync intervals
- Full synchronization and incremental sync capabilities for data consistency

**Payload Transformation and Customization**:
- Dynamic field mapping and data transformation capabilities
- Slugify functionality for cohort name standardization and formatting
- Item template replacement enabling dynamic content generation
- Event filtering mechanisms for selective property forwarding
- Rate limiting and throttling controls for API consumption management

The platform requires Org ID configuration for proper tenant isolation and supports co-marketing opportunities for approved partners, establishing a comprehensive ecosystem for behavioral data integration and user cohort management across diverse partner platforms within the broader analytics and marketing technology landscape.
