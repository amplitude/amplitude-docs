# Amplitude Partner Integration Platform

## Product Overview

Amplitude's Partner Integration Platform enables third-party partners to build and manage integrations with Amplitude's analytics and customer data platform. The platform supports three primary integration types:

1. **Event Ingestion Integrations** - Allow partners to send event data into Amplitude
2. **Cohort Syncing Integrations** - Enable the export of Amplitude behavioral cohorts to partner platforms
3. **Event Streaming Integrations** - Facilitate real-time forwarding of events from Amplitude to partner destinations

Partners use the Integration Portal to configure, test, and submit these integrations for approval before they appear in Amplitude's marketplace.

## Product Relationships and Features

### Integration Portal

The Integration Portal serves as the central hub for all partner integration development with features including:

- Self-service configuration of integration tiles
- Integration testing environments
- Submission and approval workflow
- Access to Amplitude's sandbox plan for development

Access requires an invitation after partners identify at least three potential mutual customers.

### Event Ingestion Integrations

These integrations send event data to Amplitude by:
- Using Amplitude's HTTP v2 API
- Including a required `partner_id` parameter for tracking
- Providing customizable setup instructions for end users
- Supporting project API key authentication

### Cohort Syncing Integrations

These integrations export Amplitude's behavioral cohorts to partner platforms in two forms:

1. **List-based Cohort Syncing**:
   - Creates and updates lists of users in the partner platform
   - Requires endpoints for list creation, user addition, and user removal
   - Supports batch processing with configurable batch sizes

2. **Property-based Cohort Syncing**:
   - Sets properties on user profiles in the partner platform
   - Typically uses a single endpoint for updating user properties

Both types support various authentication methods and custom field configurations.

### Event Streaming Integrations

These integrations forward events from Amplitude to partner destinations with capabilities for:
- Real-time event forwarding
- Customizable payload structures using FreeMarker templates
- Event filtering and property mapping
- Rate limiting considerations
- Various authentication methods

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Behavioral Cohort**: A group of users defined by their actions or behaviors in Amplitude
- **List-based Cohort**: A cohort implementation where users are added to or removed from lists in the partner platform
- **Property-based Cohort**: A cohort implementation where properties are set on user profiles in the partner platform
- **Integration Tile**: The configurable UI component that appears in Amplitude's interface
- **FreeMarker Templates**: Templating system used to customize event streaming payloads
- **Partner_id**: Required parameter for tracking events sent through partner integrations
- **Slugify**: Process of converting cohort names into URL-friendly formats

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's Partner Integration Platform extends the core Amplitude ecosystem by:

1. Expanding data collection capabilities through Event Ingestion integrations
2. Activating Amplitude insights in external tools through Cohort Syncing
3. Supporting real-time data workflows through Event Streaming

The platform connects Amplitude's analytics capabilities with partner tools across marketing, product, and data technology landscapes.

## API Endpoints and Technical Details

### Event Ingestion
- Uses Amplitude's HTTP v2 API endpoint
- Requires `partner_id` parameter in all events
- Authentication via project API key

### Cohort Syncing
For list-based integrations:
- Endpoint for list creation
- Endpoint for adding users to lists
- Endpoint for removing users from lists

For property-based integrations:
- Single endpoint for updating user properties

### Event Streaming
- Configurable destination endpoints
- Support for custom headers and authentication
- Payload customization via FreeMarker templates
- Batch processing capabilities with configurable sizes

All integrations undergo testing and validation before approval for the Amplitude marketplace.
