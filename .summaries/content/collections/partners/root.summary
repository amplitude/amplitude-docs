# Amplitude Partner Integration Platform

## Overview

Amplitude's Partner Integration Platform enables third-party partners to build and manage integrations with Amplitude's analytics and customer data platform. The platform supports three primary integration types that facilitate bidirectional data flow:

1. **Event Ingestion Integrations** - Send event data from partner platforms into Amplitude
2. **Cohort Syncing Integrations** - Export Amplitude behavioral cohorts to partner platforms
3. **Event Streaming Integrations** - Forward events from Amplitude to partner destinations in real-time

Partners can leverage these integration types to extend Amplitude's capabilities and allow customers to activate their Amplitude data across their technology stack.

## Product Relationships and Features

### Integration Portal

The Integration Portal serves as the central hub for partners to:
- Configure integration tiles for the Amplitude marketplace
- Test integrations in a sandbox environment
- Submit integrations for Amplitude approval
- Access analytics on integration performance

Access to the portal is invitation-based and requires partners to demonstrate customer demand for their integration.

### Event Ingestion Integrations

These integrations allow partners to send event data to Amplitude:
- Utilize Amplitude's HTTP v2 API
- Require a unique `partner_id` parameter for tracking and attribution
- Support customizable connection information
- Include configurable source setup instructions for end users

### Cohort Syncing Integrations

These integrations export Amplitude's behavioral cohorts to partner platforms through two implementation models:

**List-based integrations:**
- Create and manage lists of users in the destination platform
- Require endpoints for creating/updating lists, adding users, and removing users

**Property-based integrations:**
- Set user properties in the destination platform
- Require an endpoint for setting user properties

Both types support:
- Multiple authentication methods (Basic Auth, API Key, OAuth)
- Batch processing of cohort membership changes
- Scheduled syncs and real-time updates
- Retry mechanisms for failed API calls

### Event Streaming Integrations

These integrations forward events from Amplitude to partner destinations in real-time:
- Support customizable event payloads using FreeMarker templates
- Allow event filtering based on event types
- Enable user property mapping between Amplitude and destination platforms
- Include rate limiting capabilities
- Support various authentication methods

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Behavioral Cohort**: A group of users defined by their actions or behaviors in Amplitude
- **List-based Cohort**: Implementation where users are added to or removed from lists in the destination platform
- **Property-based Cohort**: Implementation where user properties are set in the destination platform
- **Integration Tile**: The configurable UI component that appears in Amplitude's marketplace
- **FreeMarker Templates**: A templating system used to customize event payloads in Event Streaming integrations
- **Partner_id**: A unique identifier assigned to partners for tracking events sent to Amplitude
- **Slugify**: The process of converting a cohort name into a URL-friendly format

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's Partner Integration Platform serves as a critical connector within a customer's data infrastructure:

1. **Data Source**: Event Ingestion integrations bring external data into Amplitude for analysis
2. **Data Activation**: Cohort Syncing and Event Streaming integrations activate insights by sending data to execution platforms
3. **Marketplace**: Creates an ecosystem of pre-built integrations for Amplitude customers
4. **Extended Functionality**: Partners can extend Amplitude's core capabilities through specialized tools

The platform enables a complete data lifecycle from collection to analysis to activation across a customer's technology stack.

## API Endpoints and Technical Details

### Event Ingestion Integration
- Uses Amplitude's HTTP v2 API endpoint
- Requires inclusion of `partner_id` parameter in event payloads
- Example payload structure:
  ```json
  {
    "api_key": "API_KEY",
    "events": [
      {
        "user_id": "USER_ID",
        "event_type": "EVENT_TYPE",
        "partner_id": "PARTNER_ID"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

### Cohort Syncing Integration
- **List-based API endpoints**:
  - Create/update list endpoint
  - Add users to list endpoint
  - Remove users from list endpoint
- **Property-based API endpoints**:
  - Set user property endpoint
- Supports batch processing with configurable batch sizes
- Implements error classification and handling

### Event Streaming Integration
- Configurable payload structure using FreeMarker templates
- Supports various authentication methods (Basic Auth, API Key, OAuth)
- Includes rate limiting considerations
- Allows for event filtering and property mapping

All integrations undergo validation and testing before being approved for the Amplitude marketplace.
