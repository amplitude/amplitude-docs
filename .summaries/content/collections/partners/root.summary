## Amplitude Partner Integration Platform

Amplitude operates a comprehensive partner integration ecosystem that enables third-party companies to build bidirectional data connections through a centralized **Integration Portal**. The platform facilitates seamless data exchange between Amplitude's behavioral analytics core and external partner systems, supporting both data ingestion and export workflows across the broader analytics and activation ecosystem.

## Integration Architecture and Relationships

The platform implements three interconnected integration patterns that form a complete data flow architecture:

**Event Ingestion Integrations** function as upstream data sources, channeling behavioral event data into Amplitude through the HTTP v2 API. These integrations surface as discoverable tiles on Amplitude's Sources page and require mandatory partner_id parameters for proper data attribution and routing within the analytics pipeline.

**Event Streaming Integrations** operate as downstream data destinations, providing real-time event and user property forwarding from Amplitude to partner platforms. The architecture leverages Freemarker templating engines for dynamic payload generation and supports sophisticated data transformation through event filtering, user property mapping via MappedProperties and MappedFields objects, and selective identify forwarding capabilities.

**Cohort Syncing Integrations** enable user segment export from Amplitude to partner activation platforms through two distinct architectural patterns: list-based integrations that create and maintain discrete user collections through dedicated API endpoints, and property-based integrations that directly modify user attributes on partner platform profiles.

## Core Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Integration Portal**: Self-service partner development environment for building, configuring, and testing integrations prior to marketplace submission and approval workflows.

**Integration Catalog**: Curated marketplace where approved partner integrations are published and made discoverable to Amplitude customers for installation and configuration.

**Cohort Syncing**: Automated user segment export process supporting both full synchronization and incremental update modes with configurable scheduling intervals (hourly/daily cadences).

**List-based vs Property-based Cohorts**: Architectural distinction where list-based patterns create managed user collections on partner platforms, while property-based patterns directly set user traits or custom attributes on individual user profiles.

**Freemarker Templates**: Server-side template engine enabling dynamic payload construction and customization within Event Streaming integrations for partner-specific data formatting requirements.

**MappedProperties/MappedFields**: Configuration schema objects that define field-level mapping relationships between Amplitude's user properties and event attributes to partner platform data models.

**Partner_id**: Required identifier parameter for Event Ingestion integrations ensuring proper data attribution, routing, and source tracking within Amplitude's data processing pipeline.

## Ecosystem Integration and Data Flow

The partner integration platform extends Amplitude's core behavioral analytics capabilities by creating a connected ecosystem of data sources and activation destinations. Event Ingestion integrations expand data collection surface area by enabling partners to contribute behavioral telemetry, while Event Streaming and Cohort Syncing integrations extend analytical insights into downstream personalization, marketing automation, and customer engagement workflows.

The platform implements enterprise-grade authentication supporting Basic Authentication, Bearer Token, and custom Authentication Headers. Reliability is ensured through exponential backoff retry mechanisms, configurable rate limiting, and comprehensive error handling across all integration types.

## Technical Implementation Specifications

**API Endpoints**: Cohort syncing utilizes RESTful APIs with dedicated endpoints for list creation, user addition, and user removal operations. Event ingestion leverages Amplitude's HTTP v2 API with mandatory partner_id parameter inclusion for proper data routing.

**Payload Customization**: Event Streaming integrations support extensive payload transformation through Freemarker templates with predefined variables including $items, $list_id, amplitude_cohort_name, and user_id_field_amplitude for dynamic content generation and partner-specific formatting.

**Batch Processing**: Cohort synchronization operates with configurable batch sizes (1000 users default) and supports concurrent processing with up to 4 parallel threads for optimized data transfer performance and throughput.

**Configuration Management**: The Integration Portal provides comprehensive self-service tooling for connection configuration, setup workflow definition, custom field mapping specification, and integration tile customization before submission to Amplitude's Engineering team for technical review and marketplace approval processes.
