## Amplitude Partner Integration Platform

Amplitude operates a comprehensive partner integration ecosystem that enables third-party platforms to build bidirectional data connections with Amplitude's analytics platform. The platform facilitates three core integration patterns: cohort syncing for exporting behavioral segments, event streaming for real-time data forwarding, and event ingestion for consolidating external data sources into Amplitude's analytics infrastructure.

## Product Architecture and Integration Relationships

The partner ecosystem centers around the **Integration Portal**, a self-service platform where partners develop, configure, and test their integrations before deployment to the **Integration Catalog** - Amplitude's public marketplace for approved integrations. This architecture creates a clear separation between development/testing environments and production deployment.

**Cohort Syncing Integrations** operate through Amplitude's Destinations interface, enabling automated export of user cohorts to partner platforms via two distinct patterns:
- **List-based integration**: Creates and manages discrete user lists on partner platforms through dedicated API endpoints
- **Property-based integration**: Sets user attributes or traits on partner platforms to indicate cohort membership status

**Event Streaming Integrations** provide real-time event forwarding capabilities, utilizing Freemarker templating for dynamic payload customization and supporting granular event filtering based on user properties and event characteristics.

**Event Ingestion Integrations** appear as data sources on Amplitude's Sources page, allowing partners to send event data through the HTTP v2 API and consolidate multiple data streams into Amplitude's unified analytics platform.

## Core Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Integration Portal**: Self-service development environment for partners to configure integration tiles, upload branding assets, and manage integration settings prior to catalog submission.

**Integration Catalog**: Public marketplace where approved integrations are deployed and accessible to Amplitude customers with Plus or Greater plan tiers.

**Destinations Page**: Customer-facing interface for configuring and managing outbound data flows (cohort syncing and event streaming integrations).

**Sources Page**: Customer interface for configuring inbound data integrations and event ingestion sources.

**Cohort Sync**: Automated process for exporting user segments from Amplitude, supporting both full synchronization and incremental updates with configurable scheduling intervals (hourly/daily).

**Freemarker Templates**: Template engine enabling dynamic payload generation and field mapping for event streaming integrations.

**MappedProperties/MappedFields**: Configuration objects defining transformation rules for Amplitude user properties and event fields when forwarding to partner platforms.

## Technical Implementation Framework

### API Endpoint Architecture
Cohort syncing integrations implement three primary endpoint patterns:
- **List Creation Endpoint**: Establishes new user lists on partner platforms
- **Add Users Endpoint**: Appends users to existing cohorts/lists
- **Remove Users Endpoint**: Removes users from cohorts/lists for incremental sync operations

### Authentication and Security
The platform supports multiple authentication schemes:
- **Basic Authentication**: Username/password or API key-based authentication
- **Bearer Token**: OAuth token-based authentication
- **Authentication Header**: Custom header-based authentication methods

### Data Processing and Templating
Partners leverage several templating variables for payload customization:
- **$items**: Batched user data for cohort operations
- **$list_id**: Dynamic cohort/list identifier placeholder
- **$amplitude_cohort_name**: Cohort name variable with slugify transformation support
- **item_template**: Structure definition for individual user records

### Performance and Reliability Features
The system implements enterprise-grade processing capabilities:
- Default batch size of 1000 users for cohort synchronization
- Concurrent processing using 4 threads for enhanced throughput
- Exponential backoff retry logic for API failure handling
- Comprehensive error status code management and reporting

### Testing and Validation Tools
The platform provides multiple validation mechanisms:
- CSV upload testing for cohort sync validation
- Endpoint connectivity testing for API verification
- Partner_id parameter validation for event ingestion
- "Release Internally" functionality for controlled pre-production testing

## Broader Ecosystem Integration

The partner integration platform serves as a critical component of Amplitude's data ecosystem, enabling customers to create comprehensive data workflows that extend beyond Amplitude's core analytics capabilities. Cohort destinations facilitate automated behavioral segment synchronization with marketing automation platforms, CRM systems, and advertising networks, enabling immediate action on analytical insights.

Event streaming destinations provide real-time event forwarding capabilities that trigger immediate responses in partner systems, supporting use cases like personalization engines, fraud detection systems, and customer support platforms. Event ingestion sources consolidate data from multiple customer touchpoints, creating a unified view of user behavior across web, mobile, server-side, and third-party platforms.

The platform supports co-marketing opportunities between Amplitude and partners, with approved integrations receiving visibility in the Integration Catalog and potential participation in joint marketing initiatives. All integrations require Amplitude Plus or Greater plans, ensuring enterprise-grade reliability, support, and access control for the partner ecosystem while maintaining Amplitude's premium positioning for advanced integration capabilities.
