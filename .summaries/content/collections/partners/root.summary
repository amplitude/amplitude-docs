# Amplitude Partner Integration Platform

Amplitude operates a comprehensive partner integration ecosystem built around the **Integration Portal**, a self-service platform enabling partners to create, configure, and manage integrations with Amplitude's behavioral analytics platform. The system facilitates bidirectional data flow through three core integration patterns: event ingestion, event streaming, and cohort synchronization, all designed to extend Amplitude's analytics capabilities across partner platforms.

## Integration Architecture and Relationships

The platform supports three distinct integration types that serve different data flow requirements within Amplitude's analytics ecosystem:

**Event Ingestion Integrations** enable partners to send behavioral data into Amplitude via the **HTTP v2 API**, appearing as options on Amplitude's **Sources page**. These integrations require **Project API Keys** for authentication and utilize the `partner_id` parameter for testing and tracking partner-specific data flows.

**Event Streaming Integrations** forward Amplitude's behavioral data to partner platforms using **Freemarker templates** for payload customization. These integrations leverage **MappedProperties** and **MappedFields** for user property mapping, support event filtering and identify forwarding, and appear as destination tiles in Amplitude's interface with REST API header configuration and rate limiting capabilities.

**Cohort Sync Integrations** export user cohorts from Amplitude to partner platforms through two distinct architectural patterns:
- **List-based cohort integration**: Manages user lists via list creation, add users, and remove users endpoints
- **Property-based cohort integration**: Sets user traits/properties directly on partner platforms

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Integration Portal**: Amplitude's self-service platform for partners to create and manage integrations
**Integration Catalog**: Public directory displaying approved integrations to Amplitude customers
**Sources page**: Amplitude interface showing available data ingestion options
**Destinations page**: Amplitude interface displaying data export and streaming options
**Integration tiles**: Visual representations of partner integrations within Amplitude's UI
**MappedProperties/MappedFields**: Configuration objects mapping Amplitude user properties to partner platform fields
**Freemarker templates**: Template engine for customizing event streaming payloads
**partner_id parameter**: Identifier for testing and tracking partner-specific data flows
**Release Internally**: Testing phase allowing partners to validate integrations before public submission
**slugify cohort names**: Functionality to format cohort names for partner platform compatibility
**amplitude_cohort_name variable**: Dynamic variable for cohort identification in partner systems
**user_id_field_amplitude mapping**: Configuration for mapping Amplitude user identifiers to partner fields

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The partner integration platform operates within Amplitude's behavioral analytics ecosystem, requiring **Plus or Greater Amplitude plans** for access. Integrations connect to Amplitude's core analytics engine using **Org ID-based** configuration, enabling seamless data exchange between Amplitude and partner platforms. The system provides co-marketing opportunities for approved partners and maintains quality control through review processes before integrations reach the public Integration Catalog.
