## Product Overview

Amplitude's billing and usage management system provides comprehensive tracking and reporting capabilities for organizations using the analytics platform. The system operates on a Monthly Tracked Users (MTU) billing model for Scholarship, Starter, and Plus plans, with sophisticated usage monitoring and reporting features available across different plan tiers.

## Product Relationships and Features

The billing system consists of two primary components that work in tandem:

**MTU Billing Engine**: Handles the core billing calculations based on Monthly Tracked Users, implementing complex user identification and event attribution logic. This system manages quota enforcement, user ID merging, and synthetic MTU calculations.

**Usage Reports System**: Provides organization-level analytics and monitoring capabilities through two main interfaces - User Metrics and Event Usage tabs. This system offers visibility into platform adoption and resource consumption patterns.

These components integrate to provide both billing accuracy and usage transparency, allowing organizations to understand their Amplitude consumption patterns while ensuring proper billing calculations.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Monthly Tracked Users (MTU)**: The primary billing metric representing unique users tracked within a calendar month, calculated using UTC time boundaries.

**User ID Merging/Consolidation**: Process where anonymous users are merged with identified users through identify calls, affecting MTU counts and billing calculations.

**Synthetic MTUs**: Additional MTU units calculated when events-per-MTU ratios exceed the 1,000 events per MTU threshold, ensuring billing accuracy for high-event-volume users.

**Drop Filters**: Data filtering mechanisms that can create discrepancies between ingested events and billable MTUs.

**Backfilled Events**: Historical events that impact MTU calculations when processed, potentially affecting billing for past periods.

**Event Query Counts**: Metrics tracking how events are queried and analyzed within Amplitude's analytics features.

**Active Users Chart**: Visualization showing user engagement patterns within the organization's Amplitude usage.

**Depth of Engagement**: Metrics measuring how extensively users interact with Amplitude's features and content.

## Ecosystem Integration

The billing and usage system integrates deeply with Amplitude's broader analytics platform:

- **Plan Tier Integration**: Different features are available based on subscription levels (Scholarship, Starter, Plus, Growth, Enterprise)
- **Permission System**: Usage reports require admin/manager permissions, indicating integration with Amplitude's role-based access control
- **Analytics Features**: The system tracks usage across charts, dashboards, notebooks, pathfinder analysis, and cohort definitions
- **Data Pipeline**: Integrates with event ingestion, user identification systems, and data processing workflows
- **Export Capabilities**: Provides CSV/JSON export functionality for external analysis and reporting
