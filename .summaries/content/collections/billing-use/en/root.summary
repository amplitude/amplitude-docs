# Amplitude Billing and Usage Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude is an analytics platform that provides organizations with insights into user behavior and product usage. The billing and usage components of Amplitude focus on tracking user engagement, monitoring event consumption, and managing subscription costs through a Monthly Tracked Users (MTU) model.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Monthly Tracked Users (MTUs)

MTUs are the primary billing metric in Amplitude, representing the count of unique users who perform trackable actions within the platform during a calendar month. Key aspects include:

- **Cross-Project Counting**: A user is counted only once across all projects within an organization
- **User Identification**: Users are identified through unique IDs, with both identified and anonymous users counting toward MTU totals
- **User Merging**: When anonymous users are later identified, Amplitude merges them to avoid double-counting
- **Synthetic MTUs**: Special user IDs used for testing or system events that count toward MTU totals

### Usage Reports

Amplitude provides comprehensive usage analytics through two main report types:

- **User Metrics**: Tracks active users, team engagement, and content usage patterns
- **Event Usage**: Monitors event volume and query counts across projects

## Relationship Between Products and Features

The billing and usage components work together to provide a complete view of platform utilization:

1. **MTU Tracking System**: Forms the foundation of Amplitude's billing model, counting unique users across the organization
2. **Usage Reports**: Built on top of the MTU tracking system to provide visibility into how teams are utilizing the platform
3. **Plan Limits and Overages**: Connect MTU tracking with the organization's subscription plan to manage costs

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Monthly Tracked User (MTU)**: A unique user who performs trackable actions within a calendar month
- **User ID**: The primary identifier for tracking unique users
- **Device ID**: A fallback identifier used when User ID is not available
- **Anonymous User**: A user without an explicit User ID, tracked by Device ID
- **Identified User**: A user with an explicit User ID
- **User Merging**: The process of combining anonymous user profiles with identified user profiles
- **Synthetic MTU**: Special user IDs for testing or system events
- **Events per MTU**: The ratio of total events to total MTUs
- **Backfilled Events**: Historical events added to the platform after they occurred
- **Weekly Learning Users**: Users who engage with Amplitude's learning content
- **Broadcasted Learnings**: Insights shared across the organization
- **Depth of Engagement**: Measurement of how thoroughly users interact with the platform

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The billing and usage components integrate with the broader Amplitude ecosystem in several ways:

1. **Cross-Project Analytics**: MTUs are calculated across all projects within an organization, supporting unified billing
2. **Plan Management**: Different pricing tiers (Growth, Enterprise) offer varying MTU limits and features
3. **Admin Tools**: Usage reports provide administrators with insights to optimize platform adoption
4. **User Identification System**: The MTU tracking leverages Amplitude's core user identification capabilities

## API Endpoints and Usage

While specific API endpoints aren't explicitly mentioned in the documentation, the usage reports can be accessed through the Amplitude interface by:

1. Navigating to the Usage Reports section in the Amplitude dashboard
2. Selecting either User Metrics or Event Usage reports
3. Filtering by date ranges and specific metrics of interest

The MTU calculation is handled automatically by the Amplitude platform based on the events and user identifiers sent to the system.
