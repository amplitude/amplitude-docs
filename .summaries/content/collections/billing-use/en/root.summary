## Amplitude Billing and Usage Management System

Amplitude provides a comprehensive billing and usage management system designed to help organizations monitor, track, and optimize their analytics platform consumption across different subscription tiers.

## Core Products and Features

### Monthly Tracked Users (MTU) Billing Model
The primary billing mechanism for Amplitude's Scholarship, Starter, and Plus plans centers around Monthly Tracked Users (MTU). This system calculates billing based on unique users tracked within monthly periods, with sophisticated user identification and merging capabilities that consolidate anonymous users with identified users through user ID mapping and identify calls.

### Usage Reports and Analytics
Amplitude offers organizational-level usage reports exclusively for Growth and Enterprise plans, providing detailed insights into platform adoption and consumption patterns. These reports enable administrators to understand how their organization utilizes Amplitude's analytics capabilities.

## Product Relationships and Integration

The billing system operates through two interconnected components:

**MTU Calculation Engine**: Processes user tracking data in UTC time, handles user ID consolidation, manages anonymous user merging, and calculates synthetic MTUs when events-per-MTU limits are exceeded (1,000 events per MTU threshold).

**Usage Reporting Dashboard**: Provides organizational analytics through User Metrics and Event Usage tabs, offering both visual charts and downloadable CSV/JSON reports for comprehensive usage analysis.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Monthly Tracked Users (MTU)**: Unique users tracked within a monthly billing period, serving as the primary billing unit for lower-tier plans.

**Synthetic MTUs**: Additional billing units calculated when events exceed the 1,000 events per MTU threshold, ensuring fair usage pricing.

**User ID Consolidation**: Process of merging anonymous users with identified users through user mapping and identify calls.

**Events Per MTU Limit**: Billing control mechanism that triggers synthetic MTU calculations when event volume exceeds predefined thresholds.

**Drop Filters**: Data filtering mechanisms that can create billing discrepancies by affecting MTU calculations.

**Backfilled Events**: Historical events that impact MTU calculations and billing when imported into the system.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The billing and usage system integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics platform through several touchpoints:

- **Event Ingestion Pipeline**: Processes all incoming events for MTU calculation and usage tracking
- **User Identity Management**: Handles user ID merging and anonymous user consolidation across the platform
- **Quota Enforcement System**: Manages account blocking for free plan overages and sampling ineligibility for MTU pricing violations
- **Administrative Controls**: Provides organization settings and admin permissions for usage report access
- **Analytics Features**: Excludes specific event types like [Experiment] Exposure events from billing calculations

## Technical Implementation Details

The system operates without specific API endpoints or command line invocations mentioned in the documentation, but includes:

- **UTC Time-based Billing Cycles**: Ensures consistent global billing calculations
- **Cross-project Views**: Enables usage tracking across multiple projects within an organization
- **CSV/JSON Export Functionality**: Allows programmatic access to usage data for external analysis
- **Real-time Quota Monitoring**: Provides immediate feedback on usage limits and potential overages

The billing system supports various chart types usage tracking, dashboard consumption monitoring, and notebook sharing analytics, providing comprehensive visibility into how organizations consume Amplitude's analytics capabilities while maintaining fair and transparent billing practices.
