# Amplitude Billing and Usage Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude is an analytics platform that provides organizations with insights into user behavior and product usage. The billing model is primarily based on Monthly Tracked Users (MTUs), with additional features for monitoring usage patterns across the organization. The platform offers different pricing plans with varying MTU limits and capabilities.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Monthly Tracked Users (MTUs)

MTUs are the primary metric used for billing in Amplitude. An MTU is a unique user who has generated at least one event within a calendar month. The system identifies unique users through:

- User ID tracking
- Device ID tracking for anonymous users
- Cross-project user identification
- User merging capabilities

### Usage Reports

Available to Growth and Enterprise plan customers, Usage Reports provide comprehensive insights into:

- User metrics (active users, engagement depth, top users/teams)
- Event usage data (query counts, event volumes)
- Weekly learning users and broadcasted learnings
- Content usage and KPI metrics

## Relationship Between Products and Features

The billing system integrates with the core analytics platform to track user activity and calculate MTUs. Usage Reports complement the billing system by providing detailed analytics on how the organization utilizes Amplitude, helping customers maximize the value of their subscription.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Monthly Tracked Users (MTUs)**: Unique users who generate at least one event in a calendar month
- **Anonymous Users**: Users without a User ID who are tracked by Device ID
- **User Merging**: The process of combining user profiles when a previously anonymous user is identified
- **Synthetic MTUs**: Users created through the API without generating events
- **Events per MTU**: The ratio of total events to MTUs, indicating user engagement intensity
- **Weekly Learning Users**: Users who view dashboards, charts, or other analytics content
- **Broadcasted Learnings**: Insights shared with other team members
- **Depth of Engagement**: Measurement of how deeply users engage with the platform

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The billing system and usage reports are integral components of Amplitude's overall analytics ecosystem:

1. The core analytics platform tracks user behavior and events
2. The billing system calculates MTUs based on this tracking data
3. Usage reports provide meta-analytics on how teams utilize the platform
4. Different pricing plans (Growth, Enterprise) offer varying levels of access to these features

## Technical Details

### MTU Calculation Specifics

- MTUs are calculated at the organization level, not the project level
- A user who appears in multiple projects counts as a single MTU
- Anonymous users are counted as unique MTUs based on their Device ID
- When anonymous users are identified with a User ID, they are merged to avoid double-counting
- Backfilled events count toward MTU calculations for the month they occurred in

### Usage Report Access

- Available through the Amplitude interface for Growth and Enterprise customers
- Provides export functionality for further analysis
- Updates on a regular basis to reflect current usage patterns

### Billing Mechanics

- Plans include specific MTU limits
- Overage charges apply when exceeding MTU limits
- Different pricing tiers offer varying events-per-MTU allowances
- Synthetic MTUs created through the API without events are not counted for billing
