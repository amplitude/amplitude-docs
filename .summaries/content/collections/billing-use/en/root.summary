## Amplitude Billing and Usage Analytics Platform

Amplitude provides a comprehensive billing and usage analytics platform designed for organizations on Growth and Enterprise plans to monitor platform adoption and optimize their analytics investment. The platform centers around two core billing models and usage tracking mechanisms that help administrators understand both user engagement and cost implications.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

The billing-use collection encompasses two interconnected product areas:

**Usage Reports** serve as the primary analytics dashboard for organization-level insights, providing administrators with visibility into platform adoption patterns, user engagement metrics, and content utilization across projects. This feature integrates with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem by tracking interactions with charts, dashboards, notebooks, and pathfinder analyses.

**MTU Billing System** operates as the foundational cost calculation engine for Scholarship, Starter, and Plus plan tiers, working in conjunction with event ingestion tracking to determine monthly charges based on unique user identification and event volume thresholds.

These systems work together to provide both operational insights (through usage reports) and financial transparency (through MTU calculations), enabling organizations to optimize their Amplitude investment.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Monthly Tracked Users (MTU)**: The primary billing metric representing unique users tracked within a calendar month, calculated using UTC time boundaries and serving as the foundation for plan pricing.

**Synthetic MTUs**: Additional billing units generated when event volume exceeds the standard 1,000 events per MTU threshold, calculated by dividing excess events by 1,000 to determine additional MTU charges.

**User ID Merging**: The process by which Amplitude consolidates anonymous device IDs with identified user IDs through mapping and identify calls, affecting MTU calculations by potentially reducing total unique user counts.

**Weekly Learning Users**: A usage report metric tracking users who actively engage with Amplitude's learning and discovery features on a weekly basis.

**Broadcasted Learnings**: Content sharing metrics within usage reports that track knowledge distribution across organization members.

**Drop Filters**: Data processing rules that can create billing discrepancies by filtering events post-ingestion, potentially affecting MTU calculations.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The billing and usage system integrates deeply with Amplitude's analytics platform architecture:

- **Cross-Project Analytics**: Usage reports aggregate data across multiple projects within an organization, providing unified visibility into platform adoption
- **Event Ingestion Pipeline**: MTU calculations tie directly into Amplitude's event processing system, with real-time tracking of user identification and event volume
- **Access Control Integration**: Usage reports respect Amplitude's permission system, restricting access to admins and managers on Growth/Enterprise plans
- **Export Capabilities**: Both systems support data export in CSV and JSON formats for external analysis and reporting

## API Endpoints and Access Methods

**Usage Reports Access**: Available through organization settings interface, restricted to admin and manager roles on Growth/Enterprise plans, with export functionality for CSV and JSON formats.

**MTU Monitoring**: Accessible through billing dashboards with real-time MTU tracking, overage alerts, and historical usage patterns.

The platform operates primarily through web-based interfaces within Amplitude's main application, with usage reports accessible via the organization settings panel and MTU information available through billing management interfaces. Export capabilities enable programmatic access to usage data for external analysis and integration with organizational reporting systems.
