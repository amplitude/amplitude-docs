## Amplitude Billing and Usage Analytics Platform

Amplitude provides a comprehensive billing and usage analytics platform designed to help organizations monitor their platform adoption and manage costs effectively. The platform serves Growth and Enterprise customers with sophisticated tracking capabilities for both user engagement and billing optimization.

## Product Relationships and Features

The billing and usage ecosystem consists of two primary components that work in tandem:

**Usage Reports** serve as the analytics layer, providing organization-level insights into platform adoption patterns. These reports track user engagement through weekly learning users metrics, content consumption via broadcasted learnings, and technical usage through query counts and event ingestion tracking.

**Monthly Tracked Users (MTU) Billing** functions as the cost management layer, implementing a usage-based pricing model that calculates charges based on unique user tracking across calendar months. This system includes sophisticated user identity resolution and synthetic MTU calculations for handling event volume overages.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Monthly Tracked Users (MTU)**: The core billing unit representing unique users tracked within a calendar month, calculated using UTC time boundaries. MTUs form the foundation of Amplitude's pricing model for Scholarship, Starter, and Plus plans.

**User ID Merging**: The process of consolidating multiple user identities (anonymous users, device IDs) into single trackable entities, directly impacting MTU calculations and billing accuracy.

**Synthetic MTUs**: Additional billing units generated when event volume exceeds the standard 1,000 events per MTU threshold, ensuring cost alignment with actual platform usage intensity.

**Weekly Learning Users**: A engagement metric tracking users who actively consume insights and analytics within the platform on a weekly basis.

**Broadcasted Learnings**: Content distribution metrics measuring how insights and discoveries are shared across the organization.

**Drop Filters**: Data processing rules that can create billing discrepancies by filtering events post-ingestion, potentially affecting MTU calculations.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The billing and usage system integrates deeply with Amplitude's broader analytics platform through several key touchpoints:

**Cross-Project Analytics**: Usage reports aggregate data across multiple projects within an organization, providing unified visibility into platform adoption patterns and enabling portfolio-level optimization decisions.

**Administrative Controls**: The system enforces role-based access through admin and manager permissions, ensuring billing insights and usage analytics remain accessible only to authorized Growth and Enterprise plan stakeholders.

**Data Export Capabilities**: Both usage reports and billing data support CSV and JSON export formats, enabling integration with external business intelligence tools and financial systems.

**Event Processing Pipeline**: The MTU billing system integrates with Amplitude's core event ingestion pipeline, handling complex scenarios including backfilled events, late-arriving data, and experimental event exclusions ([Experiment] Exposure and Assignment events).

## Technical Implementation Details

**Usage Reports Access**: Available through organization settings for Growth and Enterprise plan administrators and managers, providing dashboard, chart, and notebook usage analytics with depth of engagement metrics.

**MTU Calculation Engine**: Processes user identification calls, manages anonymous user tracking, and implements sophisticated user mapping logic to ensure accurate billing calculations while handling edge cases like timezone boundaries and data processing delays.

**Billing Edge Case Handling**: The system manages complex scenarios including backfilled events that can retroactively affect MTU counts, drop filter impacts on billing accuracy, and synthetic MTU generation for high-volume usage patterns.
