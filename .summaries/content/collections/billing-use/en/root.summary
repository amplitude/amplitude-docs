# Amplitude Billing and Usage Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude is an analytics platform that provides organizations with insights into user behavior and product usage. The billing and usage components of Amplitude focus on tracking user engagement, monitoring event consumption, and managing subscription costs through a Monthly Tracked Users (MTU) model.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Monthly Tracked Users (MTUs)

MTUs are the primary billing metric in Amplitude, representing the count of unique users who perform trackable actions within the platform each month. Key aspects include:

- **Cross-Project Counting**: A user is counted only once across all projects within an organization for billing purposes
- **User Identification**: Users are identified through unique IDs, with mechanisms to handle anonymous users and user merging
- **Synthetic MTUs**: Special user identifiers used for testing that don't count toward billing limits

### Usage Reports

Comprehensive analytics dashboards that provide organization-level insights into:

- **User Metrics**: Tracks active users, top teams, and content engagement
- **Event Usage**: Monitors event queries and consumption across projects
- **Adoption Patterns**: Helps administrators understand how teams use the platform

## Relationship Between Products and Features

The billing and usage components work together to provide a complete view of platform utilization:

1. **MTU Tracking System**: Forms the foundation of Amplitude's billing model, determining subscription costs
2. **Usage Reports**: Provide visibility into how MTUs and events are being consumed across the organization
3. **Plan Limits and Overages**: Different pricing plans have specific MTU and event volume allowances, with overage charges applying when limits are exceeded

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Monthly Tracked User (MTU)**: A unique user who performs trackable actions within a calendar month
- **Events per MTU**: The number of events that can be tracked for each user under a specific plan
- **Anonymous Users**: Users without explicit identification who are assigned temporary IDs
- **User Merging**: The process of consolidating multiple user identities into a single user profile
- **Backfilled Events**: Historical events added to the platform after they occurred
- **Weekly Learning Users**: Users who engage with learning content on a weekly basis
- **Broadcasted Learnings**: Insights shared across the organization
- **Depth of Engagement**: Measurement of how thoroughly users interact with the platform

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The billing and usage components integrate with the broader Amplitude ecosystem by:

1. **Supporting Multi-Project Organizations**: Allowing enterprises to manage multiple projects while maintaining unified billing
2. **Enabling Team-Based Analysis**: Providing insights into which teams are driving the most value from the platform
3. **Facilitating Resource Allocation**: Helping organizations understand where to invest in additional capacity
4. **Connecting to Growth/Enterprise Plans**: Different feature sets and limits based on subscription tier

## Technical Implementation

### Usage Reports Access

Usage reports are available to administrators through the Amplitude interface, with export functionality for further analysis. These reports are specifically available to customers on Growth and Enterprise plans.

### MTU Calculation Logic

The system employs specific logic to:
- Count unique users across projects
- Handle anonymous user identification
- Process user identity merges
- Exclude synthetic test users from billing calculations
- Track event volume per user

The platform provides mechanisms to monitor current usage against plan limits and project potential overage charges based on current usage patterns.
