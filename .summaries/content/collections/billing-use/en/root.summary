## Amplitude Billing and Usage Management

Amplitude provides comprehensive billing and usage management capabilities designed to help organizations monitor, understand, and optimize their platform consumption across different subscription tiers.

## Product Relationship and Features

The billing and usage management system consists of two primary components that work together to provide complete visibility into platform utilization:

**MTU Billing System** - The core billing mechanism for Scholarship, Starter, and Plus plans based on Monthly Tracked Users (MTU) calculations. This system tracks both anonymous users (via device IDs) and identified users (via user IDs), implementing sophisticated user profile merging and synthetic MTU calculations to determine billing charges.

**Usage Reports** - An analytics layer available exclusively to Growth and Enterprise plan administrators that provides organization-level insights into platform adoption, user engagement, and content utilization patterns across all projects.

These systems integrate through the Settings > Organization Settings > Plans & Billing interface, where administrators can monitor both MTU consumption and detailed usage analytics in a unified dashboard.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Monthly Tracked Users (MTU)** - The primary billing unit representing unique users tracked within a calendar month, calculated using UTC time zones and encompassing both anonymous device IDs and identified user IDs after profile merging.

**Synthetic MTU Calculation** - An overage protection mechanism that estimates MTU based on event volume when organizations exceed their plan limits, using a ratio of 1000 events per MTU.

**Weekly Learning Users** - A usage metric tracking users who actively engage with Amplitude's analytics features, including chart creation, dashboard interaction, and notebook usage.

**Broadcasted Learnings** - Shared insights and discoveries distributed across the organization, measured as part of platform adoption metrics.

**User Profile Merging** - The process of consolidating anonymous and identified user data through user mapping and identify calls, which directly impacts MTU calculations and billing.

**Drop Filters** - Data processing rules that can create billing discrepancies by filtering events after MTU calculations have been performed.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The billing and usage system operates as a foundational layer within Amplitude's broader analytics platform, interfacing with multiple ecosystem components:

**Data Ingestion Layer** - Monitors event ingestion rates and applies MTU calculations in real-time, with special handling for backfilled events that can impact historical billing periods.

**User Identity Management** - Integrates with Amplitude's user identification system to track anonymous-to-identified user transitions and implement proper profile merging for accurate MTU calculations.

**Analytics Platform** - Usage reports provide deep visibility into how teams utilize Amplitude's core analytics features, including Pathfinder analysis, query execution, and cross-project views.

**Administrative Controls** - The system enforces plan-based access controls, ensuring usage reports are restricted to Growth and Enterprise plan administrators while providing MTU visibility across all plan tiers.

## API and Interface Access

**Settings Interface** - Primary access through Settings > Organization Settings > Plans & Billing for MTU monitoring and billing management.

**Export Capabilities** - Usage reports support CSV and JSON export formats for external analysis and reporting.

**Cross-Project Views** - Administrative interfaces provide organization-wide visibility across all projects and teams.

**Real-time Monitoring** - Dashboard interfaces for tracking current MTU consumption, overage status, and usage patterns with depth of engagement metrics.

The system maintains sampling ineligibility for organizations approaching or exceeding MTU limits, ensuring accurate billing calculations while providing comprehensive usage analytics for platform optimization.
