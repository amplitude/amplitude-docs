# Amplitude Billing and Usage Product Overview

Amplitude is an analytics platform that provides organizations with tools to track and analyze user engagement and event data. The billing and usage components of Amplitude focus on monitoring consumption, managing costs, and providing visibility into platform adoption.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Monthly Tracked Users (MTUs)

Monthly Tracked Users (MTUs) are the primary billing metric in Amplitude. An MTU is a unique user who performs at least one event within a billing month. Key aspects of MTU calculation include:

- Users are uniquely identified across all projects within an organization
- User identification is based on Amplitude IDs, User IDs, or Device IDs
- Anonymous and identified users are counted separately but can be merged
- Synthetic MTUs (test users, bots) are included in billing calculations
- Each pricing plan has specific MTU limits and overage charges

### Usage Reports

Usage reports provide organization-level analytics on platform adoption and consumption, featuring:

- **User Metrics tab**: Displays active users, top teams, and content usage patterns
- **Event Usage tab**: Tracks event queries and volume across projects
- Metrics for weekly learning users and broadcasted learnings
- Depth of engagement measurements
- Query counts by project and team

## Relationship Between Products and Features

The billing and usage components work together to provide a comprehensive view of Amplitude consumption:

1. MTU tracking serves as the foundation for billing calculations
2. Usage reports provide visibility into how teams are utilizing the platform
3. Both components help organizations manage costs and optimize platform value

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Monthly Tracked User (MTU)**: A unique user who performs at least one event within a billing month
- **Events per MTU**: The ratio of total events to total MTUs, used to measure user engagement
- **Amplitude ID**: A unique identifier assigned to each user
- **User ID**: A custom identifier that can be assigned to users
- **Device ID**: A hardware-specific identifier for a user's device
- **Anonymous User**: A user without an assigned User ID
- **User Merging**: The process of combining multiple user identities into a single user profile
- **Synthetic MTU**: Test users, bots, or other non-human entities that generate events
- **Backfilled Events**: Historical events added to Amplitude after they occurred
- **Weekly Learning Users**: Users who engage with Amplitude's learning features weekly
- **Broadcasted Learnings**: Insights shared across an organization

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The billing and usage components integrate with the broader Amplitude ecosystem by:

1. Providing the financial framework for all Amplitude products
2. Offering visibility into how different teams utilize various Amplitude features
3. Supporting different pricing plans (Growth/Enterprise) with appropriate usage metrics
4. Enabling organizations to track adoption and maximize platform value

## API Endpoints and Tools

While specific API endpoints aren't detailed in the documentation, the usage reports feature provides administrative tools for:

- Accessing organization-level analytics
- Tracking event volume across projects
- Monitoring user engagement metrics
- Analyzing query patterns by team and project

Organizations can use these reports to understand adoption patterns, identify power users, and optimize their Amplitude implementation for maximum value.
