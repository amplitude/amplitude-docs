Amplitude's billing and usage management system is a comprehensive platform that tracks and reports analytics usage through a Monthly Tracked Users (MTU) billing model. The system serves organizations across Scholarship, Starter, and Plus plans with sophisticated monitoring capabilities that scale based on subscription tiers.

## Product Relationships and Features

The platform operates through two interconnected core systems:

**MTU Billing Engine** manages the foundational billing calculations, implementing complex user identification logic and event attribution mechanisms. This engine handles quota enforcement, user ID consolidation processes, and synthetic MTU calculations to ensure accurate billing across varying usage patterns.

**Usage Reports System** delivers organization-level analytics through dual interfaces - User Metrics and Event Usage tabs. This system provides comprehensive visibility into platform adoption patterns, resource consumption metrics, and user engagement analytics.

The integration between these systems creates a unified experience where billing accuracy is maintained while providing complete usage transparency, enabling organizations to optimize their Amplitude consumption and understand platform adoption patterns.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Monthly Tracked Users (MTU)** represents the core billing metric - unique users tracked within UTC-based calendar month boundaries, forming the foundation for subscription pricing calculations.

**User ID Merging/Consolidation** describes the process where anonymous user sessions are merged with identified users through identify API calls, directly impacting MTU counts and billing calculations.

**Synthetic MTUs** are additional billing units calculated when individual users generate more than 1,000 events per MTU threshold, ensuring proportional billing for high-volume event users.

**Drop Filters** are data filtering mechanisms that can create discrepancies between total ingested events and billable MTU calculations.

**Backfilled Events** refer to historical event data that affects MTU calculations retroactively when processed, potentially impacting billing for previous periods.

**Event Query Counts** track how events are accessed and analyzed across Amplitude's analytics features and visualizations.

**Active Users Chart** provides visualization of user engagement patterns within an organization's Amplitude implementation.

**Depth of Engagement** measures the extent of user interaction with Amplitude's feature set and analytical content.

## Ecosystem Integration

The billing system integrates comprehensively with Amplitude's analytics ecosystem through multiple touchpoints:

**Plan Tier Architecture** enables feature differentiation across subscription levels (Scholarship, Starter, Plus, Growth, Enterprise), with usage reporting capabilities scaling based on plan tier.

**Permission Framework** integrates with Amplitude's role-based access control, requiring admin/manager permissions for usage report access.

**Analytics Platform Integration** tracks usage across the complete feature set including charts, dashboards, notebooks, pathfinder analysis, and cohort definitions.

**Data Pipeline Integration** connects with event ingestion systems, user identification workflows, and data processing pipelines to ensure accurate billing calculations.

**Export Infrastructure** provides CSV/JSON export capabilities for external analysis and reporting workflows.

## Technical Implementation

**Billing Calculation Engine** operates on UTC-based monthly cycles with real-time MTU quota enforcement. The system implements account blocking for free plan overages and manages user mapping through identify API calls. [Experiment] Exposure events are specifically excluded from MTU calculations.

**Usage Monitoring Infrastructure** provides cross-project usage views, event volume ingestion tracking, and custom events monitoring. The system includes weekly learning user analytics and broadcasted learnings tracking capabilities.

**Data Access Layer** supports downloadable usage reports in multiple formats, organization-level analytics dashboards, and detailed content usage panels. Event query count tracking operates across all platform features to provide comprehensive usage visibility.

The system ensures billing accuracy through sophisticated user identification and event attribution while maintaining complete transparency into platform usage patterns, supporting both financial management and adoption optimization strategies for Amplitude customers.
