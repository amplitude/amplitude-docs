## Amplitude Billing and Usage Management System

Amplitude's billing and usage management system is a comprehensive platform designed to monitor, track, and optimize analytics consumption across different subscription tiers. The system operates on a Monthly Tracked Users (MTU) billing model for Scholarship, Starter, and Plus plans, while providing advanced usage analytics for Growth and Enterprise customers.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The billing system consists of two primary interconnected components that work together to provide complete usage visibility and billing accuracy:

The **MTU Calculation Engine** serves as the core billing processor, operating on UTC time cycles to ensure consistent global calculations. This engine handles sophisticated user identification through user ID consolidation, merging anonymous users with identified users via user mapping and identify calls. When usage patterns exceed the 1,000 events per MTU threshold, the system automatically calculates synthetic MTUs to maintain fair pricing structures.

The **Usage Reporting Dashboard** provides organizational-level analytics exclusively for Growth and Enterprise plans through two primary interfaces: User Metrics and Event Usage tabs. This dashboard offers both visual chart representations and programmatic data access through CSV/JSON export functionality, enabling comprehensive usage analysis across multiple projects within an organization.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Monthly Tracked Users (MTU)**: The primary billing unit representing unique users tracked within monthly billing periods, calculated through sophisticated user consolidation processes.

**Synthetic MTUs**: Additional billing units automatically generated when event volume exceeds the 1,000 events per MTU threshold, ensuring proportional billing for high-volume usage patterns.

**User ID Consolidation**: The process of merging anonymous user sessions with identified user profiles through user mapping and identify API calls, creating unified user journeys for accurate billing.

**Events Per MTU Limit**: A billing control mechanism that triggers synthetic MTU calculations when event volume surpasses predefined thresholds, maintaining fair usage pricing across different consumption patterns.

**Drop Filters**: Data filtering mechanisms that can impact billing calculations by affecting MTU computations, requiring careful consideration in billing reconciliation.

**Backfilled Events**: Historical event data that influences MTU calculations and billing when imported into the system, affecting retroactive billing periods.

## Ecosystem Integration and Platform Connectivity

The billing system integrates deeply with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem through multiple integration points:

The **Event Ingestion Pipeline** processes all incoming analytics events for both MTU calculation and usage tracking, while excluding specific event types like [Experiment] Exposure events from billing calculations. The **User Identity Management** system handles cross-platform user ID merging and anonymous user consolidation throughout the analytics platform.

A **Quota Enforcement System** manages account restrictions, implementing account blocking for free plan overages and sampling ineligibility for MTU pricing violations. **Administrative Controls** provide organization-level settings and admin permissions for usage report access, while **Analytics Features** integration enables usage tracking across chart types, dashboard consumption monitoring, and notebook sharing analytics.

## Technical Implementation and Data Access

The system operates through UTC time-based billing cycles ensuring consistent global billing calculations across all time zones. Cross-project views enable comprehensive usage tracking across multiple projects within organizational boundaries, while real-time quota monitoring provides immediate feedback on usage limits and potential overages.

Data access is facilitated through CSV/JSON export functionality, allowing programmatic access to usage data for external analysis and integration with organizational billing systems. The platform provides comprehensive visibility into analytics consumption patterns while maintaining transparent and fair billing practices across all subscription tiers.
