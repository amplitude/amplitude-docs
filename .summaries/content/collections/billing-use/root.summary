# Amplitude Billing and Usage Product Overview

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude is an analytics platform that provides organizations with insights into user behavior and product usage. The billing and usage components focus on tracking user engagement, monitoring event consumption, and managing subscription costs through a Monthly Tracked Users (MTU) model. This model allows organizations to understand their platform utilization while maintaining predictable billing based on unique user counts rather than raw event volume.

## Relationship Between Products and Features

The billing and usage ecosystem in Amplitude consists of several interconnected components:

1. **MTU Tracking System**: The foundation of Amplitude's billing model that counts unique users across the organization during a calendar month.

2. **Usage Reports**: Built on top of the MTU tracking system, these reports provide visibility into:
   - User engagement metrics
   - Event consumption patterns
   - Team adoption rates
   - Content utilization

3. **Plan Limits and Overages**: Connect MTU tracking with the organization's subscription plan to:
   - Monitor usage against plan limits
   - Calculate potential overage charges
   - Provide forecasting for future billing cycles

4. **Cross-Project Analytics**: Enables unified billing by calculating MTUs across all projects within an organization, preventing duplicate counting of the same user.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Monthly Tracked User (MTU)**: A unique user who performs trackable actions within a calendar month; the primary billing metric.

- **User ID**: The primary identifier for tracking unique users in Amplitude.

- **Device ID**: A fallback identifier used when User ID is not available, typically for anonymous users.

- **Anonymous User**: A user without an explicit User ID, tracked by Device ID.

- **Identified User**: A user with an explicit User ID assigned.

- **User Merging**: The process of combining anonymous user profiles with identified user profiles to prevent double-counting.

- **Synthetic MTU**: Special user IDs created for testing or system events that count toward MTU totals.

- **Events per MTU**: The ratio of total events to total MTUs, indicating usage efficiency.

- **Backfilled Events**: Historical events added to the platform after they occurred.

- **Weekly Learning Users**: Users who engage with Amplitude's learning content.

- **Broadcasted Learnings**: Insights shared across the organization through Amplitude's sharing features.

- **Depth of Engagement**: Measurement of how thoroughly users interact with the platform.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The billing and usage components integrate with the broader Amplitude ecosystem in several ways:

1. **Cross-Project Analytics**: MTUs are calculated across all projects within an organization, supporting unified billing and preventing duplicate counting.

2. **Plan Management**: Different pricing tiers (Growth, Enterprise) offer varying MTU limits and features, with the billing system tracking usage against these limits.

3. **Admin Tools**: Usage reports provide administrators with insights to optimize platform adoption and manage costs effectively.

4. **User Identification System**: The MTU tracking leverages Amplitude's core user identification capabilities, including the ability to merge anonymous and identified users.

5. **Event Processing Pipeline**: All events processed through Amplitude's analytics engine are counted toward usage metrics and ultimately affect MTU calculations.

The billing and usage components serve as both administrative tools for managing costs and analytical tools for understanding platform adoption and utilization patterns across the organization.
