# Amplitude Billing and Usage Product Overview

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude is an analytics platform that provides organizations with insights into user behavior and product usage. The billing and usage components focus on tracking user engagement, monitoring event consumption, and managing subscription costs through a Monthly Tracked Users (MTU) model. This system allows organizations to understand their platform utilization while maintaining predictable subscription costs based on actual usage.

## Relationship Between Products and Features

The billing and usage components form an integrated system that enables organizations to:

1. **Track and Manage MTUs**: The core billing metric that counts unique users performing trackable actions each month
2. **Monitor Event Consumption**: Track the volume of events being processed across projects
3. **Analyze Usage Patterns**: Understand which teams and projects are driving the most platform engagement
4. **Control Costs**: Manage subscription expenses by monitoring usage against plan limits
5. **Optimize Resource Allocation**: Make data-driven decisions about where to invest in additional capacity

These components work together to provide a comprehensive view of how the organization is utilizing the Amplitude platform, with specific tools for administrators to monitor and manage costs.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Monthly Tracked User (MTU)**: A unique user who performs trackable actions within a calendar month; counted only once across all projects for billing purposes
- **Events per MTU**: The number of events that can be tracked for each user under a specific subscription plan
- **Anonymous Users**: Users without explicit identification who are assigned temporary IDs by the system
- **User Merging**: The process of consolidating multiple user identities into a single user profile, affecting MTU counts
- **Synthetic MTUs**: Special user identifiers used for testing that don't count toward billing limits
- **Backfilled Events**: Historical events added to the platform after they occurred
- **Weekly Learning Users**: Users who engage with learning content on a weekly basis
- **Broadcasted Learnings**: Insights shared across the organization
- **Depth of Engagement**: Measurement of how thoroughly users interact with the platform

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The billing and usage components integrate with the broader Amplitude ecosystem by:

1. **Supporting Multi-Project Organizations**: The MTU model counts users across all projects, enabling enterprises to manage multiple projects while maintaining unified billing
2. **Enabling Team-Based Analysis**: Usage reports provide insights into which teams are driving the most value from the platform
3. **Facilitating Resource Allocation**: Usage patterns help organizations understand where to invest in additional capacity
4. **Connecting to Growth/Enterprise Plans**: Different feature sets and limits are available based on subscription tier, with usage reports specifically available to customers on Growth and Enterprise plans
5. **Cross-Project User Identification**: The system tracks unique users across all projects, ensuring accurate billing regardless of how users interact with different parts of the organization's implementation

The billing model is designed to scale with organizational needs while providing transparency into how platform resources are being consumed, allowing for better planning and cost management.
