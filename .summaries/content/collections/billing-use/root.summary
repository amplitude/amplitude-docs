# Amplitude Billing and Usage Product Overview

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude is an analytics platform that helps organizations track and analyze user engagement and event data. The billing and usage components focus on consumption monitoring, cost management, and platform adoption visibility. The primary billing metric is Monthly Tracked Users (MTUs), which counts unique users who perform at least one event within a billing month.

## Product and Feature Relationships

The billing and usage components form an integrated system for managing Amplitude consumption:

1. **MTU Tracking System**: Forms the foundation for billing calculations
   - Identifies unique users across all organizational projects
   - Counts both anonymous and identified users
   - Includes synthetic users (test accounts, bots) in billing calculations
   - Supports different pricing plans with specific MTU limits and overage charges

2. **Usage Reports**: Provides organization-level analytics on platform adoption
   - User Metrics tab: Shows active users, top teams, and content usage patterns
   - Event Usage tab: Tracks event queries and volume across projects
   - Offers engagement depth measurements and query counts by project/team

3. **Cost Management Tools**: Help organizations optimize platform value
   - MTU monitoring to prevent unexpected overage charges
   - Usage pattern analysis to identify optimization opportunities
   - Team-level metrics to track adoption across the organization

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Monthly Tracked User (MTU)**: A unique user who performs at least one event within a billing month
- **Events per MTU**: Ratio of total events to total MTUs, measuring user engagement
- **Amplitude ID**: Unique identifier automatically assigned to each user
- **User ID**: Custom identifier that can be assigned to users
- **Device ID**: Hardware-specific identifier for a user's device
- **Anonymous User**: User without an assigned User ID
- **User Merging**: Process of combining multiple user identities into a single profile
- **Synthetic MTU**: Test users, bots, or other non-human entities generating events
- **Backfilled Events**: Historical events added to Amplitude after they occurred
- **Weekly Learning Users**: Users engaging with Amplitude's learning features weekly
- **Broadcasted Learnings**: Insights shared across an organization

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The billing and usage components serve as the financial and adoption framework for the entire Amplitude platform:

1. They provide the financial structure for all Amplitude products
2. They offer visibility into how different teams utilize various Amplitude features
3. They support different pricing tiers (Growth/Enterprise) with appropriate usage metrics
4. They enable organizations to track adoption and maximize platform value

The usage reports specifically help organizations understand:
- Which teams are power users of the platform
- How event volume is distributed across projects
- Patterns in query usage and content engagement
- Opportunities to optimize implementation for maximum value

While specific API endpoints aren't detailed in the documentation, the usage reports feature provides administrative tools for accessing organization-level analytics, tracking event volume, monitoring user engagement, and analyzing query patterns by team and project.
