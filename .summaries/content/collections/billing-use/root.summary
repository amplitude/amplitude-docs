# Amplitude Billing and Usage Product Overview

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude is an analytics platform that provides organizations with insights into user behavior and product usage. The platform employs a billing model primarily based on Monthly Tracked Users (MTUs), with additional features for monitoring usage patterns across the organization. Amplitude offers different pricing plans (Growth, Enterprise) with varying MTU limits and capabilities to accommodate different organizational needs.

## Product and Feature Relationships

The Amplitude billing system is tightly integrated with the core analytics platform:

1. **Core Analytics Platform**: Tracks user behavior and events across digital products
2. **Billing System**: Calculates MTUs based on tracking data from the analytics platform
3. **Usage Reports**: Provides meta-analytics on how teams utilize the platform (available to Growth and Enterprise customers)
4. **Pricing Plans**: Different tiers (Growth, Enterprise) offer varying levels of access to features and MTU allowances

The billing system serves as both a mechanism for charging customers and a way to understand product adoption. Usage Reports complement the billing system by providing detailed analytics on organizational utilization of Amplitude, helping customers maximize their subscription value.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Monthly Tracked Users (MTUs)**: Unique users who generate at least one event in a calendar month; the primary metric for billing
- **Anonymous Users**: Users without a User ID who are tracked by Device ID
- **User Merging**: The process of combining user profiles when a previously anonymous user is identified
- **Synthetic MTUs**: Users created through the API without generating events (not counted for billing)
- **Events per MTU**: The ratio of total events to MTUs, indicating user engagement intensity
- **Weekly Learning Users**: Users who view dashboards, charts, or other analytics content
- **Broadcasted Learnings**: Insights shared with other team members
- **Depth of Engagement**: Measurement of how deeply users engage with the platform
- **User ID tracking**: Primary method for identifying unique users
- **Device ID tracking**: Method for identifying anonymous users
- **Cross-project user identification**: System for recognizing the same user across different projects

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's billing and usage system fits into the broader analytics ecosystem by:

1. Providing a usage-based pricing model that scales with customer adoption
2. Offering meta-analytics through Usage Reports that help organizations understand their internal Amplitude adoption
3. Supporting different pricing tiers that align with different organizational needs and usage patterns
4. Enabling organizations to track and optimize their Amplitude usage to maximize ROI

The billing system is designed to be transparent, allowing customers to understand exactly what they're paying for and how their usage patterns affect costs.

## Technical Details

### MTU Calculation Specifics

- MTUs are calculated at the organization level, not the project level
- A user who appears in multiple projects counts as a single MTU
- Anonymous users are counted as unique MTUs based on their Device ID
- When anonymous users are identified with a User ID, they are merged to avoid double-counting
- Backfilled events count toward MTU calculations for the month they occurred in

### Usage Report Access

- Available through the Amplitude interface for Growth and Enterprise customers
- Provides export functionality for further analysis
- Updates regularly to reflect current usage patterns

### Billing Mechanics

- Plans include specific MTU limits
- Overage charges apply when exceeding MTU limits
- Different pricing tiers offer varying events-per-MTU allowances
- Synthetic MTUs created through the API without events are not counted for billing
