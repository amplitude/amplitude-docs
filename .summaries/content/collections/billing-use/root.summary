## Amplitude Billing and Usage Analytics Platform

Amplitude's billing and usage analytics platform provides comprehensive cost management and adoption tracking capabilities for Growth and Enterprise customers. The platform combines real-time usage monitoring with sophisticated billing calculations to help organizations optimize their analytics investment and track platform adoption across their teams.

## Product Relationships and Features

The platform operates through two interconnected systems that provide complementary visibility into platform utilization:

**Usage Reports** function as the operational analytics layer, delivering organization-wide insights into how teams engage with Amplitude's analytics capabilities. These reports track engagement patterns through weekly learning users metrics, measure knowledge sharing via broadcasted learnings distribution, and monitor technical consumption through query execution counts and event ingestion volumes.

**Monthly Tracked Users (MTU) Billing** operates as the financial management layer, implementing usage-based pricing calculations that determine costs based on unique user tracking within calendar month boundaries. This system incorporates advanced user identity resolution logic and synthetic MTU generation to handle high-volume usage scenarios.

The two systems work together to provide complete visibility into both the business value derived from analytics adoption and the associated costs, enabling data-driven decisions about platform optimization and resource allocation.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Monthly Tracked Users (MTU)**: The fundamental billing unit representing unique users tracked within a calendar month using UTC time boundaries. MTUs serve as the primary pricing metric for Scholarship, Starter, and Plus plan tiers.

**User ID Merging**: The identity resolution process that consolidates multiple user identifiers (anonymous users, device IDs, user IDs) into unified trackable entities, directly impacting MTU calculations and billing accuracy.

**Synthetic MTUs**: Supplementary billing units automatically generated when event volume exceeds the standard 1,000 events per MTU ratio, ensuring pricing alignment with actual platform usage intensity and data processing costs.

**Weekly Learning Users**: An engagement metric quantifying users who actively consume analytics insights, dashboards, and reports within the platform during weekly measurement periods.

**Broadcasted Learnings**: Content distribution metrics tracking how analytical insights and discoveries are shared across organizational teams and stakeholders.

**Drop Filters**: Data processing rules that can create billing discrepancies by filtering events after ingestion, potentially affecting MTU calculations and requiring careful monitoring for billing accuracy.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The billing and usage system integrates extensively with Amplitude's core analytics platform through multiple integration points:

**Cross-Project Analytics**: Usage reports aggregate utilization data across all projects within an organization, providing unified visibility into platform adoption patterns and enabling portfolio-level usage optimization strategies.

**Administrative Access Controls**: The system implements role-based permissions restricting billing insights and usage analytics to admin and manager roles within Growth and Enterprise plans, ensuring sensitive financial data remains appropriately secured.

**Data Export Infrastructure**: Both usage reports and billing data support CSV and JSON export formats, facilitating integration with external business intelligence platforms, financial reporting systems, and cost management tools.

**Event Processing Integration**: The MTU billing system connects directly with Amplitude's event ingestion pipeline, handling complex data scenarios including backfilled events, late-arriving data, timezone processing, and experimental event exclusions (specifically [Experiment] Exposure and Assignment events).

## Technical Implementation Details

**Usage Reports Access**: Available through organization settings interfaces for Growth and Enterprise plan administrators and managers, providing comprehensive analytics on dashboard utilization, chart interactions, and notebook engagement with detailed depth-of-use metrics.

**MTU Calculation Engine**: Processes user identification API calls, manages anonymous user tracking workflows, and implements sophisticated user identity mapping algorithms to ensure accurate billing calculations while handling edge cases including timezone boundary processing and delayed data arrival scenarios.

**Billing Edge Case Management**: The system handles complex billing scenarios including retroactive MTU adjustments from backfilled events, drop filter impact assessment on billing accuracy, and automated synthetic MTU generation for high-volume usage patterns that exceed standard event-to-user ratios.
