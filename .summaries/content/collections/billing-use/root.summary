## Amplitude Billing and Usage Management

Amplitude's billing and usage management system provides comprehensive monitoring and optimization capabilities for platform consumption across subscription tiers. The system serves as both a billing mechanism and analytics platform, enabling organizations to track costs while gaining insights into platform adoption patterns.

## Product Relationship and Feature Architecture

The billing ecosystem operates through two interconnected components that provide complete visibility into platform utilization:

**MTU Billing System** functions as the core billing engine for Scholarship, Starter, and Plus plans, calculating charges based on Monthly Tracked Users (MTU). This system processes both anonymous users (device IDs) and identified users (user IDs), implementing sophisticated user profile merging algorithms and synthetic MTU calculations to determine accurate billing charges.

**Usage Reports** serve as an analytics overlay exclusively available to Growth and Enterprise plan administrators, delivering organization-level insights into platform adoption, user engagement patterns, and content utilization across all projects. These reports provide strategic visibility into how teams leverage Amplitude's analytics capabilities.

Both components integrate seamlessly through the Settings > Organization Settings > Plans & Billing interface, creating a unified dashboard where administrators can simultaneously monitor MTU consumption and analyze detailed usage analytics.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Monthly Tracked Users (MTU)** - The fundamental billing unit representing unique users tracked within a calendar month, calculated using UTC time zones and encompassing both anonymous device IDs and identified user IDs after profile consolidation.

**Synthetic MTU Calculation** - An overage protection mechanism that estimates MTU based on event volume when organizations exceed plan limits, applying a standardized ratio of 1000 events per MTU to prevent billing surprises.

**Weekly Learning Users** - A usage metric quantifying users who actively engage with Amplitude's analytics features, including chart creation, dashboard interaction, and notebook utilization, providing insights into platform adoption depth.

**Broadcasted Learnings** - Shared insights and discoveries distributed across the organization, measured as part of platform adoption metrics to track knowledge sharing and collaboration effectiveness.

**User Profile Merging** - The process of consolidating anonymous and identified user data through user mapping and identify calls, directly impacting MTU calculations and billing accuracy by preventing duplicate user counting.

**Drop Filters** - Data processing rules that can create billing discrepancies by filtering events after MTU calculations have been performed, requiring careful consideration in billing reconciliation.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The billing and usage system operates as a foundational infrastructure layer within Amplitude's analytics platform, interfacing with multiple ecosystem components:

**Data Ingestion Layer** - Monitors real-time event ingestion rates and applies MTU calculations continuously, with specialized handling for backfilled events that can retroactively impact historical billing periods and require billing adjustments.

**User Identity Management** - Integrates deeply with Amplitude's user identification system to track anonymous-to-identified user transitions and implement proper profile merging, ensuring accurate MTU calculations while maintaining user journey continuity.

**Analytics Platform** - Usage reports provide comprehensive visibility into team utilization of Amplitude's core analytics features, including Pathfinder analysis execution, query performance, and cross-project analytical workflows.

**Administrative Controls** - The system enforces plan-based access controls and permissions, restricting usage reports to Growth and Enterprise plan administrators while providing MTU visibility and basic billing information across all plan tiers.

## API Endpoints and Interface Access

**Settings Interface** - Primary administrative access through Settings > Organization Settings > Plans & Billing for comprehensive MTU monitoring, billing management, and usage analytics review.

**Export Capabilities** - Usage reports support both CSV and JSON export formats, enabling external analysis, reporting integration, and data warehouse connectivity for advanced analytics.

**Cross-Project Views** - Administrative interfaces provide organization-wide visibility across all projects and teams, enabling centralized monitoring and resource allocation decisions.

**Real-time Monitoring** - Dashboard interfaces deliver current MTU consumption tracking, overage status monitoring, and usage pattern analysis with depth of engagement metrics for proactive platform management.

The system maintains sampling ineligibility for organizations approaching or exceeding MTU limits, ensuring accurate billing calculations while providing comprehensive usage analytics for platform optimization and strategic planning.
