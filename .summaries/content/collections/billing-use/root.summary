# Amplitude Billing and Usage Analytics Platform

Amplitude's billing and usage analytics platform provides comprehensive monitoring and optimization tools for organizations on Growth and Enterprise plans to track platform adoption and manage analytics investments. The platform operates through two primary systems: Usage Reports for operational insights and MTU Billing for cost management, both designed to maximize value from Amplitude's analytics ecosystem.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

The billing-use system integrates two complementary product areas that work synergistically:

**Usage Reports** function as the central analytics dashboard for organization-level visibility, tracking platform adoption patterns, user engagement metrics, and content utilization across projects. These reports monitor interactions with charts, dashboards, notebooks, and pathfinder analyses, providing administrators with actionable insights into how teams leverage Amplitude's capabilities.

**MTU Billing System** serves as the cost calculation engine for Scholarship, Starter, and Plus plan tiers, operating alongside event ingestion tracking to determine monthly charges based on unique user identification and event volume thresholds. This system provides real-time billing transparency and overage management.

The integration between these systems enables organizations to correlate usage patterns with costs, optimize team engagement, and make data-driven decisions about their Amplitude investment. Usage Reports inform strategic decisions about feature adoption, while MTU Billing ensures cost predictability and budget management.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Monthly Tracked Users (MTU)**: The foundational billing metric representing unique users tracked within a calendar month using UTC time boundaries. MTUs serve as the primary unit for plan pricing calculations across Amplitude's billing tiers.

**Synthetic MTUs**: Additional billing units automatically generated when event volume exceeds the standard 1,000 events per MTU threshold. Calculated by dividing excess events by 1,000, synthetic MTUs ensure fair billing for high-volume usage patterns.

**User ID Merging**: Amplitude's process for consolidating anonymous device IDs with identified user IDs through mapping and identify calls. This mechanism can reduce total unique user counts and optimize MTU calculations by eliminating duplicate user tracking.

**Weekly Learning Users**: A usage report metric quantifying users who actively engage with Amplitude's learning and discovery features on a weekly basis, indicating platform adoption depth and user skill development.

**Broadcasted Learnings**: Content sharing metrics tracking knowledge distribution across organization members, measuring how insights and discoveries propagate through teams.

**Drop Filters**: Data processing rules that can create billing discrepancies by filtering events after ingestion, potentially affecting MTU calculations and requiring careful monitoring to ensure billing accuracy.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The billing and usage system integrates comprehensively with Amplitude's analytics platform architecture:

**Cross-Project Analytics**: Usage reports aggregate data across multiple projects within an organization, providing unified visibility into platform adoption patterns and enabling enterprise-level insights into analytics utilization.

**Event Ingestion Pipeline**: MTU calculations integrate directly with Amplitude's event processing system, providing real-time tracking of user identification, event volume, and billing implications as data flows through the platform.

**Access Control Integration**: The system respects Amplitude's permission architecture, restricting usage report access to admins and managers on Growth/Enterprise plans while maintaining data security and organizational governance.

**Export Capabilities**: Both systems support comprehensive data export in CSV and JSON formats, enabling external analysis, custom reporting, and integration with organizational business intelligence systems.

## API Endpoints and Access Methods

**Usage Reports Access**: Available through the organization settings interface at the admin level, with role-based restrictions ensuring only authorized personnel can access sensitive usage data. Export functionality supports both CSV and JSON formats for programmatic integration.

**MTU Monitoring Interface**: Accessible through billing dashboards with real-time MTU tracking capabilities, overage alert systems, and historical usage pattern analysis for trend identification and budget planning.

**Billing Management APIs**: While primarily web-based, the platform provides programmatic access to usage data through export mechanisms, enabling integration with external financial systems and custom reporting workflows.

The platform operates primarily through web-based interfaces within Amplitude's main application, with usage reports accessible via organization settings panels and MTU information available through dedicated billing management interfaces. This architecture ensures seamless integration with existing Amplitude workflows while providing the specialized functionality needed for enterprise billing and usage management.
