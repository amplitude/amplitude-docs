# Amplitude Data Tables: Comprehensive Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude Data Tables is an advanced analytics feature that enables multi-dimensional analysis of user behavior data. It allows users to compare multiple metrics across different dimensions in a single view, providing powerful insights into user engagement, marketing attribution, and session-based metrics. Data Tables is primarily available on Amplitude's Growth and Enterprise plans and serves as a flexible tool for creating complex analyses that would otherwise require multiple separate charts.

## Key Features and Capabilities

### Multi-Dimensional Analysis
- Compare multiple metrics across different dimensions in a single view
- Apply group-by properties to organize data hierarchically
- Support for nested group-by properties for deeper analysis
- Transpose feature to switch rows and columns for different visualization perspectives

### Metrics Creation and Management
- Create reusable analysis objects (metrics) that can be shared project-wide
- Support for various metric types:
  - Event Segmentation metrics
  - Revenue metrics
  - Formula metrics
  - Funnel metrics
- Official metric designation capability for managers and administrators

### Session-Based Analysis
- Session metrics including bounce rate, exit rate, entry rate, entries, and exits
- Entry/Exit Analysis to analyze first or last property values in sessions
- Time Spent Analysis to measure duration between consecutive events
- Support for metrics like uniques, event totals, session totals, and PROPSUM

### Marketing Attribution
- Multiple attribution models for crediting marketing touchpoints:
  - First Touch: 100% credit to first touchpoint
  - Last Touch: 100% credit to last touchpoint
  - Linear: Equal credit across all touchpoints
  - Participation: 100% credit to all touchpoints
  - U-Shaped: 40% to first, 40% to last, 20% distributed among middle touchpoints
  - J-Shaped: 20% to first, 60% to last, 20% distributed among middle touchpoints
  - Inverse J-Shaped: 60% to first, 20% to last, 20% distributed among middle touchpoints
  - Data-Driven: Uses Markov chains to determine influence
- Custom attribution models with user-defined weighting distributions
- Configurable lookback windows for attribution analysis

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Metrics
Reusable analysis objects that can be created by any member, manager, or admin. Only managers and administrators can designate metrics as "official." Metrics are shared project-wide.

### Group-by Properties
Dimensions used to segment data in Data Tables, allowing for hierarchical organization of results.

### Session Metrics
- **Bounce Rate**: Percentage of sessions with only one event for a given property value
- **Exit Rate**: Percentage of sessions that end with a specific property value
- **Entry Rate**: Percentage of sessions that begin with a specific property value
- **Entries**: Count of sessions that begin with a specific property value
- **Exits**: Count of sessions that end with a specific property value

### Time Spent Analysis
Measures duration between consecutive events with a 30-minute timeout. Resets when group-by property values change.

### Entry/Exit Analysis
Analyzes data based on the first (entry) or last (exit) property value in a session.

### Attribution Models
Methods for distributing credit across multiple marketing touchpoints that contribute to conversions.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Data Tables integrates with the broader Amplitude Analytics platform, serving as an advanced analysis tool that complements other Amplitude features:

- Uses the same event and user property data as other Amplitude charts
- Metrics created in Data Tables can be reused across the Amplitude platform
- Supports export to CSV for further analysis in external tools
- Results can be accessed via the Amplitude REST API

## Technical Specifications and Limitations

### Data Display and Export Limits
- Display limits: 100-500 rows for top-level group-bys
- CSV export: Up to 10,000 rows
- REST API: Limited to 1,000 rows

### API and Export Capabilities
- CSV export available for larger datasets
- REST API access with query limits
- Special handling for time properties in exports

### Configuration Options
- Time Spent Analysis requires Growth or Enterprise plan
- Attribution models can be configured on individual metrics
- Lookback windows can be customized for attribution analysis
- Session metrics require proper event instrumentation with page-level properties

## Usage Examples

1. **Marketing Channel Analysis**: Compare conversion rates across different marketing channels using various attribution models
2. **Content Engagement**: Analyze time spent on different pages to identify engaging content
3. **User Journey Analysis**: Use entry/exit analysis to understand where users begin and end their sessions
4. **Funnel Performance**: Compare conversion rates across different user segments or time periods
5. **Page Performance**: Evaluate content paths using session metrics like bounce rate and exit rate

Data Tables provides a flexible, powerful interface for complex data analysis that would otherwise require multiple charts or external tools, making it a central component of Amplitude's advanced analytics capabilities.
