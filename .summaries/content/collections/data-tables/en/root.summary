# Amplitude Data Tables Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude Data Tables is an advanced analytics feature that enables multi-dimensional analysis of user behavior data. It allows users to compare multiple metrics across different dimensions in a single view, providing a comprehensive way to analyze complex data relationships. Data Tables is primarily available on Amplitude's Growth and Enterprise plans and serves as a powerful tool for marketing attribution, segment analysis, and experiment analysis.

## Key Features and Capabilities

### Multi-Dimensional Analysis
- Compare multiple metrics across different dimensions in a single view
- Apply group-by properties to organize data hierarchically
- Support for nested group-by properties for deeper analysis
- Transpose rows and columns for different visualization perspectives
- Filter capabilities to focus on specific data segments

### Metrics System
- Create reusable analysis objects (metrics) that can be shared project-wide
- Four metric types supported: Event Segmentation, Revenue, Formula, and Funnel
- Official designation capability for verified metrics (managers/admins only)
- Metrics can be created by any member but only designated as official by managers/admins

### Attribution Analysis
- Multiple attribution models for crediting marketing touchpoints:
  - First Touch: 100% credit to first touchpoint
  - Last Touch: 100% credit to last touchpoint
  - Linear: Equal credit across all touchpoints
  - Participation: 100% credit to each touchpoint
  - U-Shaped: 40% to first, 40% to last, 20% distributed among middle touchpoints
  - J-Shaped: 20% to first, 60% to last, 20% distributed among middle touchpoints
  - Inverse J-Shaped: 60% to first, 20% to last, 20% distributed among middle touchpoints
  - Data Driven: Uses Markov Chain modeling for algorithmic attribution
- Custom attribution models with specific weighting distributions
- Configurable lookback windows for attribution analysis

### Session Analysis
- Session metrics including bounce rate, exit rate, entry rate, entries, and exits
- Entry/Exit Analysis for analyzing first or last property values in sessions
- Support for various metrics across session dimensions (uniques, event totals, session totals, PROPSUM)

### Time Spent Analysis
- Measures duration between consecutive events with a 30-minute timeout
- Calculates time spent per user, page, or session
- Requires specific event types (particularly page view events)
- Available on Growth and Enterprise plans

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Metrics
- **Event Segmentation Metrics**: Based on event counts and properties
- **Revenue Metrics**: Focused on monetary values and transactions
- **Formula Metrics**: Custom calculations using other metrics
- **Funnel Metrics**: Tracking user progression through defined steps

### Attribution Terms
- **Attribution Model**: Method for distributing credit across marketing touchpoints
- **Lookback Window**: Time period considered for attribution analysis
- **Touchpoint**: Individual marketing interaction with a user

### Session Metrics
- **Bounce Rate**: Percentage of sessions with only one event
- **Exit Rate**: Percentage of sessions ending with a specific property value
- **Entry Rate**: Percentage of sessions beginning with a specific property value
- **Entries**: Count of sessions beginning with a specific property value
- **Exits**: Count of sessions ending with a specific property value

### Time Spent Analysis
- **TimeSpent(PV)**: Metric measuring duration between consecutive events
- **30-minute Timeout**: Maximum duration considered between events before ending a session

## System Limitations and Behavior

### Row Limits and Sorting
- 100-500 rows displayed for top-level group-bys
- Sorting applies only to displayed results, not the entire dataset
- Export limits vary by metric type:
  - 10,000 rows for event segmentation metrics
  - 300 rows for funnel metrics
  - 100 rows for session metrics
  - 20 rows for attribution metrics

## Integration in Amplitude Ecosystem

Data Tables integrates with other Amplitude features to provide comprehensive analytics capabilities:
- Uses metrics that can be shared across the entire project
- Supports various data sources and event types tracked in Amplitude
- Complements other Amplitude visualization tools with tabular multi-dimensional analysis
- Exports data for use in external systems via CSV or Dashboard REST API

## Usage Examples

### Marketing Attribution
```
1. Create attribution metrics for conversion events
2. Select attribution model (First Touch, Last Touch, etc.)
3. Configure lookback window
4. Group by acquisition channel to see attribution distribution
```

### Content Path Analysis
```
1. Add session metrics (bounce rate, exit rate, entry rate)
2. Group by page or screen name
3. Analyze which pages have high bounce/exit rates
4. Identify optimal entry points based on entry rate
```

### Time Spent Analysis
```
1. Create time spent metrics using TimeSpent(PV)
2. Group by relevant properties (page, user segment)
3. Compare engagement time across different content or user segments
```

### Multi-dimensional Segment Comparison
```
1. Add multiple metrics to columns
2. Group by user segments or properties
3. Optionally add nested group-by for deeper analysis
4. Use transpose feature to switch perspective if needed
```

Data Tables provides a flexible, powerful way to analyze complex relationships in user behavior data, supporting sophisticated analysis needs for marketing, product, and business teams.
