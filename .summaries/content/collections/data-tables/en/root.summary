## Amplitude Data Tables Product Overview

Amplitude Data Tables is a comprehensive multi-dimensional analytics platform that enables advanced data analysis through customizable metrics, attribution modeling, and session-based insights. The product serves as a powerful extension to Amplitude Analytics, providing sophisticated analytical capabilities for marketing attribution, user behavior analysis, and performance measurement across web and mobile applications.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

Data Tables operates as a central hub connecting multiple analytical components:

**Core Metric System**: Data Tables integrates with Event Segmentation charts through reusable metrics that can be shared project-wide. These metrics include Event Segmentation, Revenue, Formula, and Funnel types, with verification capabilities for Growth and Enterprise plans.

**Attribution Engine**: The multi-touch attribution system works seamlessly with Data Tables to provide comprehensive marketing analysis through eight pre-built models (First Touch, Last Touch, Linear, Participation, U-Shaped, J-Shaped, Inverse J-Shaped, and Data Driven using Markov chains) plus custom attribution capabilities.

**Session Analytics**: Session metrics (bounce rate, exit rate, entry rate, entries, exits) integrate with Page View events and custom session definitions, while Entry/Exit Analysis applies session dimensions to various metric types.

**Time Analysis**: Time spent analysis connects with consecutive event tracking and integrates with group-by properties for granular duration measurements.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Metrics**: Reusable analysis objects that can be Event Segmentation, Revenue, Formula, or Funnel types, shareable across projects with verification capabilities.

**Group-by Properties**: Dimensional analysis parameters supporting up to five top-level group-bys with nested secondary group-bys for multi-dimensional segmentation.

**Attribution Models**: Mathematical frameworks for credit distribution across touchpoints, including linear weighting, participation-based, curve-based (U-Shaped, J-Shaped), and machine learning-driven (Data Driven) approaches.

**Session Metrics**: Calculated values based on session boundaries including bounce rate (single-page sessions), entry/exit rates, and session totals using PROPCOUNT of session IDs.

**Active Events**: Events that contribute to session-based calculations and time spent analysis, filtered for non-null property values.

**Lookback Windows**: Configurable time periods for attribution analysis with property value exclusion capabilities.

**TimeSpent Formula**: Custom metric syntax for calculating duration between consecutive events with 30-minute timeout windows and group-by property resets.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Data Tables integrates with several Amplitude ecosystem components:

**Amplitude Analytics**: Serves as the foundational platform providing Event Segmentation charts and core analytical infrastructure.

**Marketing Space**: Leverages UTM source attribution and marketing channel analysis for campaign performance measurement.

**Browser SDK**: Provides Page View event tracking essential for session metrics and time spent analysis.

**Dashboard REST API**: Enables programmatic access with specific row limits (1000 for event segmentation metrics).

**Cohort Creation**: Supports user segmentation based on Data Tables analysis results with CSV export capabilities.

## Technical Specifications and Limits

**Result Limits**: 100 rows for single group-by analysis, 500 for multiple group-by, 20 for attribution metrics.

**Export Capabilities**: CSV export with varying limits - 10,000 rows for event segmentation, 300 for funnel metrics, 100 for session metrics, 20 for attribution analysis.

**API Integration**: Dashboard REST API supports up to 1000 rows for event segmentation metrics.

**Plan Requirements**: Session metrics and advanced features require Growth or Enterprise plans.

**Processing Logic**: Sorting reorders existing results without fetching new data, maintaining performance while providing flexible data presentation options.

The platform supports both absolute numbers and relative percentage analysis with visual enhancements including data bars, color coding, and period-over-period comparisons, while maintaining read-only status for transposed table configurations.
