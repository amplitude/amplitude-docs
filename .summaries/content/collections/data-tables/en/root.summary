## Amplitude Data Tables Product Overview

Amplitude Data Tables is a comprehensive multi-dimensional analytics feature within Amplitude Analytics that enables users to create sophisticated tabular reports combining multiple metrics, group-by properties, and advanced analytical models. The product serves as a powerful complement to Event Segmentation charts, providing deeper insights into user behavior, marketing attribution, session analysis, and content performance through flexible data visualization and manipulation capabilities.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

Data Tables operates as a central hub connecting several Amplitude Analytics components:

**Core Integration Points:**
- **Event Segmentation Charts**: Data Tables can utilize metrics created in Event Segmentation and vice versa, with shared metric definitions across both visualization types
- **Reusable Metrics System**: Users can create project-wide metrics (Event Segmentation, Revenue, Formula, Funnels) that work seamlessly across Data Tables and other chart types
- **User Segments and Cohorts**: Data Tables can generate cohorts from analysis results and apply existing user segments as filters
- **Dashboard REST API**: Provides programmatic access to Data Tables results with configurable row limits

**Specialized Analysis Modules:**
- **Multi-Touch Attribution**: Integrates 9 pre-built attribution models plus custom configurations for marketing analysis
- **Session Metrics**: Dedicated session-based calculations (bounce rate, exit rate, entry rate) for content path analysis
- **Entry/Exit Analysis**: Session dimension analysis applying first/last property values to various metric types
- **Time Spent Analysis**: Duration calculations between consecutive events with configurable timeout windows

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Metric Types:**
- **Event Segmentation Metrics**: Standard event counting and unique user metrics
- **Revenue Metrics**: Financial performance measurements
- **Formula Metrics**: Custom calculated metrics using mathematical expressions
- **Funnel Metrics**: Conversion analysis metrics
- **Session Totals**: Session-based aggregations
- **PROPSUM**: Property value summation metrics

**Attribution Models:**
- **First Touch/Last Touch**: Single-point attribution to initial or final touchpoints
- **Linear Attribution**: Equal credit distribution across all touchpoints
- **Participation Attribution**: Full credit to all contributing touchpoints
- **U-Shaped/J-Shaped/Inverse J-Shaped**: Weighted attribution models emphasizing different touchpoint positions
- **Data Driven Attribution**: Machine learning-based attribution using Markov chains
- **Lookback Window**: Time period for considering attribution touchpoints

**Analysis Dimensions:**
- **Group-by Properties**: Categorical dimensions for data segmentation
- **Nested Group-by**: Multi-level property hierarchies
- **Time Properties**: Temporal dimensions with special handling for row multiplication
- **Active Events**: Events contributing to session-based calculations

**Session Terminology:**
- **Bounce Rate**: Single-page session percentage
- **Entry/Exit Rate**: Session start/end percentages for specific properties
- **Session Entries/Exits**: Count of sessions beginning/ending with specific events
- **30-Minute Timeout**: Standard session boundary definition

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Data Tables functions within Amplitude's comprehensive analytics ecosystem:

**Plan-Based Feature Access:**
- Growth and Enterprise plans provide access to advanced features like session metrics, time spent analysis, and enhanced attribution models
- Role-based permissions control metric verification, deletion, and administrative functions

**Data Processing Architecture:**
- Integrates with Browser SDK for Page View event tracking
- Supports custom event definitions alongside primitive Amplitude events
- Processes data through specialized calculation engines for different metric types

**Export and API Capabilities:**
- CSV export functionality with metric-specific row limits (100-10,000 rows)
- Dashboard REST API integration for programmatic access
- Configurable display options including relative percentages, data bars, and color-coded deltas

## Technical Implementation Details

**Result Limitations:**
- Display limits: 100-500 rows depending on metric type
- CSV export limits: 20-10,000 rows based on metric complexity
- Time properties as group-bys can multiply row limits through period expansion

**Sorting and Data Manipulation:**
- Sorting reorders existing results without fetching additional data
- Transpose functionality for rows/columns interchange
- Period-over-period comparison capabilities with specialized sorting logic

**Attribution Configuration:**
- Custom lookback windows for attribution analysis
- UTM source and campaign attribution support
- Channel-based attribution weighting across different metric types

**Session Analysis Processing:**
- Entry/Exit semantics apply first/last property values from active events
- Time spent calculations use consecutive event duration with timeout handling
- Group-by property resets enable granular time analysis per dimension

The Data Tables product represents Amplitude's solution for complex, multi-dimensional analytics that bridges the gap between simple event tracking and sophisticated business intelligence, providing marketers, product managers, and analysts with powerful tools for understanding user behavior patterns and optimizing business outcomes.
