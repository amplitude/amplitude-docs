# Amplitude Data Tables Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude Data Tables is an advanced analytics feature that enables multi-dimensional analysis of user behavior data. It allows users to compare multiple metrics across different dimensions in a single view, providing a comprehensive way to analyze complex data relationships. Data Tables is primarily available on Amplitude's Growth and Enterprise plans and serves as a powerful tool for marketing attribution, segment analysis, and experiment analysis.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Multi-Dimensional Analysis
- Compare multiple metrics across different dimensions in a single view
- Group data by various properties with nested group-by capabilities
- Transpose rows and columns for different visualization perspectives
- Apply filters to focus analysis on specific segments

### Metrics System
- Create reusable analysis objects that can be shared project-wide
- Four metric types: Event Segmentation, Revenue, Formula, and Funnel
- Metrics can be designated as "official" by managers and administrators
- Any member can create metrics, but only managers/admins can make them official

### Attribution Modeling
- Attribute credit to multiple marketing touch points
- Pre-built attribution models: First Touch, Last Touch, Linear, Participation, U-Shaped, J-Shaped, Inverse J-Shaped, and Data Driven
- Custom attribution models with specific weighting distributions
- Configurable lookback windows for attribution analysis

### Session Analysis
- Session metrics: bounce rate, exit rate, entry rate, entries, exits
- Entry/Exit Analysis for analyzing first or last property values in sessions
- Time Spent Analysis for measuring duration between consecutive events
- 30-minute timeout for session calculations

## Product Relationships and Ecosystem

Data Tables integrates with the broader Amplitude Analytics platform in several ways:

1. **Metrics System**: Metrics created in Data Tables are reusable across the Amplitude platform and can be shared project-wide.

2. **Dashboard Integration**: Data Tables charts can be added to Amplitude dashboards and accessed via the Dashboard REST API.

3. **Export Capabilities**: Results from Data Tables can be exported with varying limits based on metric types.

4. **Plan Tiers**: Most advanced features require Growth or Enterprise plans, with some basic functionality available on all plans.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Group-by Properties**: Dimensions used to segment data in Data Tables
- **Nested Group-by**: Hierarchical organization of dimensions for more detailed analysis
- **Attribution Models**: Methods for distributing credit across multiple marketing touchpoints
- **Lookback Window**: Time period considered for attribution analysis
- **Bounce Rate**: Percentage of sessions with only one page view
- **Exit Rate**: Percentage of sessions that end on a specific page
- **Entry Rate**: Percentage of sessions that begin on a specific page
- **Time Spent Analysis**: Measurement of duration between consecutive events with a 30-minute timeout

## Technical Specifications

### Row Limits and Sorting Logic
- 100-500 rows displayed for top-level group-bys
- Sorting applied only to displayed results
- Export limits vary by metric type:
  - Event segmentation: 10,000 rows
  - Funnels: 300 rows
  - Sessions: 100 rows
  - Attribution metrics: 20 rows

### Time Spent Analysis Configuration
- Measures duration between consecutive events
- 30-minute timeout for session calculations
- Group-by property reset when property value changes
- Supports page view events and other event types

### Entry/Exit Analysis Processing
- Identifies relevant sessions based on criteria
- Extracts first or last property value in each session
- Supports metrics like uniques, event totals, session totals, and PROPSUM

## Use Cases

1. **Marketing Attribution**: Analyze the effectiveness of different marketing channels using various attribution models.

2. **Segment Analysis**: Compare performance metrics across different user segments.

3. **Experiment Analysis**: Evaluate the impact of experiments on multiple metrics simultaneously.

4. **Content Path Analysis**: Use session metrics to understand how users navigate through content.

5. **Engagement Analysis**: Measure time spent on different pages to optimize user experience.
