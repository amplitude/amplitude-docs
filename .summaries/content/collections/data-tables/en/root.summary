## Amplitude Data Tables Product Overview

Amplitude Data Tables is a comprehensive multi-dimensional analytics platform that enables sophisticated data analysis through flexible metric creation, attribution modeling, and session-based insights. The product serves as a powerful complement to Event Segmentation charts, providing tabular data visualization with advanced grouping, filtering, and analytical capabilities for Growth and Enterprise plan users.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

Data Tables operates as a central hub connecting multiple analytical frameworks within Amplitude Analytics:

**Core Metric Types Integration:**
- Event Segmentation metrics for basic event counting and user analysis
- Revenue metrics for financial performance tracking
- Formula metrics enabling custom calculations using TimeSpent(PV) and other mathematical operations
- Funnel metrics for conversion analysis
- Session metrics (bounce rate, exit rate, entry rate, entries, exits) for content path analysis

**Attribution Framework:**
The multi-touch attribution system integrates seamlessly with data tables, supporting eight pre-built models (First Touch, Last Touch, Linear, Participation, U-Shaped, J-Shaped, Inverse J-Shaped, Data Driven using Markov chains) plus custom attribution models with configurable lookback windows and weighting schemes for UTM source and marketing channel analysis.

**Session Analytics Integration:**
Entry/Exit Analysis and Time Spent Analysis work in conjunction to provide comprehensive session-based insights, with Entry/Exit applying first/last session dimensions to metrics while Time Spent calculates duration between consecutive events with 30-minute timeout windows.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Group-by Properties:** Primary dimensional analysis mechanism supporting nested breakdowns with specific constraints when time dimensions are involved, multiplying row limits and enabling transpose functionality for flexible data visualization.

**Active Events:** Events processed within the computation flow for Entry/Exit Analysis, specifically those with non-null property values used to extract first/last session dimensions.

**Session Totals vs PROPCOUNT:** Distinct calculation methodologies where Session Totals aggregate at the session level while PROPCOUNT operates on individual event properties.

**Lookback Window:** Configurable time period for attribution analysis determining how far back to consider touchpoints in the customer journey.

**Metric Verification/Officiation:** Administrative process for validating and approving metrics for project-wide sharing, requiring Manager or Admin permissions.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Data Tables functions as a bridge between raw event data and actionable business insights within the Amplitude ecosystem:

**Browser SDK Integration:** Leverages Page View events from the Browser SDK for time spent calculations and session analysis, supporting both primitive page view events and custom [Amplitude] Page View events.

**Dashboard REST API:** Provides programmatic access with specific row limits (20-10,000 for CSV exports) and metric type restrictions for automated reporting and data extraction.

**Marketing Analytics:** Integrates with UTM tracking and marketing channel attribution for comprehensive campaign performance analysis across multiple touchpoints.

**Project-Wide Sharing:** Enables metric standardization across teams through centralized metric creation and role-based permission management.

## Technical Specifications and Limitations

**Result Limits:**
- Display: 100-500 rows depending on metric type
- CSV Export: 20-10,000 rows based on metric complexity
- Time properties as group-bys multiply these limits
- Nested group-by configurations have specific row restrictions

**Sorting Logic:** Operates on existing result sets without fetching additional data, maintaining performance while providing flexible data organization.

**Session Timeout:** 30-minute window for time spent calculations with automatic session boundary detection and bounce session handling that excludes last page view events.

**Attribution Processing:** Supports custom weighting schemes and multiple model comparison with event totals, property sum, and conversion attribution across acquisition touchpoints.

The platform emphasizes reusable metric creation, multi-dimensional analysis flexibility, and comprehensive session-based insights while maintaining performance through intelligent result limiting and processing optimization.
