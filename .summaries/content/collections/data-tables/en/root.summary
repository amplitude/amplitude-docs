Amplitude Data Tables is a comprehensive multi-dimensional analytics feature that enables users to create sophisticated tabular reports with multiple metrics, group-by properties, and advanced attribution modeling capabilities. The product serves as a powerful complement to Event Segmentation charts, providing deeper analytical insights through customizable table formats and specialized metric calculations.

## Core Features and Capabilities

Data Tables supports multiple metric types including Event Segmentation metrics, Revenue metrics, Formula metrics, Funnels metrics, and specialized session-based metrics. Users can create reusable metrics that are shared project-wide and can be verified by managers and administrators on Growth and Enterprise plans. The platform enables multi-metric analysis with nested group-by properties, transpose functionality for rows and columns, and period-over-period comparisons.

Key analytical capabilities include multi-touch attribution with eight pre-built models (First Touch, Last Touch, Linear, Participation, U-Shaped, J-Shaped, Inverse J-Shaped, and Data Driven using Markov chains), custom attribution models with configurable lookback windows, and specialized session metrics for content path analysis. The system supports Entry/Exit Analysis for extracting first/last property values from sessions and time spent analysis with 30-minute timeout windows between consecutive events.

## Product Relationships and Integration

Data Tables integrates seamlessly with Amplitude's broader analytics ecosystem, sharing metrics with Event Segmentation charts and supporting cohort creation from table results. The feature connects with the Browser SDK for Page View event tracking and integrates with Marketing Space for campaign performance analysis. Users can export results via CSV or access data programmatically through the Dashboard REST API.

The attribution functionality specifically targets acquisition touchpoints and UTM source analysis, while session metrics leverage Page View events (both primitive `[Amplitude] Page View` and custom implementations) for bounce rate, exit rate, entry rate calculations, and session totals analysis.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Attribution Models**: Pre-built algorithms for distributing conversion credit across multiple touchpoints, including linear weighting, participation-based models, and data-driven Markov chain approaches.

**Group-by Properties**: Dimensional attributes used to segment data, supporting both top-level and nested configurations that can multiply result limits when time properties are included.

**Session Metrics**: Specialized calculations including bounce rate (single-page sessions), exit rate, entry rate, entries, and exits based on Page View events and session boundaries.

**Entry/Exit Analysis**: Feature applying session dimensions to extract first or last property values from active events within user sessions.

**Time Spent Analysis**: Duration calculations between consecutive events with automatic timeout handling and group-by property reset capabilities.

**Metric Types**: Core measurement categories including Uniques, Event totals, Session totals, PROPSUM, and PROPCOUNT with specific processing flows and limitations.

## System Architecture and Constraints

Data Tables operates with specific result limits: 100-500 rows for display and 20-10,000 rows for CSV exports depending on metric type. Sorting functionality reorders existing results without fetching additional data. Time properties as group-bys can multiply row limits, while nested group-by configurations have their own scaling considerations.

The attribution system supports configurable lookback windows and weighting schemes, with custom attribution models available alongside pre-built options. Session-based calculations require proper Page View event implementation and respect custom session definitions when configured.

Formula metrics enable custom calculations using expressions like `TimeSpent(PV)` divided by `Uniques(PV)` for average time spent per user, while the system automatically handles bounce session behavior by excluding last page views from time calculations.
