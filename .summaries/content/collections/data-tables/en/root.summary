## Amplitude Data Tables Product Overview

Amplitude Data Tables is a comprehensive multi-dimensional analytics platform that enables advanced data analysis through customizable metrics, attribution modeling, and session-based insights. The product serves as a powerful extension to Amplitude Analytics, providing sophisticated analytical capabilities for marketing attribution, user behavior analysis, and conversion optimization.

## Product Features and Relationships

**Core Analytics Engine**
Data Tables centers around creating and analyzing custom metrics across multiple dimensions. The platform supports four primary metric types: Event Segmentation, Revenue, Formula, and Funnels. These metrics can be combined with up to five top-level group-by properties and nested secondary group-bys to create complex multi-dimensional analyses.

**Attribution Analysis Framework**
The attribution system provides eight pre-built models (First Touch, Last Touch, Linear, Participation, U-Shaped, J-Shaped, Inverse J-Shaped, and Data Driven using Markov chains) plus custom attribution model creation. This framework integrates with UTM source tracking and supports configurable lookback windows with property value exclusions for precise marketing channel analysis.

**Session Analytics Suite**
Session metrics (bounce rate, exit rate, entry rate, entries, exits) work in conjunction with Entry/Exit Analysis to provide comprehensive user journey insights. The Time Spent Analysis feature calculates duration between consecutive events using a 30-minute timeout window, enabling detailed engagement measurement.

**Data Management and Export**
The platform includes robust data handling with specific limits for different analysis types and comprehensive CSV export capabilities with the Dashboard REST API supporting programmatic access.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Metrics and Dimensions**
- **Reusable Metrics**: Project-wide shared analysis objects that can be verified/officiated by managers and administrators
- **Group-by Properties**: Dimensional attributes used to segment data, supporting both top-level and nested configurations
- **Active Events**: Events that contribute to session-based calculations and time spent analysis
- **Attribution Touch Points**: Marketing interaction points used in multi-touch attribution modeling

**Session Concepts**
- **Session Totals**: Aggregate metrics calculated at the session level using PROPCOUNT of session IDs
- **Entry/Exit Semantics**: First and last property values extracted from active events within sessions
- **Bounce Rate**: Single-page sessions calculated based on Page View events and group-by properties

**Attribution Models**
- **Data Driven Attribution**: Advanced modeling using Markov chains for probabilistic attribution
- **Lookback Window**: Configurable time period for attribution analysis
- **Custom Attribution Models**: User-defined attribution logic with specific weighting and exclusion rules

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Data Tables operates as a central analytics hub within the broader Amplitude ecosystem, specifically designed for Growth and Enterprise plan users. The platform integrates with:

**Amplitude Analytics Core**: Extends Event Segmentation charts with advanced multi-dimensional capabilities and custom metric creation

**Marketing Analytics**: Provides specialized UTM source attribution and marketing channel analysis through the Marketing Space integration

**Browser SDK Integration**: Leverages Page View events and custom session definitions for web analytics

**Dashboard and API Layer**: Supports programmatic access through the Dashboard REST API with 1000-row limits for automated reporting and data integration

## Technical Specifications and Limits

**Analysis Limits**
- Single group-by: 100 results
- Multiple group-by: 500 results

**Formula Syntax**
The platform supports TimeSpent formula syntax for custom time-based metrics, with automatic group-by property resets and session bounce behavior handling.

**Data Processing**
Time spent calculations use consecutive event duration with 30-minute timeout windows, while attribution models support various weighting schemes across acquisition touchpoints with configurable property value exclusions.
