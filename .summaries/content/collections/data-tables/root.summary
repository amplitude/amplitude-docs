Amplitude Data Tables is a multi-dimensional analytics platform that transforms event data into sophisticated tabular reports with advanced attribution modeling and session analysis capabilities. The product extends beyond traditional event segmentation by offering customizable table formats, multiple metric types, and specialized analytical functions for comprehensive user behavior analysis.

## Core Product Architecture

Data Tables operates as a metric-driven analytics engine supporting five primary metric categories: Event Segmentation metrics, Revenue metrics, Formula metrics, Funnels metrics, and session-based metrics. The platform enables multi-metric analysis through reusable, project-wide metrics that can be verified by managers and administrators on Growth and Enterprise plans. Users can configure nested group-by properties with transpose functionality and perform period-over-period comparisons across dimensional attributes.

The system processes data through configurable result limits ranging from 100-500 rows for display and 20-10,000 rows for CSV exports, with sorting capabilities that reorder existing results without additional data fetching. Time properties used as group-by dimensions can multiply row limits, requiring careful consideration of nested group-by configurations and their scaling implications.

## Attribution Modeling Framework

Data Tables features a comprehensive multi-touch attribution system with eight pre-built models: First Touch, Last Touch, Linear, Participation, U-Shaped, J-Shaped, Inverse J-Shaped, and Data Driven using Markov chains. The attribution engine supports custom models with configurable lookback windows and weighting schemes, specifically targeting acquisition touchpoints and UTM source analysis for marketing campaign performance evaluation.

Attribution models distribute conversion credit across multiple touchpoints using various algorithms - linear weighting provides equal distribution, participation-based models assign binary credit, while data-driven Markov chain approaches use probabilistic calculations to determine touchpoint influence on conversion paths.

## Session Analytics and Content Path Analysis

The platform implements specialized session metrics leveraging Page View events (both primitive `[Amplitude] Page View` and custom implementations) for bounce rate, exit rate, entry rate calculations, and session totals analysis. Session boundaries are defined with 30-minute timeout windows between consecutive events, with automatic handling of session definitions when custom configurations are applied.

Entry/Exit Analysis applies session dimensions to extract first or last property values from active events within user sessions, enabling content path optimization and user journey analysis. Time Spent Analysis calculates durations between consecutive events with automatic timeout handling and group-by property reset capabilities, supporting formula expressions like `TimeSpent(PV)` divided by `Uniques(PV)` for average time spent per user calculations.

## Integration Ecosystem and API Access

Data Tables integrates seamlessly with Amplitude's analytics ecosystem, sharing metrics with Event Segmentation charts and enabling cohort creation from table results. The platform connects with the Browser SDK for Page View event tracking and integrates with Marketing Space for campaign performance analysis across acquisition channels.

Users can export analytical results via CSV downloads or access data programmatically through the Dashboard REST API, enabling automated reporting workflows and custom dashboard integrations. The system supports both manual analysis through the web interface and programmatic data extraction for enterprise analytics pipelines.

## Key Terminology and Metric Definitions

**Metric Types** encompass core measurement categories including Uniques (distinct user counts), Event totals (occurrence frequencies), Session totals (session-based aggregations), PROPSUM (property value summations), and PROPCOUNT (property occurrence counts), each with specific processing flows and computational limitations.

**Group-by Properties** serve as dimensional attributes for data segmentation, supporting both top-level and nested configurations that enable multi-dimensional analysis while respecting system constraints on result multiplication when time properties are included.

**Session Metrics** include bounce rate calculations (single-page sessions), exit rates, entry rates, entries, and exits based on Page View events and session boundary definitions, with specialized handling for bounce session behavior that excludes last page views from time calculations.

**Formula Metrics** enable custom calculations using mathematical expressions combining multiple metric types, supporting complex analytical scenarios like average session duration, conversion rates, and custom KPI calculations through configurable formula syntax.
