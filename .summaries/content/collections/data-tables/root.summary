# Amplitude Data Tables Product Overview

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude Data Tables is an advanced analytics feature that enables multi-dimensional analysis of user behavior data. Available primarily on Amplitude's Growth and Enterprise plans, it allows users to compare multiple metrics across different dimensions in a single view. The product excels at marketing attribution, segment analysis, and experiment analysis by providing a comprehensive tabular interface for analyzing complex data relationships.

## Key Features and Capabilities

### Multi-Dimensional Analysis
- Compare multiple metrics across different dimensions simultaneously
- Apply hierarchical organization with group-by properties
- Support nested group-by properties for deeper analysis
- Transpose rows and columns for different visualization perspectives
- Apply filters to focus on specific data segments

### Metrics System
- Create and share reusable analysis objects (metrics) project-wide
- Four supported metric types:
  - Event Segmentation: Based on event counts and properties
  - Revenue: Focused on monetary values and transactions
  - Formula: Custom calculations using other metrics
  - Funnel: Tracking user progression through defined steps
- Official designation capability for verified metrics (restricted to managers/admins)

### Attribution Analysis
- Multiple attribution models for marketing touchpoint credit:
  - First Touch: 100% credit to first touchpoint
  - Last Touch: 100% credit to last touchpoint
  - Linear: Equal credit across all touchpoints
  - Participation: 100% credit to each touchpoint
  - U-Shaped: 40% first, 40% last, 20% middle touchpoints
  - J-Shaped: 20% first, 60% last, 20% middle touchpoints
  - Inverse J-Shaped: 60% first, 20% last, 20% middle touchpoints
  - Data Driven: Uses Markov Chain modeling for algorithmic attribution
- Custom attribution models with specific weighting distributions
- Configurable lookback windows for attribution analysis

### Session Analysis
- Session-specific metrics including:
  - Bounce rate: Percentage of sessions with only one event
  - Exit rate: Percentage of sessions ending with a specific property value
  - Entry rate: Percentage of sessions beginning with a specific property value
  - Entries: Count of sessions beginning with a specific property value
  - Exits: Count of sessions ending with a specific property value
- Entry/Exit Analysis for analyzing first or last property values in sessions

### Time Spent Analysis
- Measures duration between consecutive events with a 30-minute timeout
- Calculates time spent per user, page, or session
- Requires specific event types (particularly page view events)

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Metrics
Reusable analysis objects that can be shared across a project. The four types (Event Segmentation, Revenue, Formula, and Funnel) serve different analytical purposes.

### Attribution Terms
- **Attribution Model**: Method for distributing credit across marketing touchpoints
- **Lookback Window**: Time period considered for attribution analysis
- **Touchpoint**: Individual marketing interaction with a user

### Session Metrics
Specialized metrics that analyze user sessions, including bounce rate, exit rate, entry rate, entries, and exits.

### Time Spent Analysis
- **TimeSpent(PV)**: Metric measuring duration between consecutive events
- **30-minute Timeout**: Maximum duration considered between events before ending a session

## Integration in Amplitude Ecosystem

Data Tables integrates with the broader Amplitude platform by:
- Using metrics that can be shared across the entire project
- Supporting various data sources and event types tracked in Amplitude
- Complementing other Amplitude visualization tools with tabular multi-dimensional analysis
- Exporting data for use in external systems via CSV or Dashboard REST API

## System Limitations and Behavior

### Row Limits and Sorting
- 100-500 rows displayed for top-level group-bys
- Sorting applies only to displayed results, not the entire dataset
- Export limits vary by metric type:
  - 10,000 rows for event segmentation metrics
  - 300 rows for funnel metrics
  - 100 rows for session metrics
  - 20 rows for attribution metrics

## Usage Examples

### Marketing Attribution
```
1. Create attribution metrics for conversion events
2. Select attribution model (First Touch, Last Touch, etc.)
3. Configure lookback window
4. Group by acquisition channel to see attribution distribution
```

### Content Path Analysis
```
1. Add session metrics (bounce rate, exit rate, entry rate)
2. Group by page or screen name
3. Analyze which pages have high bounce/exit rates
4. Identify optimal entry points based on entry rate
```

### Time Spent Analysis
```
1. Create time spent metrics using TimeSpent(PV)
2. Group by relevant properties (page, user segment)
3. Compare engagement time across different content or user segments
```

### Multi-dimensional Segment Comparison
```
1. Add multiple metrics to columns
2. Group by user segments or properties
3. Optionally add nested group-by for deeper analysis
4. Use transpose feature to switch perspective if needed
