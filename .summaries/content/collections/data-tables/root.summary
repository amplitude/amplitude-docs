# Amplitude Data Tables

## Product Overview

Amplitude Data Tables is an advanced analytics feature that enables multi-dimensional analysis of user behavior data. It allows users to compare multiple metrics across different dimensions in a single view, providing a comprehensive way to analyze marketing attribution, session metrics, time spent, and entry/exit patterns. This feature is primarily available on Amplitude's Growth and Enterprise plans, offering a flexible tabular interface for complex data analysis.

## Key Features and Concepts

### Multi-Dimensional Analysis
- Compare multiple metrics across different dimensions in a single view
- Apply group-by properties to segment data
- Support for nested group-by properties for hierarchical analysis
- Transpose feature to switch rows and columns for different visualization perspectives
- Filtering capabilities to focus on specific segments

### Metrics System
- Reusable analysis objects that can be created by any member, manager, or admin
- Only managers and administrators can designate metrics as "official"
- Four types of metrics:
  - Event Segmentation metrics
  - Revenue metrics
  - Formula metrics
  - Funnel metrics
- Metrics can be configured for specific visualization in Data Tables

### Attribution Modeling
- Multi-touch attribution to credit multiple marketing touchpoints
- Pre-built attribution models:
  - First Touch: 100% credit to first touchpoint
  - Last Touch: 100% credit to last touchpoint
  - Linear: Equal credit across all touchpoints
  - Participation: 100% credit to each touchpoint
  - U-Shaped: 40% to first, 40% to last, 20% distributed among middle touchpoints
  - J-Shaped: 20% to first, 60% to last, 20% distributed among middle touchpoints
  - Inverse J-Shaped: 60% to first, 20% to last, 20% distributed among middle touchpoints
  - Data Driven (Markov Chain): Algorithmic attribution
- Custom attribution models with configurable lookback windows

### Session Metrics
- Bounce rate: Percentage of single-page sessions
- Exit rate: Percentage of sessions that end on a specific page
- Entry rate: Percentage of sessions that begin on a specific page
- Entries: Count of sessions that begin on a specific page
- Exits: Count of sessions that end on a specific page

### Entry/Exit Analysis
- Analyze data based on first (entry) or last (exit) property value in a session
- Supports metrics like uniques, event totals, session totals, and PROPSUM
- Extracts first or last non-null property value from active events in sessions

### Time Spent Analysis
- Calculates time between consecutive events with a 30-minute timeout
- Supports primitive page views, filtered events, and custom events
- Available metrics include total time spent and time per user/page/session
- TimeSpent(PV) metric for page view analysis

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Group-by properties**: Dimensions used to segment data in Data Tables
- **Nested group-by**: Hierarchical organization of dimensions for more detailed analysis
- **Lookback window**: Time period considered for attribution analysis
- **Bounce rate**: Percentage of single-page sessions
- **Exit rate**: Percentage of sessions ending on a specific page
- **Entry rate**: Percentage of sessions beginning on a specific page
- **Attribution model**: Method for distributing credit across marketing touchpoints
- **Metrics**: Reusable analysis objects that define what to measure
- **TimeSpent(PV)**: Metric for analyzing time spent between page views
- **PROPSUM**: Property sum calculation for quantitative analysis
- **PROPCOUNT**: Property count calculation

## Row Limits and Data Handling

- Display limits:
  - 100-500 rows for top-level group-bys
  - Sorting only applies to displayed results
- Export limits vary by metric type:
  - 10,000 rows for event segmentation
  - 300 rows for funnels
  - 100 rows for sessions
  - 20 rows for attribution metrics
- Dashboard REST API has its own limits

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Data Tables integrates with the broader Amplitude Analytics platform, serving as an advanced analysis tool that complements other Amplitude features:

- Uses metrics that can be shared across the entire project
- Leverages user properties and event data collected by Amplitude
- Supports export to CSV for further analysis in external tools
- Can be added to Amplitude dashboards for regular monitoring
- Works with Amplitude's session tracking capabilities
- Utilizes Amplitude's user identification system for user-level analysis

Data Tables represents Amplitude's solution for complex, multi-dimensional data analysis, allowing users to go beyond basic charts to discover deeper insights about user behavior, marketing effectiveness, and content performance.
