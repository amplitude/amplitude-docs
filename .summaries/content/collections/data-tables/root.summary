Amplitude Data Tables is a sophisticated multi-dimensional analytics platform that extends Amplitude Analytics with advanced data analysis capabilities through customizable metrics, attribution modeling, and session-based insights. The platform serves as a comprehensive solution for marketing attribution, user behavior analysis, and performance measurement across web and mobile applications.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

Data Tables functions as a central analytical hub orchestrating multiple interconnected components:

**Metric System Architecture**: The platform integrates with Event Segmentation charts through a reusable metrics framework that enables project-wide sharing. Metrics encompass Event Segmentation, Revenue, Formula, and Funnel types, with verification capabilities available for Growth and Enterprise plans. These metrics serve as building blocks for complex analytical workflows.

**Attribution Engine Integration**: The multi-touch attribution system seamlessly connects with Data Tables to deliver comprehensive marketing analysis through eight pre-built models: First Touch, Last Touch, Linear, Participation, U-Shaped, J-Shaped, Inverse J-Shaped, and Data Driven (utilizing Markov chains). Custom attribution capabilities extend beyond these standard models for specialized use cases.

**Session Analytics Framework**: Session metrics including bounce rate, exit rate, entry rate, entries, and exits integrate with Page View events and custom session definitions. The Entry/Exit Analysis feature applies session dimensions across various metric types, creating a unified session-based analytical approach.

**Temporal Analysis Components**: Time spent analysis connects with consecutive event tracking and integrates with group-by properties for granular duration measurements, enabling detailed user engagement analysis.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Metrics**: Reusable analytical objects categorized as Event Segmentation, Revenue, Formula, or Funnel types. These can be shared across projects and include verification capabilities for data quality assurance.

**Group-by Properties**: Dimensional analysis parameters supporting up to five top-level group-bys with nested secondary group-bys, enabling sophisticated multi-dimensional segmentation and analysis.

**Attribution Models**: Mathematical frameworks for distributing credit across customer touchpoints, including linear weighting, participation-based models, curve-based approaches (U-Shaped, J-Shaped), and machine learning-driven Data Driven models using Markov chain analysis.

**Session Metrics**: Calculated values derived from session boundaries, including bounce rate (single-page sessions), entry/exit rates, and session totals computed using PROPCOUNT of session IDs.

**Active Events**: Events that qualify for session-based calculations and time spent analysis, filtered to exclude null property values and ensure data integrity.

**Lookback Windows**: Configurable time periods for attribution analysis with property value exclusion capabilities, allowing for precise temporal scoping of analytical queries.

**TimeSpent Formula**: Custom metric syntax for calculating duration between consecutive events, incorporating 30-minute timeout windows and group-by property resets for accurate engagement measurement.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Data Tables integrates comprehensively within the Amplitude ecosystem:

**Amplitude Analytics Foundation**: Leverages the core platform's Event Segmentation charts and analytical infrastructure while extending capabilities through advanced multi-dimensional analysis.

**Marketing Analytics Integration**: Connects with Marketing Space for UTM source attribution and marketing channel analysis, enabling comprehensive campaign performance measurement and optimization.

**Data Collection Layer**: Integrates with Browser SDK for Page View event tracking, which is essential for session metrics and time spent analysis functionality.

**API and Export Systems**: Interfaces with the Dashboard REST API for programmatic access and supports cohort creation based on analysis results with comprehensive CSV export capabilities.

## Technical Specifications and API Endpoints
