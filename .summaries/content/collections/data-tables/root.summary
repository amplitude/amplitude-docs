# Amplitude Data Tables Product Overview

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude Data Tables is an advanced analytics feature that enables multi-dimensional analysis of user behavior data. It allows users to compare multiple metrics across different dimensions in a single view, providing a comprehensive way to analyze complex data relationships. The product is primarily designed for marketing attribution, segment analysis, and experiment analysis, and is available on Amplitude's Growth and Enterprise plans.

## Product Relationships and Features

Data Tables functions as a core analytical component within the Amplitude Analytics platform with the following key features:

1. **Multi-Dimensional Analysis**
   - Compares multiple metrics across different dimensions simultaneously
   - Supports nested group-by capabilities for hierarchical data organization
   - Allows transposition of rows and columns for different visualization perspectives
   - Includes filtering capabilities to focus on specific segments

2. **Metrics System**
   - Creates reusable analysis objects shareable across the entire project
   - Supports four metric types: Event Segmentation, Revenue, Formula, and Funnel
   - Implements an "official" designation system for metrics (managed by administrators)
   - Enables any member to create metrics while restricting official designation to managers/admins

3. **Attribution Modeling**
   - Attributes credit to multiple marketing touch points using various models
   - Includes pre-built models: First Touch, Last Touch, Linear, Participation, U-Shaped, J-Shaped, Inverse J-Shaped, and Data Driven
   - Supports custom attribution models with specific weighting distributions
   - Offers configurable lookback windows for attribution analysis

4. **Session Analysis**
   - Provides session metrics including bounce rate, exit rate, entry rate, entries, and exits
   - Supports Entry/Exit Analysis for analyzing first or last property values in sessions
   - Enables Time Spent Analysis for measuring duration between consecutive events
   - Uses a 30-minute timeout for session calculations

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Group-by Properties**: Dimensions used to segment data in Data Tables
- **Nested Group-by**: Hierarchical organization of dimensions for more detailed analysis
- **Attribution Models**: Methods for distributing credit across multiple marketing touchpoints
- **Lookback Window**: Time period considered for attribution analysis
- **Bounce Rate**: Percentage of sessions with only one page view
- **Exit Rate**: Percentage of sessions that end on a specific page
- **Entry Rate**: Percentage of sessions that begin on a specific page
- **Time Spent Analysis**: Measurement of duration between consecutive events with a 30-minute timeout

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Data Tables integrates with the broader Amplitude Analytics platform in several ways:

1. **Metrics System Integration**: Metrics created in Data Tables are reusable across the Amplitude platform and can be shared project-wide, creating a consistent analytical framework.

2. **Dashboard Integration**: Data Tables charts can be added to Amplitude dashboards and accessed via the Dashboard REST API, enabling visualization and sharing of complex analyses.

3. **Export Capabilities**: Results from Data Tables can be exported with varying limits based on metric types:
   - Event segmentation: 10,000 rows
   - Funnels: 300 rows
   - Sessions: 100 rows
   - Attribution metrics: 20 rows

4. **Plan Tier Integration**: Most advanced features require Growth or Enterprise plans, with some basic functionality available on all plans, aligning with Amplitude's overall product tier structure.

## Technical Specifications

### Row Limits and Sorting Logic
- 100-500 rows displayed for top-level group-bys
- Sorting applied only to displayed results
- Export limits vary by metric type as detailed above

### Time Spent Analysis Configuration
- Measures duration between consecutive events
- 30-minute timeout for session calculations
- Group-by property reset when property value changes
- Supports page view events and other event types

### Entry/Exit Analysis Processing
- Identifies relevant sessions based on criteria
- Extracts first or last property value in each session
- Supports metrics like uniques, event totals, session totals, and PROPSUM

Data Tables serves as a powerful analytical tool within Amplitude's ecosystem, enabling users to perform complex multi-dimensional analyses of user behavior data with flexible visualization options and integration with other Amplitude features.
