Amplitude Data Tables is a sophisticated multi-dimensional analytics platform that serves as a comprehensive tabular data visualization and analysis tool within the Amplitude Analytics ecosystem. Available to Growth and Enterprise plan users, it functions as an advanced complement to Event Segmentation charts, enabling complex data analysis through flexible metric creation, attribution modeling, and session-based insights.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

Data Tables operates as a central analytical hub that integrates multiple measurement frameworks within Amplitude Analytics. The platform supports five core metric types that work in concert to provide comprehensive analytical capabilities:

**Event Segmentation metrics** form the foundation for basic event counting and user behavior analysis, while **Revenue metrics** enable financial performance tracking and monetization analysis. **Formula metrics** provide advanced computational capabilities using functions like TimeSpent(PV) and mathematical operations for custom calculations. **Funnel metrics** support conversion analysis across user journeys, and **Session metrics** deliver content path analysis through bounce rate, exit rate, entry rate, entries, and exits measurements.

The platform's **multi-touch attribution system** represents a sophisticated integration layer supporting eight pre-built attribution models: First Touch, Last Touch, Linear, Participation, U-Shaped, J-Shaped, Inverse J-Shaped, and Data Driven using Markov chains. Additionally, custom attribution models can be configured with specific lookback windows and weighting schemes for UTM source and marketing channel analysis.

**Session Analytics Integration** combines Entry/Exit Analysis with Time Spent Analysis to provide comprehensive session-based insights. Entry/Exit Analysis applies first/last session dimensions to metrics, while Time Spent Analysis calculates duration between consecutive events using 30-minute timeout windows for session boundary detection.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Group-by Properties** serve as the primary dimensional analysis mechanism, supporting nested breakdowns with specific constraints when time dimensions are involved. These properties multiply row limits and enable transpose functionality for flexible data visualization approaches.

**Active Events** refer to events processed within the computation flow for Entry/Exit Analysis, specifically those containing non-null property values used to extract first/last session dimensions from user journeys.

**Session Totals vs PROPCOUNT** represent distinct calculation methodologies where Session Totals aggregate data at the session level, while PROPCOUNT operates on individual event properties, providing different analytical perspectives on the same underlying data.

**Lookback Window** defines the configurable time period for attribution analysis, determining how far back in time to consider touchpoints in the customer journey for attribution calculations.

**Metric Verification/Officiation** represents an administrative process for validating and approving metrics for project-wide sharing, requiring Manager or Admin permissions to ensure data quality and consistency across teams.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Data Tables functions as a critical bridge between raw event data and actionable business insights within the broader Amplitude ecosystem. The platform integrates deeply with **Browser SDK** implementations, leveraging Page View events for time spent calculations and session analysis. It supports both primitive page view events and custom [Amplitude] Page View events, providing flexibility in implementation approaches.

**Dashboard REST API** integration provides programmatic access with specific row limits ranging from 20-10,000 for CSV exports, along with metric type restrictions for automated reporting and data extraction workflows. This enables seamless integration with external business intelligence tools and custom reporting systems.

The platform's **Marketing Analytics** capabilities integrate comprehensively with UTM tracking and marketing channel attribution systems, enabling sophisticated campaign performance analysis across multiple touchpoints and customer journey stages.

**Project-Wide Sharing** functionality enables metric standardization across teams through centralized metric creation and role-based permission management, ensuring consistent analytical approaches across organizational units.

## Technical Specifications and API Capabilities

The platform operates under specific technical constraints designed to balance analytical flexibility with performance optimization. **Result Limits** vary by context: display results range from 100-500 rows depending on metric type, while CSV exports support 20-10,000 rows based on metric complexity. Time properties used as group-bys multiply these base limits, and nested group-by configurations have additional specific row restrictions.

**Sorting Logic** operates on existing result sets without fetching additional data, maintaining query performance while providing flexible data organization capabilities for analytical workflows.

**Session Processing** utilizes a 30-minute timeout window for time spent calculations with automatic session boundary detection. The system includes sophisticated bounce session handling that excludes last page view events from certain calculations to ensure analytical accuracy.

**Attribution Processing** supports custom weighting schemes and enables multiple model comparison across event totals, property sum, and conversion attribution for acquisition touchpoints. This provides comprehensive attribution analysis capabilities for complex marketing measurement scenarios.

The platform emphasizes reusable metric creation, multi-dimensional analysis flexibility, and comprehensive session-based insights while maintaining optimal performance through intelligent result limiting and processing optimization strategies. Data Tables ultimately serves as a powerful analytical engine that transforms raw behavioral data into structured, actionable insights for data-driven decision making across growth, product, and marketing teams.
