# Amplitude Data Tables Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude Data Tables is an advanced analytics feature that enables multi-dimensional analysis of user behavior data. It allows users to compare multiple metrics across different dimensions in a single view, providing a comprehensive way to analyze and visualize data patterns. Data Tables is primarily available on Amplitude's Growth and Enterprise plans and serves as a powerful tool for marketing attribution, session analysis, and complex data exploration.

## Key Features and Capabilities

### Multi-Dimensional Analysis
- Compare multiple metrics across different dimensions in a single view
- Apply group-by properties to segment data in meaningful ways
- Support for nested group-by properties for hierarchical data analysis
- Transpose feature to switch rows and columns for flexible data visualization

### Metrics System
- Create reusable analysis objects (metrics) that can be shared project-wide
- Four metric types: Event Segmentation, Revenue, Formula, and Funnel
- Official designation capability for trusted metrics (managers and administrators only)
- Metrics deletion permissions based on user roles

### Attribution Modeling
- Multiple attribution models for crediting marketing touchpoints:
  - First Touch: 100% credit to first touchpoint
  - Last Touch: 100% credit to last touchpoint
  - Linear: Equal credit across all touchpoints
  - Participation: 100% credit to each touchpoint
  - U-Shaped: 40% to first, 40% to last, 20% distributed among middle touchpoints
  - J-Shaped: 20% to first, 60% to last, 20% distributed among middle touchpoints
  - Inverse J-Shaped: 60% to first, 20% to last, 20% distributed among middle touchpoints
  - Data-Driven: Uses Markov Chain modeling for algorithmic attribution
- Custom attribution models with specific weighting distributions
- Configurable lookback windows for attribution analysis

### Session Analysis
- Session metrics including bounce rate, exit rate, entry rate, entries, and exits
- Entry/Exit analysis to evaluate content paths based on first or last property values
- Time spent analysis between consecutive events with 30-minute timeout
- Support for different time units (seconds, minutes, hours)

## Data Handling and Limitations

### Row Limits and Sorting
- Display limits: 100-500 rows depending on group-by configuration
- Sorting applies only to displayed results without fetching new data
- Export limits: 10,000 rows for event segmentation (CSV), 300 for funnels (CSV)
- Dashboard REST API limit: 1,000 rows

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Metrics
- **Event Segmentation Metrics**: Based on event counts and properties
- **Revenue Metrics**: Focused on monetary values and transactions
- **Formula Metrics**: Custom calculations using other metrics
- **Funnel Metrics**: Measure conversion through defined steps

### Session Metrics
- **Bounce Rate**: Percentage of single-page sessions
- **Exit Rate**: Percentage of sessions ending on a specific page
- **Entry Rate**: Percentage of sessions starting on a specific page
- **Entries**: Count of sessions starting on a specific page
- **Exits**: Count of sessions ending on a specific page

### Attribution Terms
- **Multi-touch Attribution**: Method of crediting multiple marketing touchpoints
- **Lookback Window**: Time period considered for attribution analysis
- **Markov Chain Attribution**: Probabilistic model for data-driven attribution

### Analysis Types
- **Time Spent Analysis**: Measures duration between consecutive events
- **Entry/Exit Analysis**: Focuses on first or last property value in a session

## Integration in Amplitude Ecosystem

Data Tables integrates with the broader Amplitude Analytics platform, leveraging the event data collection infrastructure and user identification system. It serves as an advanced analysis tool that complements other Amplitude features:

- Uses the same event data as other Amplitude charts and visualizations
- Shares metrics with other analysis types for consistent measurement
- Exports data to CSV for further analysis in external tools
- Accessible through Dashboard REST API for programmatic access

## API and Integration Points

- **Dashboard REST API**: Access to Data Tables with a limit of 1,000 rows
- **CSV Export**: Export up to 10,000 rows for event segmentation, 300 for funnels
- **Metrics API**: Create and manage metrics programmatically
