# Amplitude Data Tables: Comprehensive Product Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude Data Tables is an advanced analytics feature that enables multi-dimensional analysis of user behavior data. It allows users to compare multiple metrics across different dimensions in a single view, providing deeper insights into user interactions and marketing effectiveness. Data Tables supports various analysis types including event segmentation, revenue tracking, funnel analysis, and attribution modeling.

## Key Features and Capabilities

### Multi-Dimensional Analysis
- Compare multiple metrics across different dimensions in a single view
- Apply group-by properties to segment data in meaningful ways
- Support for nested group-by properties for hierarchical data analysis
- Transpose feature to switch rows and columns for flexible visualization
- Filter capabilities to focus on specific segments or conditions

### Attribution Modeling
- Multiple attribution models for marketing touchpoint analysis:
  - First Touch: 100% credit to first touchpoint
  - Last Touch: 100% credit to last touchpoint
  - Linear: Equal credit across all touchpoints
  - Participation: 100% credit to each touchpoint
  - U-Shaped: 40% to first, 40% to last, 20% distributed among middle touchpoints
  - J-Shaped: 20% to first, 60% to last, 20% distributed among middle touchpoints
  - Inverse J-Shaped: 60% to first, 20% to last, 20% distributed among middle touchpoints
  - Data-Driven: Uses Markov Chain modeling for algorithmic attribution
- Custom attribution models with user-defined weighting distributions
- Configurable lookback windows for attribution analysis

### Metrics System
- Reusable analysis objects shareable across projects
- Four metric types:
  - Event Segmentation metrics
  - Revenue metrics
  - Formula metrics
  - Funnel metrics
- Official designation capability for verified metrics (managers/admins only)
- Available on Growth and Enterprise plans

### Session Analysis
- Session-specific metrics:
  - Bounce rate: Percentage of single-page sessions
  - Exit rate: Percentage of sessions ending on a specific page
  - Entry rate: Percentage of sessions starting on a specific page
  - Entries: Count of sessions starting on a specific page
  - Exits: Count of sessions ending on a specific page
- Entry/Exit analysis for first/last property values in sessions

### Time Spent Analysis
- Calculation of time between consecutive events with 30-minute timeout
- Support for primitive page views, filtered events, and custom events
- Specialized metrics for time spent per user, page, or session
- Available on Growth and Enterprise plans

## Data Handling and Limitations

- Row display limits: 100-500 rows for top-level group-bys
- Export limits vary by metric type:
  - 10,000 rows for event segmentation
  - 300 rows for funnels
  - 100 rows for sessions
  - 20 rows for attribution metrics
- Sorting applied only to displayed results
- Different behavior for nested group-bys and multiple metrics

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Group-by properties**: Dimensions used to segment data in analysis
- **Nested group-by**: Hierarchical organization of dimensions for deeper analysis
- **Attribution model**: Method for distributing credit across marketing touchpoints
- **Lookback window**: Time period considered for attribution analysis
- **Bounce rate**: Percentage of single-page sessions
- **Exit rate**: Percentage of sessions ending on a specific page
- **Entry rate**: Percentage of sessions starting on a specific page
- **Time spent analysis**: Measurement of duration between consecutive events
- **Official metrics**: Verified analysis objects designated by managers/admins

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Data Tables appears to be a core analysis feature within the broader Amplitude Analytics platform. It integrates with:

- Amplitude's metrics system for reusable analysis objects
- Event tracking infrastructure for data collection
- User session management for session-based analytics
- Marketing attribution systems for campaign analysis
- Dashboard and reporting tools for visualization

The feature is available on Growth and Enterprise plans, indicating it's positioned as an advanced analytics capability within Amplitude's tiered product offering.

## API and Technical Implementation

While specific API endpoints aren't explicitly mentioned, the documentation references:
