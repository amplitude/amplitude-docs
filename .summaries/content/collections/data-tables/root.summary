## Amplitude Data Tables Product Overview

Amplitude Data Tables is a sophisticated multi-dimensional analytics platform within Amplitude Analytics that enables users to create comprehensive tabular reports combining multiple metrics, group-by properties, and advanced analytical models. The product serves as a powerful analytical engine for user behavior analysis, marketing attribution, session analytics, and content performance measurement through flexible data visualization and manipulation capabilities.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

Data Tables operates as a central analytical hub integrating multiple Amplitude Analytics components:

**Core Integration Architecture:**
- **Event Segmentation Charts**: Bidirectional metric sharing with Event Segmentation, allowing metrics created in either interface to be utilized across both visualization types
- **Reusable Metrics System**: Supports project-wide metrics (Event Segmentation, Revenue, Formula, Funnels) that maintain consistency across Data Tables and other chart types
- **User Segments and Cohorts**: Generates cohorts from analysis results and applies existing user segments as analytical filters
- **Dashboard REST API**: Provides programmatic access to Data Tables results with configurable row limits for external integrations

**Specialized Analysis Modules:**
- **Multi-Touch Attribution Engine**: Incorporates 9 pre-built attribution models plus custom configurations for comprehensive marketing analysis
- **Session Metrics Calculator**: Dedicated session-based calculations including bounce rate, exit rate, and entry rate for content path analysis
- **Entry/Exit Analysis Framework**: Session dimension analysis applying first/last property values across various metric types
- **Time Spent Analysis Engine**: Duration calculations between consecutive events with configurable timeout windows

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Metric Classification System:**
- **Event Segmentation Metrics**: Standard event counting and unique user measurements
- **Revenue Metrics**: Financial performance and monetization measurements
- **Formula Metrics**: Custom calculated metrics using mathematical expressions and operators
- **Funnel Metrics**: Multi-step conversion analysis metrics
- **Session Totals**: Session-based aggregation metrics
- **PROPSUM**: Property value summation metrics for numerical property analysis

**Attribution Model Taxonomy:**
- **First Touch/Last Touch**: Single-point attribution crediting initial or final touchpoints
- **Linear Attribution**: Equal credit distribution across all customer journey touchpoints
- **Participation Attribution**: Full credit assignment to all contributing touchpoints
- **U-Shaped/J-Shaped/Inverse J-Shaped**: Weighted attribution models emphasizing different touchpoint positions in the customer journey
- **Data Driven Attribution**: Machine learning-based attribution utilizing Markov chain analysis
- **Lookback Window**: Configurable time period for considering attribution touchpoints

**Analysis Dimension Framework:**
- **Group-by Properties**: Categorical dimensions enabling data segmentation and breakdown
- **Nested Group-by**: Multi-level property hierarchies for complex dimensional analysis
- **Time Properties**: Temporal dimensions with specialized handling for row multiplication across time periods
- **Active Events**: Events that contribute to session-based calculations and metrics

**Session Analysis Terminology:**
- **Bounce Rate**: Percentage of single-page sessions within the analysis period
- **Entry/Exit Rate**: Percentage of sessions beginning/ending with specific property values
- **Session Entries/Exits**: Count of sessions initiating/terminating with specific events
- **30-Minute Timeout**: Standard session boundary definition for session continuity

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Data Tables integrates within Amplitude's comprehensive analytics ecosystem through multiple touchpoints:

**Plan-Based Feature Architecture:**
- Growth and Enterprise plans provide access to advanced capabilities including session metrics, time spent analysis, and enhanced attribution models
- Role-based permission system controls metric verification, deletion, and administrative functions

**Data Processing Infrastructure:**
- Integrates with Browser SDK for automated Page View event tracking
- Supports custom event definitions alongside primitive Amplitude events
- Processes data through specialized calculation engines optimized for different metric types

**Export and API Integration:**
- CSV export functionality with metric-specific row limits ranging from 100-10,000 rows
- Dashboard REST API integration enabling programmatic access to analysis results
- Configurable display options including relative percentages, data bars, and color-coded delta indicators

## Technical Implementation and Constraints

**Result Processing Limitations:**
- Display limits: 100-500 rows depending on metric complexity and type
- CSV export limits: 20-10,000 rows based on metric computational requirements
- Time properties as group-by dimensions can multiply row limits through period expansion

**Data Manipulation Capabilities:**
- Sorting functionality reorders existing results without additional data fetching
- Transpose functionality enables rows/columns interchange for alternative data views
- Period-over-period comparison capabilities with specialized sorting logic for temporal analysis

**Attribution Processing Configuration:**
- Custom lookback windows for attribution analysis with flexible time period settings
- UTM source and campaign attribution support for marketing channel analysis
- Channel-based attribution weighting across different metric types and touchpoint combinations

**Session Analysis Processing Engine:**
- Entry/Exit semantics apply first/last property values from active events within sessions
- Time spent calculations utilize consecutive event duration with configurable timeout handling
- Group-by property resets enable granular time analysis per dimensional breakdown

Data Tables represents Amplitude's solution for complex, multi-dimensional analytics that bridges simple event tracking and sophisticated business intelligence, providing marketers, product managers, and analysts with comprehensive tools for understanding user behavior patterns and optimizing business outcomes through data-driven insights.
