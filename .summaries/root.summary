# Amplitude Product Suite

## Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that helps businesses understand user behavior, optimize experiences, and make data-driven decisions. The platform provides robust tools for tracking user interactions across multiple platforms, analyzing behavioral patterns through advanced visualizations, conducting experiments with A/B testing, managing customer data with proper PII handling, recording user sessions for playback, and implementing type-safe tracking.

Organizations use Amplitude for product optimization, user experience improvement, feature testing, conversion optimization, and data-driven decision making across their digital products.

## Product Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem consists of five interconnected core products:

1. **Analytics** - The foundation of the platform that provides tools to track, visualize, and analyze user behavior through various charts and reports including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, and Journeys.

2. **Experiment** - An experimentation and feature flag management platform enabling A/B testing and controlled feature rollouts. It integrates directly with Analytics to measure experiment results and impact.

3. **CDP (Customer Data Platform)** - Manages the collection, organization, and activation of customer data, serving as the data infrastructure layer that handles data flows between systems with special consideration for PII.

4. **Ampli** - A SDK framework providing type safety and validation for implementing Amplitude tracking, ensuring consistent data collection across the organization.

5. **Session Replay** - Captures and allows playback of user sessions, providing visual context to complement the quantitative analytics data.

These products are supported by comprehensive SDKs for multiple platforms including Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal, Node.js, Python, Java, and Go, facilitating data collection from diverse sources.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Analytics Terminology
- **Event** - A discrete user action or system occurrence tracked in Amplitude
- **User Property** - Attributes associated with users that provide context for analysis
- **Session** - A period of continuous user activity, defined by configurable timeout parameters
- **Funnel** - A sequence of events representing a conversion path or user journey
- **Retention** - Measurement of users returning to the product over specified time periods
- **Cohort** - A group of users who share common characteristics or behaviors
- **LTV (Lifetime Value)** - The predicted or actual value of a user throughout their relationship with the product

### Experimentation Terminology
- **Experiment** - A controlled test comparing different variants of a feature
- **Feature Flag** - A toggle that enables/disables features or serves different variants to users
- **Variant** - A specific version of a feature being tested in an experiment
- **Deployment** - An environment (development, staging, production) where experiments or flags are active
- **Mutex Group** - A mechanism ensuring users are only included in one experiment from a defined set
- **Holdout Group** - A control group excluded from specific experiments to measure overall platform impact
- **Bucketing** - The deterministic process of assigning users to experiment variants

### Data Management Terminology
- **Source** - An origin point for data imported into Amplitude (third-party tools, data warehouses)
- **Destination** - A target system where Amplitude data is exported for activation
- **Audience** - A defined segment of users for targeting or analysis
- **PII** - Personally Identifiable Information requiring special handling for privacy compliance
- **Warehouse-Native** - Direct integration with data warehouses without requiring API keys

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude follows a data flow architecture:

1. **Data Collection** - User behavior data is collected via SDKs or imported from external sources
2. **Data Processing** - The CDP processes, transforms, and routes data appropriately
3. **Analysis** - Analytics tools visualize data and derive insights
4. **Experimentation** - Experiment enables testing hypotheses based on insights
5. **Activation** - Insights and audiences are exported to destination systems for action

The platform supports both client-side implementation (via browser and mobile SDKs) and server-side implementation (via server SDKs). Regional deployments are available for compliance with data residency requirements.

Amplitude integrates with the broader marketing and product technology ecosystem through pre-built integrations with popular tools, API-based custom integrations, data warehouse connections, and webhook support for real-time data activation.

## API Endpoints and Implementation

### Analytics API
- Base URL: `/apis/analytics/{endpoint}`
- Provides programmatic access to query and export analytics data

### Experiment API
- Evaluation API: `GET /api/2/variantAssignments` - Determines which variant a user should see
- Management API endpoints:
  - `/experiments` - CRUD operations for experiments
  - `/flags` - CRUD operations for feature flags
  - `/deployments` - Manage environment configurations
  - `/mutexes` - Configure experiment mutual exclusion groups
  - `/holdouts` - Manage holdout groups
  - `/versions` - Track configuration changes

### SDK Implementation Pattern
All Amplitude SDKs follow a consistent implementation pattern:
1. Installation via the appropriate package manager
2. Initialization with API key and configuration options
3. User identification and property setting
4. Event tracking through method calls
5. Optional advanced configuration for specific use cases

The Ampli SDK framework extends this pattern by generating type-safe tracking libraries based on a predefined tracking plan, ensuring consistency across implementations.
