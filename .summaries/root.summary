Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products: Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Core Product Architecture

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational product, providing behavioral analytics through specialized chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Stickiness, Lifecycle, Personas, Compass, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Revenue LTV, Data Tables, and Experiment Results. Each chart type offers targeted analysis capabilities for different aspects of user behavior and product performance.

**Amplitude Experiment** is the feature flagging and A/B testing platform enabling controlled rollouts and experimentation. It encompasses advanced techniques, experiment theory, workflow management, troubleshooting capabilities, and technical implementation details. The platform supports both feature flags for controlled rollouts and statistical experimentation with comprehensive result analysis.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user sessions to provide visual insights into user interactions and identify friction points in the user experience.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** delivers in-product user engagement through contextual guides, feedback collection surveys, and resource centers for user onboarding and retention.

The **Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation through sources, destinations, audiences, and warehouse-native capabilities.

## SDK and API Ecosystem

The platform provides extensive SDK support across multiple programming languages and platforms:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal implementations, each following platform-specific conventions while maintaining consistent core functionality.

**Experiment SDKs** provide feature flag evaluation and experiment assignment capabilities across the same platform ecosystem.

**Ampli** serves as a type-safe wrapper that generates strongly-typed tracking libraries based on your tracking plan, ensuring data quality and consistency across implementations.

**API endpoints** include:
- Analytics API (`/apis/analytics/`) for data ingestion and querying
- Experiment APIs (`/apis/experiment/`) for flag management and assignment
- Guides and Surveys API (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) for content management

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** are user actions tracked within applications, forming the foundation of all analytics. **Properties** are attributes associated with events or users that enable segmentation and analysis. **Cohorts** are user segments defined by shared characteristics or behaviors.

**Experiments** encompass both feature flags (binary on/off switches) and A/B tests (statistical comparisons between variants). **Flags** control feature visibility and rollout, while **Variants** represent different versions of features being tested.

**Charts** are analytical visualizations that transform raw event data into actionable insights. Each chart type serves specific analytical purposes, from basic event counting to complex behavioral flow analysis.

**Sources** are data ingestion points that send events to Amplitude, while **Destinations** are external systems that receive processed data from Amplitude. **Transformations** modify data as it flows through the platform.

**Agents** are automated systems or integrations that perform specific functions within the platform ecosystem.

## Advanced Analytics Capabilities

The platform supports sophisticated analytical approaches through specialized chart types:

**Behavioral Analysis**: Event Segmentation tracks user actions over time, Funnel Analysis measures conversion through sequential steps, and User Sessions analyze engagement patterns within individual sessions.

**Retention and Lifecycle**: Retention Analysis measures user return behavior, Lifecycle charts track user progression through different engagement stages, and Stickiness measures feature adoption frequency.

**Advanced Segmentation**: Personas creates behavioral user segments, Compass provides metric correlation analysis, and Impact Analysis measures the effect of specific events on key metrics.

**Revenue Analytics**: Revenue LTV calculates customer lifetime value, while various charts can be configured to track monetary metrics and business outcomes.

## Experimentation Framework

Amplitude Experiment provides a comprehensive framework for controlled testing:

**Experiment Theory** covers statistical foundations, sample size calculations, and result interpretation methodologies.

**Advanced Techniques** include multi-armed bandits, sequential testing, and complex experimental designs.

**Workflow Management** encompasses experiment planning, execution, monitoring, and result analysis processes.

**Integration Capabilities** allow experiments to connect with external systems and data sources through dedicated integrations.

## Data Management and Integration

The CDP component manages data flow through:

**Source Catalog** provides pre-built integrations for common data sources, while custom sources enable flexible data ingestion patterns.

**Destination Catalog** offers integrations with marketing, analytics, and business intelligence tools for data activation.

**Warehouse-native Amplitude** enables analysis of data stored in customer data warehouses without requiring data movement.

**PII Integrations** handle personally identifiable information with appropriate privacy and security controls.

**Audiences** create actionable user segments that can be synchronized to external marketing and engagement platforms.

## Administrative and Organizational Features

**Account Management** provides user provisioning, role management, and organizational structure controls.

**Single Sign-on** enables enterprise authentication integration for secure access management.

**Billing and Use** tracks platform usage and manages subscription limits and overages.

The platform implements hierarchical permission structures that control access to different products, features, and data based on organizational roles and responsibilities.

## Developer and Implementation Support

**Instrumentation** guidance helps organizations implement proper event tracking and data collection strategies.

**Migration** resources assist in transitioning from other analytics platforms to Amplitude.

**Troubleshooting** documentation addresses common implementation and operational issues across all products.

**Partners** ecosystem provides certified integrations and professional services for implementation and optimization.

The platform supports both English and Japanese localization, indicating global enterprise deployment capabilities.

## Broader Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates with the broader marketing technology and product development ecosystem through its extensive API surface, SDK libraries, and partner integrations. The platform serves as both a data destination (receiving events from various sources) and a data source (sending insights and segments to activation platforms).

The modular architecture allows organizations to adopt individual components (Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, etc.) independently or as an integrated suite, providing flexibility in implementation and scaling based on organizational needs and maturity.
