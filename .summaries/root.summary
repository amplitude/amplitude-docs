# Amplitude Product Ecosystem

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics platform that helps businesses understand user behavior, optimize experiences, and drive growth. The platform enables companies to track user interactions, analyze behavioral patterns, run experiments, and make data-driven decisions.

Key features include:
- User behavior tracking and analysis
- Data visualization through various chart types
- A/B testing and feature experimentation
- Data integration with external sources and destinations
- Privacy and PII management
- Cross-platform SDK support

Primary use cases include product analytics, user journey optimization, feature experimentation, conversion optimization, and user retention analysis.

## Product Relationships and Features

The Amplitude ecosystem consists of several interconnected products:

### Analytics
The core analytics platform serves as the central hub for visualizing and analyzing user behavior data. It offers:
- Multiple chart types (event segmentation, funnels, retention)
- User journey mapping
- Cohort analysis
- Revenue and lifetime value tracking
- Impact analysis
- Persona identification

### Data
The data management component handles:
- Data collection and integration
- Source and destination catalogs for external system connections
- PII management and governance
- Tracking plan implementation
- Data quality monitoring

### Experiment
The experimentation platform enables:
- A/B testing
- Feature flag management
- Experiment results analysis
- Targeted rollouts
- Integration with the analytics platform for results measurement

### SDKs
Amplitude provides client and server libraries for instrumenting applications across platforms:
- Mobile: Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal
- Web: Browser, JavaScript frameworks
- Server: Java, Python, Node.js, Go
- Specialized: Ampli (type-safe analytics based on tracking plans)
- Experiment-specific SDKs for implementing feature flags

### Integration Capabilities
- Source Catalog: Imports data from external platforms
- Destination Catalog: Exports data to external systems
- Warehouse-Native Amplitude: Direct integration with data warehouses
- API-based integrations for custom workflows

### Admin
Handles organizational settings including:
- Account management
- Billing
- User permissions
- Single sign-on configuration

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: A discrete user action or system occurrence tracked in Amplitude
- **User ID**: Custom identifier for a specific user, set by the application
- **Device ID**: Unique identifier for a device, persisted across app installations
- **Session**: Period of continuous user engagement with an application
- **Identify**: Operations that update user properties without sending events
- **Group**: Collection of users that can be analyzed together (e.g., company, organization)
- **Tracking Plan**: Schema defining expected events and their properties
- **Ampli Wrapper**: Code-generated SDK wrapper providing type-safe analytics
- **Chart**: Visualization of analytics data in various formats
- **Funnel**: Analysis of user progression through a sequence of events
- **Retention**: Analysis of user return behavior over time
- **Cohort**: Group of users who share common characteristics or behaviors
- **Experiment**: A/B test or feature flag implementation
- **Integration Category**: Classification for source and destination integrations
- **User Property**: Attribute associated with a user (e.g., demographics, preferences)
- **Event Property**: Metadata associated with a specific event occurrence

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's products work together in an integrated workflow:

1. **Data Collection**: Applications instrumented with Amplitude SDKs send event data to the platform
2. **Data Processing**: The Analytics platform processes, stores, and prepares this data for analysis
3. **Data Analysis**: Users leverage charts and visualization tools to derive insights
4. **Data Action**: Insights drive experiments and feature flags through the Experiment product
5. **Data Distribution**: Analyzed data and insights can be exported to external systems

Cross-product workflows include:
- Creating user cohorts in Analytics and targeting them in Experiment
- Using tracking plans from Data to generate type-safe Ampli wrappers
- Analyzing experiment results in Analytics charts
- Exporting insights through the destination catalog
- Implementing privacy controls in Data that affect all products

The platform supports a closed-loop analytics process where insights lead to experiments, which generate new data for further analysis.
