# Amplitude Analytics Platform

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics platform that provides product analytics, experimentation, customer data management, and user engagement tools. The platform enables organizations to track user behavior, run experiments, manage customer data pipelines, and derive actionable insights from user interactions across web, mobile, and server-side applications.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem consists of several interconnected products that work together to provide end-to-end analytics capabilities:

**Core Analytics Platform**: The foundation includes event tracking, user segmentation, and behavioral analytics through various chart types (Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, Cohort Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Revenue LTV, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, and Experiment Results). These analytics tools are supported by a comprehensive SDK ecosystem and REST APIs.

**Amplitude Experiment**: A feature flagging and A/B testing platform that integrates with the core analytics for experiment analysis. It includes advanced techniques, experiment theory, workflow management, troubleshooting tools, and "under the hood" technical documentation. The platform supports both client-side and server-side experimentation with dedicated SDKs.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)**: Manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation through source and destination catalogs. The CDP includes audience management, data governance, warehouse-native capabilities, and PII handling integrations. It connects to hundreds of third-party tools and data warehouses.

**Amplitude Session Replay**: Captures and reconstructs user sessions for visual behavior analysis, providing heatmaps and session recordings with privacy controls and compliance features.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys**: Enables in-product messaging, user onboarding, and feedback collection through targeted campaigns and survey tools.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events and Properties**: Events represent user actions (clicks, page views, purchases) while properties are attributes that describe events (user ID, timestamp, device type). Event segmentation allows filtering and grouping of events by properties.

**Users and Sessions**: Users are unique individuals tracked across sessions. Sessions represent continuous periods of user activity. User properties describe user attributes while session properties describe session characteristics.

**Cohorts and Audiences**: Cohorts are groups of users who performed specific actions within defined time periods. Audiences are dynamic user segments that update in real-time based on behavioral criteria and can be synced to external platforms.

**Funnels and Journeys**: Funnels track user progression through sequential steps (signup → activation → purchase). Journeys map all possible user paths between events, showing the complete user flow landscape.

**Retention and Stickiness**: Retention measures how many users return over time periods. Stickiness measures how frequently users engage within specific time windows (daily active users who use the product X days per week).

**Experiments and Feature Flags**: Experiments are controlled tests comparing different user experiences. Feature flags control feature rollouts and can be used for gradual releases, kill switches, and operational controls.

**Sources and Destinations**: Sources are data inputs (SDKs, APIs, third-party integrations) that send events to Amplitude. Destinations are external platforms where Amplitude sends processed data (marketing tools, data warehouses, CRMs).

## Integration Within the Broader Product Ecosystem

The platform operates through multiple integration layers:

**SDK Ecosystem**: Comprehensive SDKs for all major platforms including Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, and specialized SDKs for experiments. The Ampli wrapper provides type-safe analytics implementation with code generation.

**API Infrastructure**: REST APIs for Analytics, Experiment management, Guides and Surveys, and various administrative functions. APIs support both data ingestion and data export with rate limiting and authentication controls.

**Third-Party Integrations**: Extensive partner ecosystem including marketing automation platforms, customer support tools, data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift), and business intelligence tools. The destination catalog includes 200+ integrations.

**Enterprise Features**: Single sign-on (SSO) integration, role-based access controls, data governance tools, and compliance features for GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Core API Endpoints**:
- `/analytics/*` - Event ingestion, user properties, and behavioral data queries
- `/apis/experiment/*` - Feature flag management, experiment configuration, and results analysis  
- `/apis/guides-and-surveys/*` - Campaign management and survey response collection
- `/admin/*` - Account management, billing, user administration, and SSO configuration

**SDK Implementation Patterns**:
- Event tracking: `amplitude.track('Event Name', {property: 'value'})`
- User identification: `amplitude.setUserId('user_id')`
- User properties: `amplitude.identify(new amplitude.Identify().set('property', 'value'))`
- Group analytics: `amplitude.setGroup('company', 'amplitude')`

**Experiment SDK Methods**:
- Feature flag evaluation: `experiment.variant('flag-key')`
- User context: `experiment.setUser({user_id: 'user', device_id: 'device'})`
- Remote evaluation: `experiment.fetch(user)`

**Data Export and Warehouse Integration**:
- Raw event export to cloud storage (S3, GCS, Azure)
- Warehouse-native querying through Snowflake, BigQuery connectors
- Real-time streaming through Kafka and other message queues

The platform supports both cloud and on-premises deployments with EU data residency options, comprehensive monitoring and alerting, and enterprise-grade security controls including data encryption, audit logging, and compliance certifications.
