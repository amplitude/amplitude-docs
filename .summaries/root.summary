# Amplitude Product Ecosystem

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics platform that helps organizations understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive business growth. The platform enables data-driven decision making through robust analytics, experimentation capabilities, and data management tools.

Key features include:
- Behavioral analytics for tracking user interactions and product performance
- Experimentation and A/B testing tools with feature flagging
- Data collection, processing, and management across platforms
- User segmentation and cohort analysis
- Session replay for visual analysis of user interactions
- Integration with third-party tools and data warehouses
- Cross-platform SDKs for instrumentation and data collection

## Product Relationships and Structure

The Amplitude ecosystem consists of several interconnected products:

1. **Analytics** - The core platform for behavioral analysis:

   - Event Segmentation for detailed user behavior analysis
   - Journeys for visualizing user paths
   - Personas for user segmentation
   - Compass for feature impact analysis
   - Impact Analysis for measuring changes
   - Engagement Matrix for understanding user interactions

2. **Experiment** - Platform for A/B testing and feature experimentation:
   - Experiment design and methodology
   - Advanced experimentation techniques
   - Workflow management
   - Technical implementation details
   - Dedicated APIs and SDKs
   - Troubleshooting resources

3. **Data** - Tools for data management and integration:
   - Sources for data collection
   - Audiences for user segmentation
   - Destination Catalog for exporting data
   - Source Catalog for importing data
   - PII management for privacy compliance
   - Customer Data Platform (CDP) capabilities

4. **SDKs** - Development kits for application instrumentation:
   - Platform-specific SDKs (Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal)
   - Language-specific SDKs (JavaScript, Java, Python, Go, Node.js)
   - Ampli for type-safe instrumentation

5. **Session Replay** - Visual analytics tool for recreating and analyzing user sessions

6. **Admin** - Platform administration and settings:
   - Account Management
   - Billing and Usage monitoring
   - Single Sign-On configuration

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Events**: Discrete user actions or system occurrences tracked in Amplitude
- **Properties**: Contextual metadata attached to events
- **User Properties**: Attributes that describe users
- **Cohorts**: Groups of users with shared characteristics or behaviors
- **Funnels**: Sequential event analysis showing conversion through defined steps
- **Retention**: Analysis of continued user engagement over time
- **Journeys**: Visualization of user navigation paths through a product
- **Experiment**: Controlled test comparing variations of a feature
- **Feature Flag**: Toggle mechanism to enable/disable features for specific users
- **Source**: Origin point for data flowing into Amplitude
- **Destination**: System receiving data exported from Amplitude
- **SDK**: Libraries enabling data collection from applications
- **Ampli**: Code generation tool creating type-safe wrappers for Amplitude SDKs
- **Session Replay**: Feature recording and reproducing user interactions

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's products work together in an integrated workflow:

1. **Data Flow**:
   - SDKs collect user interaction data from applications
   - Data is transmitted to Amplitude via APIs
   - Analytics processes and visualizes the data
   - Processed data can be exported to destinations or used in experiments

2. **Analytics and Experimentation**:
   - Analytics insights inform experiment hypotheses
   - Experiment results are analyzed using Analytics tools
   - Impact Analysis quantifies experiment outcomes

3. **Data Management**:
   - Sources feed data into Analytics
   - Audiences created in Analytics can be exported to Destinations
   - CDP connects customer data across touchpoints

4. **Cross-Platform Capabilities**:
   - Consistent data collection across web and mobile
   - Unified user identity across devices
   - Integrated analysis across all customer touchpoints

## API Endpoints and Implementation

### Analytics API
- Base URL: `/apis/analytics/`
- Endpoints for querying analytics data and managing resources

### Experiment APIs
- Base URL: `/apis/experiment/`
- Endpoints for managing experiments, feature flags, and targeting rules

### SDK Implementation Examples

**Browser SDK**:
```javascript
import * as amplitude from '@amplitude/analytics-browser';
amplitude.init('API_KEY');
amplitude.track('Button Clicked', { buttonColor: 'blue' });
```

**iOS SDK**:
```swift
import AmplitudeSwift
let amplitude = Amplitude(configuration: Configuration(apiKey: "API_KEY"))
amplitude.track(eventType: "Button Clicked", eventProperties: ["buttonColor": "blue"])
```

**Android SDK**:
```kotlin
import com.amplitude.android.Amplitude
val amplitude = Amplitude(Configuration(apiKey = "API_KEY"))
amplitude.track("Button Clicked", mapOf("buttonColor" to "blue"))
```

**Ampli SDK** (code-generated wrapper):
```javascript
import { ampli } from './ampli';
ampli.load({ client: { apiKey: 'API_KEY' } });
ampli.buttonClicked({ buttonColor: 'blue' });
```

**Session Replay Integration**:
```javascript
import * as amplitude from '@amplitude/analytics-browser';
import { sessionReplayPlugin } from '@amplitude/session-replay-browser';
amplitude.init('API_KEY');
amplitude.add(sessionReplayPlugin());
```
