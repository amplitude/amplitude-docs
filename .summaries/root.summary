### Customer Data Platform
CDP capabilities enable personalization and data activation through:

- **Audience Management**: Behavioral cohorts and predictive segments
- **Data Activation**: Cohort syncing to marketing platforms
- **Personalization**: AI-powered recommendations and predictions

## Product Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem features clear relationships between products:

1. **Data Collection → Analysis → Action**: Data flows from collection through SDKs to analysis in charts and finally to action through experimentation or engagement tools.

2. **Shared User Identity**: All products use the same user identification system for consistent tracking.

3. **Integrated Experimentation**: Experiment results are analyzed using the same analytics tools that track regular product metrics.

4. **Activation Capabilities**: Analytics insights can be activated through cohort syncing to marketing platforms.

5. **Cross-Platform Consistency**: SDKs maintain consistent tracking capabilities while respecting platform-specific implementation patterns.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Events**: User actions tracked in the system (clicks, page views, purchases)
- **Event Properties**: Contextual data about specific events
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes associated with users
- **Cohorts**: Groups of users sharing common behaviors or attributes
- **Sessions**: Periods of continuous user activity
- **Amplitude ID**: Internal identifier linking device IDs and user IDs
- **Tracking Plan**: Schema defining expected events and properties
- **Feature Flag**: Toggle controlling feature availability
- **Experiment**: Controlled test comparing different variants
- **Monthly Tracked Users (MTU)**: Primary billing metric counting unique users per month

## Technical Implementation

Amplitude offers multiple implementation options:

1. **Client-Side SDKs**: Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity
2. **Server-Side SDKs**: Node.js, Python, Go, Java, Ruby
3. **Ampli Wrapper**: Type-safe implementation based on tracking plans
4. **HTTP APIs**: Direct event sending through REST endpoints

The platform supports both EU and US data residency options with appropriate server endpoints for each region. Authentication uses API keys for client-side implementations and Secret keys for server-side security.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude functions as an integrated ecosystem enabling organizations to:
- Collect high-quality data through various SDKs
- Derive meaningful insights through specialized analytics tools
- Test hypotheses through experimentation features
- Create personalized user experiences through engagement tools
- Activate insights through the CDP capabilities

This unified platform supports cross-functional collaboration between product, marketing, and engineering teams, providing a complete solution for data-driven product optimization and growth.
