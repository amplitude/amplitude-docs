Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and make data-driven decisions through advanced analytics, feature experimentation, and customer data management capabilities.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem consists of four core product areas that work together to provide end-to-end product intelligence:

**Analytics Platform** serves as the foundation, offering multiple chart types for behavioral analysis including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Revenue LTV, and Experiment Results. These charts enable teams to analyze user behavior patterns, conversion flows, and product performance metrics.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities through both remote and local evaluation modes. The experimentation platform includes advanced techniques, experiment theory, workflow management, and troubleshooting tools, supported by dedicated Experiment APIs and SDKs for seamless integration.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation through Sources, Destinations, Audiences, and warehouse-native capabilities. The CDP includes extensive integration catalogs for both data sources and destinations, enabling comprehensive data orchestration across the marketing and analytics stack.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user sessions to provide qualitative insights that complement quantitative analytics, helping teams understand the "why" behind user behaviors.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product messaging and feedback collection to drive user engagement and gather customer insights directly within applications.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events and Properties**: The fundamental data model where events represent user actions and properties provide contextual information. Events are tracked through various SDKs and analyzed across different chart types.

**Cohorts and Audiences**: User segments created based on behavioral criteria. Cohorts are used for analysis within Amplitude, while Audiences can be synced to external platforms for activation.

**Experiments and Variants**: Feature experiments contain multiple variants with configurable payloads, rollout weights, and targeting segments. Experiments use bucketing configurations with `bucketingKey`, `bucketingSalt`, and `rolloutPercentage` for user assignment.

**Deployments and Flags**: Deployment targets that experiments and feature flags can be assigned to, supporting both client and server deployment types with regional availability.

**Mutex Groups and Holdouts**: Traffic management systems where mutex groups prevent experiment overlap through slot-based assignment, while holdout groups maintain control populations for statistical validity.

**Charts and Dashboards**: Visualization tools that transform event data into actionable insights, with each chart type optimized for specific analytical use cases.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates with hundreds of data sources and destinations through its comprehensive integration catalogs. The platform supports both real-time streaming and batch data processing, enabling organizations to centralize their customer data while maintaining flexibility in their technology stack.

The experimentation platform automatically generates `[Experiment] Assignment` events that integrate with Amplitude's analytics capabilities, creating a closed-loop system for measuring experiment impact. This integration enables teams to analyze experiment results using the full suite of Amplitude's analytical tools.

Multi-site support includes English and Japanese localization, with regional deployment options including EU data residency for compliance requirements. The platform maintains feature parity across geographic regions while supporting local regulatory needs.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Analytics APIs** provide programmatic access to chart data, user properties, and behavioral metrics through the `/apis/analytics/` endpoint structure.

**Experiment APIs** offer both evaluation and management capabilities:
- Evaluation API: `/v1/vardata` for variant assignments, `/v1/flags` for local evaluation
- Management API: `/api/1/experiments`, `/api/1/flags`, `/api/1/deployments` for administrative control

**Guides and Surveys API** enables programmatic management of in-product messaging campaigns through `/apis/guides-and-surveys/` endpoints.

**SDK Ecosystem** includes comprehensive instrumentation libraries for:
- **Analytics SDKs**: Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, Unreal
- **Experiment SDKs**: Platform-specific libraries for feature flag evaluation
- **Ampli**: Type-safe analytics wrapper providing compile-time validation

Authentication varies by API type, with deployment keys for evaluation APIs and management API keys for administrative operations. Rate limiting is enforced at 100 requests per second with 100,000 daily limits for management APIs.

The platform supports both remote and local evaluation modes for experiments, cursor-based pagination across list endpoints, and comprehensive versioning systems that maintain audit trails of all configuration changes. This architecture enables enterprise-scale implementations while maintaining performance and reliability for real-time use cases.
