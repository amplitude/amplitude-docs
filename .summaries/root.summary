# Amplitude Product Analytics and Experimentation Platform

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple integrated products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP), all supported by extensive SDK libraries and API integrations.

## Core Product Architecture and Relationships

### Analytics Foundation
**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the platform's core, providing event-based user behavior tracking and analysis through sophisticated charting capabilities. The system centers around Event Segmentation as its primary analytical engine, supporting specialized chart types including Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Stickiness, Lifecycle, Personas, Compass, Impact Analysis, Revenue LTV, and Engagement Matrix. Each chart type addresses specific analytical use cases, from conversion optimization to user engagement measurement.

### Experimentation Platform
**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities through advanced statistical methodologies. The platform supports sequential testing, multi-armed bandits, and sophisticated experiment design patterns. Key components include experiment theory documentation, advanced techniques for complex testing scenarios, workflow management for experiment lifecycle, and comprehensive troubleshooting resources. The system integrates with analytics through Experiment Results charts and supports both client-side and server-side experimentation.

### Qualitative Analytics
**Session Replay** captures and analyzes user session recordings, providing qualitative insights to complement quantitative analytics. **Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user research and feedback collection, supporting user onboarding flows and experience optimization.

### Data Infrastructure
The **Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data collection, transformation, and distribution through source and destination catalogs. The platform supports warehouse-native architectures, audience management, and extensive third-party integrations. Data Tables provide structured data analysis capabilities, while the broader data ecosystem includes PII management and compliance features.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions
