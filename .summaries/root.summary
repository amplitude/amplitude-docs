Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products: Analytics (behavioral analysis and visualization), Experiment (A/B testing and feature flagging), Session Replay (user session recording), Guides and Surveys (in-product messaging), and a Customer Data Platform (CDP) for data management and activation.

## Product Architecture and Core Components

### Analytics Platform
The Analytics core provides event tracking, user segmentation, and behavioral analysis through specialized chart types including Event Segmentation for basic analytics, Funnel Analysis for conversion tracking, Retention Analysis for user engagement, Cohort analysis via Lifecycle charts, User journey mapping through Journeys, Engagement Matrix for feature adoption, Impact Analysis for measuring changes, Stickiness for usage frequency, Revenue LTV for monetization tracking, User Sessions for session-based analysis, Personas for user clustering, and Data Tables for raw data exploration.

**Compass** serves as an AI-powered insights engine that automatically surfaces significant trends, anomalies, and opportunities within user data.

### Experimentation Platform (Amplitude Experiment)
A comprehensive A/B testing and feature flagging solution featuring feature flag management, multivariate testing, advanced targeting and segmentation, statistical analysis with sequential testing, and experiment result visualization. Advanced capabilities include mutual exclusion groups, holdout testing, sophisticated statistical techniques, and deep integration with analytics for comprehensive impact measurement.

### Session Replay
Provides user session recording and playback capabilities to understand user interactions and identify friction points in the product experience.

### Guides and Surveys
An in-product messaging and feedback collection system enabling contextual user engagement and data collection.

### Customer Data Platform (CDP)
A comprehensive data management solution featuring integration with 100+ data sources through the Source Catalog, 200+ destination integrations through the Destination Catalog, dynamic Audiences with real-time segmentation, and robust data governance including PII management and compliance tools.

## Product Relationships and Integration

The platform operates on a unified data model enabling sophisticated cross-product workflows. Analytics insights can directly create experiments using behavioral segments as targeting criteria. Experiment results automatically flow into analytics charts for comprehensive impact analysis. CDP audience segments serve both analytics filtering and experiment targeting. Session recordings can be filtered by experiment variants or analytics segments to understand qualitative user behavior.

The event stream architecture ensures all user interactions flow through a central pipeline accessible to all products, with unified user identity resolution and real-time processing for immediate availability across analytics, experiment assignment, and audience updates.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Core Analytics Concepts
- **Events**: User actions tracked within applications (clicks, page views, purchases)
- **Properties**: Attributes associated with events (event properties) or users (user properties)
- **Cohorts**: Groups of users defined by shared characteristics or behaviors
- **Segments**: Dynamic filters applied to data analysis
- **Funnels**: Sequential steps in user journeys with conversion tracking
- **Retention**: Measurement of user return behavior over time periods

### Experimentation Terminology
- **Feature Flags**: Boolean toggles controlling feature availability
- **Variants**: Different versions of features being tested
- **Allocation**: Percentage of users exposed to experiments
- **Mutual Exclusion**: Preventing users from participating in conflicting experiments
- **Sequential Testing**: Statistical method allowing continuous monitoring without multiple testing penalties
- **Holdout Groups**: Control populations excluded from all experiments

### Data Management
- **Tracking Plan**: Schema definition for events and properties via Amplitude Data
- **Ampli**: Code generation tool creating type-safe analytics implementations
- **Warehouse-native**: Architecture allowing analysis of data stored in customer data warehouses
- **Real-time Streaming**: Immediate data processing and availability
- **Server Zones**: Geographic data processing regions (US, EU)

## Broader Product Ecosystem

Amplitude operates within a comprehensive analytics and optimization ecosystem supporting both cloud-hosted and warehouse-native deployments. The platform integrates with enterprise authentication systems through SAML and OIDC, provides multi-organization support with role-based access control, and includes extensive data governance capabilities for compliance and data sovereignty.

The developer ecosystem encompasses comprehensive SDKs for Analytics across Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal platforms, with specialized Experiment SDKs for feature flag evaluation. The Ampli integration provides type-safe code generation across all SDK platforms.
