The platform exposes comprehensive APIs for programmatic access and integration. The **Analytics API** provides endpoints for event ingestion, user property management, and data export. **Experiment APIs** enable flag configuration, user assignment, and results analysis. The **Guides and Surveys API** supports programmatic survey management and response collection.

API endpoints follow RESTful conventions with authentication via API keys and bearer tokens. Rate limiting varies by endpoint and plan tier, with enterprise customers receiving higher limits. Common endpoints include:
- `/events` for event ingestion
- `/users` for user property management  
- `/cohorts` for audience export
- `/flags` for feature flag management
- `/experiments` for A/B test configuration

## Data Management and Activation Framework

The **Source Catalog** encompasses over 50 integrations for data ingestion from various platforms including marketing tools, customer support systems, payment processors, and other analytics platforms. Sources support both batch and real-time data synchronization with configurable field mapping and transformation capabilities.

The **Destination Catalog** features 100+ integrations for data activation across marketing automation platforms, advertising networks, customer engagement tools, and data warehouses. Destinations support multiple activation patterns including cohort syncing for audience targeting, event streaming for real-time triggers, and bulk exports for data warehouse integration.

**Audiences** functionality enables sophisticated user segmentation based on behavioral patterns, with support for complex criteria including event sequences, property filters, and time-based conditions. Audiences can be synced to destinations for activation or used within Amplitude for analysis and experimentation.

## Chart Types and Analysis Capabilities
