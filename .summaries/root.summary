Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of four core products that work together to provide end-to-end analytics capabilities: Analytics (behavioral analysis), Experiment (A/B testing and feature flags), Data (governance and schema management), and Session Replay (qualitative user insights).

## High-Level Product Overview

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational product analytics platform, providing sophisticated event-based tracking and analysis through specialized chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Revenue LTV, and advanced features like Compass and Impact Analysis. The platform supports both real-time and historical analysis with comprehensive user segmentation, cohort management, and behavioral analytics capabilities.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers feature flagging and A/B testing functionality with both remote and local evaluation modes, supporting traditional A/B tests, multi-armed bandit experiments, and progressive feature rollouts. The platform includes sophisticated statistical analysis using sequential testing methodology, mutual exclusion groups, and comprehensive targeting capabilities.

**Amplitude Data** provides data governance, schema management, and tracking plan enforcement through a Git-like branching model. It includes the Ampli CLI for generating type-safe SDK wrappers, real-time data validation, and comprehensive transformation capabilities for maintaining data quality across the analytics ecosystem.

**Session Replay** captures and reconstructs user interactions across web and mobile platforms, providing qualitative context to quantitative analytics through session recordings, heatmaps, and privacy-compliant user behavior analysis.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

The Amplitude ecosystem operates through deep integration between its core products. Analytics provides the data foundation that feeds into Experiment for statistical analysis and audience targeting. Data governs the schema and quality of information flowing through both Analytics and Experiment, while Session Replay adds qualitative context to quantitative findings from Analytics.

**Cross-Product Data Flow**: Events tracked through Analytics SDKs automatically generate exposure and assignment events for Experiment analysis. Session Replay recordings can be accessed directly from Analytics charts and Experiment results, creating seamless workflows between quantitative and qualitative analysis.

**Unified Identity Management**: All products share a common user identification system using Device ID, User ID, and Amplitude ID, enabling consistent user tracking across the entire platform. This unified identity layer supports cross-product features like behavioral cohorts that can be used for both Analytics segmentation and Experiment targeting.

**Shared Infrastructure**: The platform utilizes common APIs (HTTP V2 API, Batch API, Identify API) and SDK architecture across products, with specialized endpoints for each product's unique functionality. The Ampli code generation system works across all products, providing type-safe implementations for Analytics events, Experiment variants, and Session Replay configurations.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Data Concepts**:
- **Events**: Discrete user actions tracked within applications (e.g., "Purchase Completed", "Video Played")
- **Event Properties**: Contextual metadata associated with events (e.g., product_category, video_duration)
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes associated with user profiles (e.g., subscription_tier, geographic_region)
- **Amplitude ID**: Internal unified identifier that merges device and user identities across sessions and platforms

**Analytics Terminology**:
- **Cohorts**: User groups defined by shared characteristics or behavioral patterns
- **Segments**: Dynamic user filters based on properties and actions
- **Active Users**: Users who performed any tracked event within specified time periods
- **Monthly Tracked Users (MTUs)**: Primary billing metric representing unique users tracked per calendar month
- **Conversion Windows**: Time boundaries for measuring funnel completion and user journey analysis

**Experimentation Framework**:
- **Variants**: Different experience versions within experiments (control group, treatment variations)
- **Exposure Events**: User encounters with experiment variants, distinct from assignment events
- **Bucketing**: Process of assigning users to experiment variants using deterministic algorithms
- **Sequential Testing**: Statistical methodology enabling continuous experiment monitoring without predetermined sample sizes
- **Mutual Exclusion Groups**: Traffic management system preventing users from exposure to conflicting experiments

**Data Governance**:
- **Tracking Plans**: Schema definitions specifying event structures, property types, and validation rules
- **Ampli**: Code generation tool creating strongly-typed SDK wrappers from tracking plan definitions
- **Branches**: Git-like versioning system for tracking plan management and deployment
- **Transformations**: Retroactive data structure modifications applied at query time

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude positions itself as a central analytics hub within the modern data stack, designed to integrate with existing organizational infrastructure rather than replace it. The platform connects to data warehouses through warehouse-native capabilities, enabling direct querying of existing data while maintaining Amplitude's analytical capabilities.

**SDK and API Coverage**: Comprehensive platform support includes JavaScript/TypeScript (Browser), mobile native (iOS Swift, Android Kotlin), cross-platform (React Native, Flutter, Unity), server-side (Node.js, Python, Java, Go), and specialized implementations for gaming (Unity, Unreal Engine) and emerging platforms.

**Third-Party Integrations**: The platform maintains extensive integration capabilities with marketing automation platforms (HubSpot, Braze, Salesforce), advertising networks (Google Ads, Facebook Ads), data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift), and development tools (GitHub, Slack, Jira) through both source and destination catalogs.

**Enterprise Infrastructure**: Advanced features include SSO integration with major identity providers (Okta, Azure AD, Google Workspace), SCIM 2.0 provisioning, comprehensive privacy compliance (GDPR, CCPA), and regional data residency options with dedicated EU infrastructure.
