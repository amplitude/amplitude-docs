Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP), all supported by extensive SDK libraries and API integrations.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem is built around several core product areas that work together to provide end-to-end analytics and optimization capabilities:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational product, offering comprehensive behavioral analytics through multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Personas, Stickiness, Compass, Impact Analysis, Revenue LTV, Engagement Matrix, Data Tables, and Experiment Results. These charts share common measurement methodologies, custom formula capabilities, and segmentation approaches.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with dedicated sections for workflow management, advanced techniques, experiment theory, troubleshooting, and "under the hood" technical details. The experiment platform integrates closely with analytics for results measurement and includes specialized SDKs for implementation.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user session recordings to provide qualitative insights complementing quantitative analytics data.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product messaging and user feedback collection through targeted campaigns and survey deployment.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation through source catalogs, destination catalogs, audiences, and warehouse-native capabilities.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Collections**: Content organization structure that groups related documentation by product area, feature set, or user journey stage.

**Mount Points**: UUID-based identifiers that link collections to specific content repositories, enabling modular content management.

**Navigation Injection**: System for dynamically assigning content to specific navigation categories (analytics, experiment, data, apis, etc.) through the `nav_title` parameter.

**Route Patterns**: URL structure definitions using slug-based routing with hierarchical organization (e.g., `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/{slug}`).

**Blade Attribution**: Product branding system that associates content with specific Amplitude products through the `blade` parameter.

**Sites and Propagation**: Multi-language content management supporting English (`en`) and Japanese (`jp`) localization with propagation controls.

**Preview Targets**: Content preview system enabling real-time content review through permalink-based URLs with refresh capabilities.

**Date Behavior**: Content visibility controls distinguishing between public past content and private future content for publication workflows.

**Taxonomies**: Content categorization system, particularly for integration catalogs using `integration_category` classifications.

## SDK and API Ecosystem

The platform provides extensive developer tooling through multiple SDK categories:

**Analytics SDKs** support major platforms including Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine, all following consistent implementation patterns and sharing common instrumentation approaches.

**Experiment SDKs** provide specialized tooling for feature flag and experimentation implementation across development environments.

**Ampli** serves as a type-safe analytics wrapper that generates strongly-typed tracking libraries from Amplitude's tracking plans.

**APIs** include Analytics API, Experiment APIs, and Guides and Surveys API, providing programmatic access to platform functionality and data.

## Content Organization and User Journeys

The documentation architecture supports multiple user personas and use cases:

**Get Started** content provides onboarding flows for new users, including instrumentation guidance and migration resources for users transitioning from other platforms.

**Administrative Functions** cover account management, billing and usage monitoring, and single sign-on configuration for enterprise deployments.

**Developer Resources** include comprehensive SDK documentation, API references, troubleshooting guides, and integration catalogs for both data sources and destinations.

**Advanced Features** encompass specialized analytics techniques, experiment methodology, data management, and partner integrations.

**Academy Content** provides educational resources and best practices for platform utilization.

The platform's modular architecture enables organizations to adopt individual components or implement the full suite, with consistent data models and integration patterns across all products. Route structures follow logical hierarchies (e.g., `/sdks/analytics/{platform}`, `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}`, `/feature-experiment/{workflow-stage}`) that mirror user mental models and workflow progressions.
