- Extensive integration capabilities with other tools and platforms
- Real-time data processing and analysis

Primary use cases include product analytics, user journey optimization, feature experimentation, conversion optimization, retention analysis, and data-driven decision making across product and marketing teams.

## Product Relationships and Features

The Amplitude product suite consists of several interconnected components:

1. **Analytics Platform**
   - Core analytics engine for processing and visualizing user behavior data
   - Specialized chart types (Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, Event Segmentation)
   - Behavioral cohort creation and analysis
   - Session replay capabilities for qualitative insights
   - Serves as the foundation for other Amplitude products

2. **Experiment Platform**
   - Feature flag management and A/B testing framework
   - Integrates with Analytics for measuring experiment results
   - Supports advanced experimentation techniques like multi-armed bandits
   - Provides statistical analysis of experiment outcomes

3. **CDP (Customer Data Platform)**
   - Manages user profiles and identity resolution
   - Creates and manages audience segments
   - Connects with data sources and destinations
   - Handles PII (Personally Identifiable Information) management

4. **SDK Ecosystem**
   - Client-side SDKs: Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal
   - Server-side SDKs: Node.js, Python, Java, Go
   - Ampli SDK: Type-safe wrapper for consistent instrumentation
   - Specialized SDKs for Experiment implementation

5. **Data Management**
   - Data governance and quality controls
   - Integration with data warehouses
   - Data tables and SQL access
   - Warehouse-native capabilities for direct data loading

6. **Administrative Tools**
   - Organization and project management
   - User permissions and access controls
   - Billing and usage monitoring
   - Single Sign-On (SSO) integration

The products are designed to work together in a cohesive workflow: data is collected via SDKs, processed in Analytics, used for experimentation in Experiment, managed in CDP, and activated through integrations with external systems.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Analytics Terminology
- **Event**: A discrete user action or system occurrence tracked in Amplitude
- **User**: An individual using a product, identified by a unique ID
- **Session**: A period of continuous user engagement
- **Funnel**: A sequence of events representing a user journey or conversion path
- **Retention**: Measurement of user return behavior over time

- **Cohort**: A group of users who share common characteristics or behaviors
- **Property**: Metadata associated with events or users

### Experimentation Terminology
- **Experiment**: A controlled test comparing variations of a feature
- **Variant**: A specific version of a feature being tested
- **Control**: The baseline version in an experiment
- **Impact Analysis**: Measurement of experiment effects on key metrics
- **Feature Flag**: Configuration toggle used to enable/disable features

### Data Management Terminology
- **Source**: Origin point of data (e.g., website, mobile app)
- **Destination**: Target system receiving data from Amplitude
