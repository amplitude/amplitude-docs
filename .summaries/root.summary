Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior through event-based data collection, advanced analytics, and feature experimentation. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP), all unified through a common data infrastructure and SDK ecosystem.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

### Core Analytics Platform
Amplitude Analytics serves as the foundation, providing event-based tracking through multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Pathfinder, Journeys, and specialized charts like Compass, Lifecycle, Personas, and Revenue LTV. The platform supports both individual user-level and account-level analytics through its Accounts add-on, enabling group-level analysis with up to 5 group types per project and 1000 account-level properties.

### Experimentation Suite
Amplitude Experiment provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced statistical analysis. The platform includes experiment theory documentation, advanced techniques, workflow management, and comprehensive result analysis through dedicated experiment results charts. Integration occurs through specialized Experiment SDKs and APIs, with troubleshooting resources and "under the hood" technical documentation.

### Data Infrastructure
The Customer Data Platform (CDP) manages data flow through source and destination catalogs, audience management, and warehouse-native capabilities. The platform supports extensive integrations through taxonomized source and destination catalogs, with specialized PII integrations for privacy compliance.

### Supplementary Products
- **Session Replay**: Qualitative user session recordings synchronized with event streams
- **Guides and Surveys**: In-app messaging and user feedback collection with dedicated APIs
- **Partners**: Third-party integration ecosystem with comprehensive partner documentation

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Analytics Terminology
- **Behavioral Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments based on actions and properties within specific time periods
- **Group Types/Values**: Core components of account-level reporting where types represent categories and values represent specific instances
- **Historical Count**: Feature tracking the Nth occurrence (up to 5th) of user actions with one-year lookback
- **Microscope**: Interactive data exploration tool for drill-down analysis and cohort creation
- **Spaces**: Collaboration framework with permission levels and team sharing capabilities

### Technical Architecture
- **Plugin Architecture**: Modern SDK design pattern supporting enrichment and destination plugins
- **PersistentStorage**: Modern storage implementation replacing legacy SQLite backends
- **Configuration Objects**: Modern initialization pattern replacing instance-based SDK setup
- **Ampli**: Code generation tool creating strongly-typed event tracking from tracking plans
- **Mount Points**: Content management system linking collections to specific UUID-based content structures

### Experimentation Framework
- **Feature Flags**: Boolean toggles for feature rollouts and experimentation
- **Variants**: Different versions of features being tested in experiments
- **Statistical Significance**: Confidence levels for experiment result validation
- **Holdout Groups**: Control populations for measuring overall experiment impact

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

### Multi-Platform SDK Architecture
The platform provides comprehensive SDK coverage across platforms:
- **Analytics SDKs**: Android, iOS (Swift), Browser/JavaScript, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, Unreal
- **Experiment SDKs**: Dedicated experimentation SDKs for feature flag management
- **Unified SDKs**: Beta implementations consolidating Analytics, Experiment, and Session Replay

### API Infrastructure
- **Analytics APIs**: HTTP V2, Batch, Identify, Group Identify for event ingestion and user management
- **Experiment APIs**: Feature flag configuration, variant assignment, and result tracking
- **Guides and Surveys APIs**: In-app messaging and survey management
- **Dashboard REST API**: External data access and integration capabilities

### Data Management and Privacy
The platform emphasizes privacy compliance through:
- **Tracking Options**: COPPA, IDFA, carrier, and location data controls
- **EU Data Residency**: Regional data storage through serverZone configuration
- **SSL Pinning**: Enhanced security for data transmission
- **Apple Privacy Manifests**: iOS privacy compliance integration

## Content Management and Documentation Structure

### Hierarchical Organization
The documentation employs a sophisticated content management system with:
- **Collections**: Organized by product area (analytics, experiment, data, sdks, apis)
- **Mount Points**: UUID-based content linking for dynamic organization
- **Route Structures**: SEO-friendly URL patterns following product hierarchy
- **Navigation Injection**: Contextual navigation based on content type

### Internationalization
- **Multi-site Support**: English (en) and Japanese (jp) localization
- **Content Propagation**: Selective content sharing across language sites
- **Localized Routing**: Language-specific URL structures and navigation

### Content Types and Templates
- **Technical Documentation**: SDK guides, API references, implementation tutorials
- **Product Guides**: Feature explanations, workflow documentation, best practices
- **Administrative Content**: Account management, billing, single sign-on configuration
- **Educational Resources**: Academy content, FAQ, troubleshooting guides

## Command Line and Development Tools

### Ampli CLI Operations
- `ampli pull`: Synchronize tracking plans and generate type-safe code
- `ampli status`: Validate implementation against tracking plans
- Configuration management through LoadOptions and EventOptions

### SDK Installation Methods
- **Package Managers**: CocoaPods, Swift Package Manager, npm, Maven, pip, go get
- **CDN Integration**: Browser SDK via script tags and CDN distribution
- **Framework Support**: React, Angular, Vue.js, Unity, Unreal Engine

### Development and Debugging
- **Ingestion Debugger**: Real-time event validation and troubleshooting
- **User Lookup**: Individual user journey analysis
- **Chrome Extension**: Instrumentation validation and debugging tools
- **Migration Utilities**: Legacy to modern SDK transition support

The platform's architecture supports both real-time analytics through live event updates and historical analysis with configurable retention periods, while maintaining backward compatibility throughout the evolution from legacy to modern implementations across all product areas.
