# Amplitude Analytics Platform

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics platform that provides event tracking, user behavior analysis, experimentation, and customer data management capabilities. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment (A/B testing), Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP) with extensive SDK support and API integrations.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

### Core Platform Components

**Analytics** serves as the foundational product, providing event tracking, user segmentation, and behavioral analysis through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Personas, Stickiness, Compass, Data Tables, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, Revenue LTV, and Experiment Results. Legacy chart types are maintained for backward compatibility.

**Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced statistical analysis, including experiment theory, workflow management, advanced techniques, troubleshooting, and "under the hood" technical implementation details. The platform supports both feature experiments and web experiments with comprehensive result analysis.

**Session Replay** captures and analyzes user session recordings for qualitative insights into user behavior and experience optimization.

**Guides and Surveys** enables in-product messaging, user onboarding flows, and feedback collection through targeted surveys and interactive guides.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation through source and destination catalogs, audience management, and warehouse-native integrations.

### SDK and Integration Ecosystem

The platform provides extensive SDK support across multiple programming languages and platforms:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal implementations, each following platform-specific conventions while maintaining consistent core functionality.

**Experiment SDKs** provide feature flag evaluation and experiment assignment across the same platform ecosystem with specialized APIs for experiment management.

**Ampli** serves as a code generation tool that creates strongly-typed wrappers around tracking implementations, ensuring data quality and consistency across development teams.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Core Analytics Concepts
- **Events**: User actions tracked within applications (e.g., button clicks, page views, purchases)
- **Properties**: Metadata associated with events (event properties) or users (user properties)
- **Segments**: Filtered subsets of users based on behavior or characteristics
- **Cohorts**: Time-based user groupings for retention and lifecycle analysis
- **Funnels**: Sequential event flows measuring conversion rates
- **Journeys**: User path analysis showing navigation patterns

### Data Management Terminology
- **Sources**: Data ingestion points from various platforms and applications
- **Destinations**: Data export endpoints for activation and analysis
- **Audiences**: Behavioral segments that can be synced to external platforms
- **Warehouse-native**: Direct integration with data warehouses for analysis
- **PII (Personally Identifiable Information)**: Sensitive user data requiring special handling

### Experimentation Framework
- **Feature Flags**: Boolean toggles controlling feature availability
- **Variants**: Different versions of features being tested
- **Allocation**: Percentage of users assigned to each variant
- **Statistical Significance**: Confidence level in experiment results
- **Lift**: Percentage improvement in key metrics

### Administrative Concepts
- **Organizations**: Top-level account containers
- **Projects**: Individual application or product tracking containers
- **API Keys**: Authentication tokens for SDK and API access
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Enterprise authentication integration
- **Billing and Usage**: Consumption tracking and plan management

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

### Multi-Product Workflows
The platform enables integrated workflows where Analytics data informs Experiment targeting, Session Replay provides qualitative context for quantitative findings, and Guides and Surveys collect direct user feedback. The CDP serves as the central data hub, ensuring consistent user identification and event tracking across all products.

### Enterprise Integration
**Single Sign-On** integration supports SAML and OIDC protocols for enterprise authentication. **Account Management** provides role-based access control, team management, and project governance. **Billing and Usage** tracking enables consumption monitoring and cost optimization across the platform.

### Data Pipeline Architecture
The platform processes events through a real-time data pipeline supporting both streaming and batch processing. **Sources** ingest data from web, mobile, server-side, and third-party platforms. **Destinations** enable data activation through marketing tools, data warehouses, and business intelligence platforms.

### Developer Experience
**Migration** tools and documentation support transitions between SDK versions and from competitor platforms. **FAQ and Troubleshooting** resources provide comprehensive support for implementation challenges. **Academy Content** offers educational resources for analytics best practices and platform optimization.

## API Endpoints and Command Line Interfaces

### Analytics APIs
- **HTTP V2 API**: Primary event ingestion endpoint (`/2/httpapi`)
- **Export API**: Bulk data export for analysis and backup
- **Cohort API**: Programmatic audience management
- **Dashboard API**: Chart and dashboard configuration management

### Experiment APIs
- **Flag Evaluation API**: Real-time feature flag resolution
- **Assignment API**: Experiment variant assignment
- **Results API**: Statistical analysis and reporting
- **Management API**: Experiment configuration and lifecycle management

### Guides and Surveys API
- **Content Management API**: Survey and guide creation/modification
- **Targeting API**: Audience and trigger configuration
- **Response API**: Survey response collection and analysis

### SDK Integration Patterns
All SDKs follow consistent initialization patterns:
```
amplitude.init(apiKey, options)
amplitude.track(eventType, properties)
amplitude.identify(userId, userProperties)
```

**Ampli CLI** provides code generation commands:
- `ampli pull`: Download tracking plan schemas
- `ampli status`: Validate implementation compliance
- `ampli codegen`: Generate typed tracking interfaces

### Administrative APIs
- **User Management API**: Account and permission management
- **Usage API**: Consumption tracking and billing integration
- **Audit API**: Activity logging and compliance reporting

The platform supports both REST and GraphQL API patterns depending on the specific service, with comprehensive authentication through API keys, OAuth, and session-based authentication for different use cases.
