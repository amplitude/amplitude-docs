These products are supported by extensive implementation options including multiple SDKs and APIs, along with administrative functions for account management, billing, and authentication.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Analytics Terms
- **Event**: A tracked user action or system occurrence that forms the basis of analytics data
- **User Property**: Attributes associated with specific users that provide context for analysis
- **Cohort**: A group of users sharing common characteristics used for comparative analysis
- **Segment**: A defined subset of users based on specific criteria for targeted analysis
- **Funnel**: Sequential steps users take toward a conversion goal, used to identify drop-off points
- **Retention**: Measurement of returning users over time, indicating product stickiness
- **Session**: A period of continuous user activity, used to understand engagement patterns
- **LTV** (Lifetime Value): The total value a user provides to the business over their relationship

### Experiment Terms
- **Variant**: A version of a feature being tested in an experiment
- **Control**: The baseline version in an experiment used for comparison
- **Exposure**: The moment when a user encounters an experiment
- **Conversion**: Completion of a desired action that indicates experiment success
- **Statistical Significance**: The confidence level in experiment results, indicating reliability

### Data Terms
- **Source**: Origin point of data imported into Amplitude
- **Destination**: External system receiving Amplitude data
- **Warehouse-Native**: Direct integration with data warehouses for efficient data management
- **Integration**: Connection between Amplitude and third-party systems for data exchange

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's products form a cohesive ecosystem with several key integration points:

1. **Analytics + Experiment**: Analytics data informs experiment design by identifying opportunities, while experiment results feed back into analytics for comprehensive understanding of feature impact.

2. **CDP + Analytics**: The Customer Data Platform manages user data that supports more sophisticated analytics, enabling better segmentation and personalization.

3. **Session Replay + Analytics**: Quantitative analytics data is enhanced with qualitative session recordings, providing visual context for user behavior patterns.

4. **Guides and Surveys + Analytics**: User feedback collected through in-product messaging is analyzed alongside behavioral data for a complete picture of user experience.

The platform integrates with external systems including:
- Data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift)
- Marketing platforms for campaign optimization
- Customer support tools for service improvement
- Development tools (GitHub, Jira) for workflow integration
- Business intelligence platforms for extended reporting
