Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize digital experiences, and drive product growth through data-driven insights and controlled experimentation.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of four interconnected products that form a complete analytics and optimization ecosystem:

**Analytics** serves as the foundational behavioral analytics engine, providing deep insights into user interactions through specialized chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Compass, Data Tables, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, Lifecycle, Personas, Revenue LTV, Stickiness, and Experiment Results. This product focuses on understanding user journeys, conversion patterns, and engagement metrics across digital properties.

**Data** functions as the central integration hub, orchestrating data flow between Amplitude and existing technology stacks. It encompasses Sources for data ingestion, Audiences for user segmentation, warehouse-native capabilities for direct data warehouse integration, and comprehensive source and destination catalogs with categorized integrations. This product ensures seamless data collection, transformation, and distribution across business systems.

**Experiment** delivers A/B testing and feature flag capabilities, enabling teams to validate hypotheses, test product changes, and optimize user experiences through controlled experimentation. The product includes advanced experimentation techniques, statistical theory, workflow management, troubleshooting tools, and detailed technical implementation guidance.

**Session Replay** provides digital experience reconstruction by capturing and replaying actual user sessions, adding visual context to quantitative analytics data and helping teams understand the behavioral drivers behind user actions.

## Technical Implementation Framework

### SDK Ecosystem
Amplitude maintains extensive SDK coverage across development platforms:
- **Web/Browser**: Browser SDK with integrated session replay capabilities
- **Mobile**: Native Android SDK, iOS SDK, cross-platform React Native SDK, and Flutter SDK
- **Gaming**: Unity SDK and Unreal SDK for game analytics
- **Server-side**: Node.js SDK, Python SDK, Java SDK, and Go SDK for backend implementation
- **Code Generation**: Ampli for type-safe analytics implementation with compile-time validation
- **Framework Integrations**: Specialized integrations for popular development frameworks

### API Infrastructure
The platform exposes multiple API endpoints organized by product area:
- **Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/`) for data querying, chart configuration, and analytics management
- **Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) for feature flag management, experiment configuration, and results retrieval
- **Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) for in-app messaging and user engagement tools

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Collections Structure**: Documentation is organized into product-specific collections with defined routing patterns (`/analytics/charts/{slug}`, `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/{slug}`, `/feature-experiment/{slug}`), enabling structured content delivery and navigation.

**Navigation Taxonomy**: Content categorization uses `nav_title` injection for consistent grouping across analytics, data, experiment, APIs, analytics SDKs, experiment SDKs, and administrative sections.

**Mount Points**: Collections utilize mount identifiers for content management, indicating hierarchical relationships and structured content organization within the documentation system.

**Blade System**: Product-specific branding through blade injection creates distinct experiences for "Amplitude Experiment", "Amplitude Session Replay", and "Amplitude Guides and Surveys" while maintaining platform cohesion.

**Site Localization**: Multi-site architecture supports English (`en`) as primary language with Japanese (`jp`) translation capabilities, managed through site-specific content propagation.

**Content Propagation**: Site-specific content distribution controlled through propagate flags and site arrays, enabling targeted documentation delivery.

## Ecosystem Integration and Platform Organization

### Enterprise and Administrative Capabilities
The platform includes comprehensive enterprise features:
- **Account Management** (`/admin/account-management/`) for organizational settings and user administration
- **Single Sign-on** (`/admin/single-sign-on/`) for enterprise authentication integration
- **Billing and Use** (`/admin/billing-use/`) for usage monitoring and subscription management

### Developer Experience
Developer resources are structured to support implementation and adoption:
- **Get Started** sections for product onboarding and initial setup
- **Migration** guidance for transitioning from other analytics platforms
- **Instrumentation** best practices for data collection implementation
- **FAQ and Troubleshooting** for common implementation challenges

### Partner and Integration Ecosystem
The platform maintains extensive third-party connectivity:
- **Partners** section documenting third-party integrations and marketplace solutions
- **Destination Catalog** and **Source Catalog** with categorized integration options
- **PII Integrations** for privacy-compliant data handling and regulatory compliance

### Educational and Engagement Content
- **Academy Content** providing structured learning resources and certification programs
- **Guides and Surveys** for in-app user engagement and feedback collection strategies

The routing architecture reveals API endpoints following the pattern `/apis/{product}/{slug}` and SDK documentation at `/sdks/{product}/{platform}/{slug}`, indicating a developer-centric organization. The presence of preview targets, date-based content behavior, and structured navigation demonstrates a mature documentation platform designed to serve both technical implementers and business users throughout the complete analytics and experimentation lifecycle.
