Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Data, Session Replay, and Guides & Surveys, all built on a unified event-based data architecture.

## Core Product Architecture and Features

**Analytics Platform**
Amplitude Analytics serves as the primary behavioral analytics engine, offering multiple chart types for different analytical needs:
- **Event Segmentation**: Measures user actions and behaviors with advanced filtering and grouping capabilities
- **Funnel Analysis**: Tracks conversion rates through multi-step user journeys with time-based analysis
- **Retention Analysis**: Measures user engagement over time using N-Day, Unbounded, and Bracket retention methodologies
- **User Sessions**: Analyzes session-based metrics including duration, depth, and engagement patterns
- **Journeys**: Visualizes user paths through products with Sankey diagram representations
- **Personas**: Creates behavioral user segments using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) clustering algorithms
- **Compass**: Provides automated insights and anomaly detection across key metrics
- **Data Tables**: Enables multi-dimensional analysis with pivot table functionality
- **Lifecycle**: Tracks user progression through New, Current, Returning, and Dormant states
- **Stickiness**: Measures user engagement frequency within specified time periods
- **Revenue LTV**: Calculates customer lifetime value with cohort-based revenue analysis
- **Engagement Matrix**: Visualizes user engagement patterns across frequency and recency dimensions
- **Impact Analysis**: Measures the statistical impact of user actions on key business metrics

**Experimentation Platform**
Amplitude Experiment provides A/B testing and feature flagging capabilities with advanced statistical methodologies:
- **Sequential Testing**: Uses always-valid p-values for continuous monitoring without multiple testing penalties
- **Mutual Exclusion Groups**: Prevents users from being assigned to multiple conflicting experiments
- **Advanced Targeting**: Supports complex user segmentation with behavioral and demographic criteria
- **Statistical Engine**: Implements both Frequentist and Bayesian approaches with configurable significance thresholds
- **Feature Flags**: Enables gradual rollouts and instant rollbacks with real-time configuration updates

**Data Management Platform**
Amplitude Data serves as the governance layer with comprehensive tracking plan management:
- **Tracking Plans**: Structured schemas defining events, properties, and data validation rules
- **Ampli Developer Tools**: Generate type-safe tracking libraries with autocompletion and compile-time validation
- **Data Governance**: Implements blocking, hiding, and deletion capabilities for data quality management
- **Schema Validation**: Monitors incoming data against defined schemas with violation reporting
- **Transformations**: Enables retroactive data modifications including event merging and property renaming

## Product Relationships and Integration

The Amplitude ecosystem operates as an integrated platform where data flows seamlessly between products:

**Data Foundation**: Amplitude Data provides the foundational schema and governance layer that feeds into all other products. Tracking plans created in Data generate the events and properties used across Analytics, Experiment, and other products.

**Analytics Integration**: Charts and analyses in Analytics consume data validated and structured through Amplitude Data. Cohorts created in Analytics can be used for experiment targeting in Amplitude Experiment.

**Experiment Integration**: Experiment results are analyzed using Analytics charts, particularly the Experiment Results chart type. Feature flag assignments become events that can be analyzed across all Analytics capabilities.

**Session Replay Integration**: Session recordings are linked to Analytics events, enabling teams to investigate user behavior patterns identified in charts by watching actual user sessions.

**Cross-Product Workflows**: The platform supports end-to-end workflows where insights from Analytics inform experiment hypotheses, experiments are configured and run in Experiment, results are analyzed back in Analytics, and user sessions provide qualitative context through Session Replay.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Data Concepts**
- **Events**: Discrete user actions or system occurrences with associated timestamps and properties
- **Event Properties**: Attributes specific to individual event instances (e.g., product_name, purchase_amount)
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes of users that update over time (e.g., subscription_status, device_type)
- **Group Properties**: Account or organization-level attributes available with the Accounts add-on
- **Amplitude ID**: Unique identifier automatically assigned to each user for cross-device tracking
- **Monthly Tracked Users (MTUs)**: Primary billing metric representing unique users performing events in a calendar month

**Analytics Terminology**
- **Behavioral Cohorts**: Dynamic or static user segments based on behavioral criteria, exportable via API
- **Active Users**: Users who performed at least one active event within a specified time period
- **Conversion Windows**: Time periods within which users must complete funnel steps or retention actions
- **Segments**: Filtered subsets of users or events based on property values or behavioral criteria
- **Group-by Properties**: Dimensions used to break down analysis results into multiple series

**Experimentation Terminology**
- **Variants**: Different versions of features or experiences being tested in experiments
- **Allocation**: Percentage of traffic assigned to experiments and specific variants
- **Exposure Events**: Events indicating when users encounter experiment variants
- **Primary Metrics**: Key performance indicators used to measure experiment success
- **Secondary Metrics**: Additional metrics monitored for experiment impact assessment
- **Statistical Significance**: Confidence level (typically 95%) that observed differences aren't due to chance

**Data Governance Terminology**
- **Schema Violations**: Events or properties that don't match defined tracking plan specifications
- **Blocking**: Preventing data ingestion for specific events or properties
- **Hiding**: Removing events or properties from UI while preserving historical data
- **Transformations**: Retroactive modifications to event and property structures
- **Derived Properties**: Calculated properties created using formulas applied to existing data

## Broader Product Ecosystem

Amplitude operates within a comprehensive product analytics ecosystem that includes:

**Data Ingestion Layer**: Multiple SDKs (Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal, Node.js, Python, Java, Go), HTTP APIs, and third-party integrations (Segment, mParticle) for data collection.

**Storage and Processing**: Event-based data architecture with immutable storage, pre-aggregated datasets, and real-time processing capabilities supporting high-volume data ingestion.

**Analysis and Visualization**: Rich charting capabilities with interactive filtering, custom date ranges, statistical functions, and export capabilities to CSV, PDF, and API formats.

**Activation and Orchestration**: Cohort exports to marketing platforms, webhook integrations, and real-time data streaming to downstream tools for marketing automation and personalization.

**Governance and Compliance**: SOC2 Type 2, GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA compliance with data processing agreements, privacy controls, and audit capabilities.
