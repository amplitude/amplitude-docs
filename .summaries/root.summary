Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and make data-driven decisions through advanced analytics, feature experimentation, and customer data management capabilities.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of several interconnected products that form a unified analytics ecosystem:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational product for behavioral analytics, offering sophisticated charting capabilities including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Cohort Analysis (Lifecycle), Revenue LTV tracking, Stickiness analysis, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Personas, Journeys, Data Tables, and Compass analytics. Legacy chart types are maintained for backward compatibility.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with both remote and local evaluation modes, statistical analysis through sequential testing methodologies, and advanced experiment management including flag dependencies and mutual exclusion groups.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user session recordings for qualitative insights into user behavior patterns and experience optimization.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user engagement through targeted messaging and feedback collection mechanisms.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation through comprehensive source and destination catalogs, audience management, and warehouse-native capabilities.

## Data Infrastructure and Integration Framework

The platform operates through a sophisticated data architecture supporting multiple ingestion methods:

**SDK Ecosystem** includes comprehensive instrumentation libraries for major platforms:
- Client-side SDKs: Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal
- Server-side SDKs: Node.js, Python, Java, Go
- Code generation tool: Ampli for type-safe analytics implementation

**API Infrastructure** provides programmatic access through:
- Analytics API (`/apis/analytics/`) for data ingestion and retrieval
- Experiment APIs (`/apis/experiment/`) for feature flag management
- Guides and Surveys API (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) for campaign management

**Data Connectors** facilitate ecosystem integration through:
- Source Catalog: Pre-built connectors for data ingestion from external platforms
- Destination Catalog: Data activation endpoints for downstream systems
- Partner integrations for extended functionality

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** represent discrete user actions tracked within the platform, forming the foundation for all analytics calculations.

**User Properties** store persistent attributes about users, while **Event Properties** capture contextual information about specific actions.

**Cohorts** define user segments based on behavioral criteria or property values, enabling targeted analysis and experimentation.

**Experiments** encompass A/B tests and feature flags, with **Variants** representing different user experiences and **Assignment** determining user allocation to experimental conditions.

**Charts** refer to specific analytical visualizations, each optimized for particular analytical use cases and supporting various metric calculations.

**Taxonomies** organize integrations by category, particularly within source and destination catalogs for improved discoverability.

## Route Structure and Navigation

The platform documentation follows a hierarchical URL structure:

- `/analytics/` - Core analytics functionality and chart types
- `/feature-experiment/` - Experiment management, theory, and advanced techniques  
- `/sdks/` - SDK documentation organized by platform and purpose
- `/apis/` - API reference documentation
- `/data/` - CDP functionality including sources, destinations, and audiences
- `/admin/` - Administrative functions including account management, billing, and SSO
- `/get-started/` - Onboarding and migration resources

Specialized routes include `/session-replay/`, `/guides-and-surveys/`, `/web-experiment/`, and `/partners/` for respective product areas.

## Advanced Analytics Capabilities

**Statistical Analysis** employs sophisticated methodologies including mixture sequential probability ratio testing (mSPRT) for experiment analysis, enabling valid conclusions without predetermined sample sizes.

**Behavioral Analysis** supports complex user journey mapping through funnel analysis, retention cohorts, and lifecycle stage tracking.

**Revenue Analytics** provides comprehensive LTV calculations, revenue attribution, and monetization insights.

**Real-time Processing** enables immediate data availability for operational analytics and rapid experiment iteration.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** (`/admin/account-management/`) provides organizational controls and user administration.

**Single Sign-On** (`/admin/single-sign-on/`) enables enterprise authentication integration.

**Billing and Usage** (`/admin/billing-use/`) offers consumption monitoring and cost management tools.

**PII Management** (`/data/pii/`) ensures compliance with privacy regulations through specialized data handling procedures.

## Global Platform Support

The platform supports internationalization with dedicated Japanese language content (`sites: jp`) and multi-regional deployment capabilities. Academy content provides educational resources, while comprehensive FAQ and troubleshooting documentation supports user success.

**Migration Tools** facilitate platform adoption from competing analytics solutions, with specialized guidance for data transition and SDK implementation.

The platform represents a comprehensive solution for product analytics, experimentation, and customer data management, enabling organizations to build data-driven product experiences through sophisticated measurement, testing, and optimization capabilities across the entire product development lifecycle.
