Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with integrated tools for product analytics, feature experimentation, customer data management, and user engagement optimization. The platform serves as a unified ecosystem for understanding user behavior, testing product changes, and driving data-driven decision making across web and mobile applications.

## Core Product Architecture and Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem consists of four interconnected product modules that work synergistically to provide end-to-end analytics and optimization capabilities:

**Amplitude Analytics** functions as the foundational analytics engine, built around event-based tracking and user behavioral analysis. It provides sophisticated visualization through Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, Cohort Analysis, and User Journey mapping. The platform includes advanced analytical features like Compass for automated insights, Personas for behavioral cohorts, and Revenue LTV analysis for monetization tracking.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities that integrate directly with the analytics platform. This enables teams to safely deploy features, conduct sophisticated experiments, and measure impact using the same event data that powers analytics. The experimentation platform includes statistical analysis engines, advanced bucketing algorithms, and comprehensive experiment evaluation tools.

**Amplitude CDP (Customer Data Platform)** manages the entire data lifecycle from ingestion to activation. It orchestrates data flow between sources and destinations, manages audience creation and synchronization, and provides data governance capabilities including PII handling and warehouse-native processing. The CDP serves as the data backbone that powers both analytics and experimentation.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user interactions at the session level, providing granular insight into user behavior that complements the aggregate analytics data. This creates a complete picture of user experience from macro-level trends to individual interaction patterns.

Supporting these core modules are **Amplitude Guides and Surveys** for in-product engagement, **Ampli** for type-safe analytics implementation, and a comprehensive SDK ecosystem that ensures consistent data collection across all platforms.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

### Analytics Foundation
**Events** represent discrete user actions and form the atomic unit of all analytics, with **Properties** serving as attributes that enable segmentation and analysis. **Cohorts** define user groups based on shared characteristics or behaviors, while **Funnels** measure sequential user flows and conversion rates. **Retention** tracks user return behavior over time, and **Stickiness** measures engagement frequency within defined periods.

### Experimentation Framework
**Feature Flags** provide boolean controls for enabling/disabling features across user segments, while **Variants** represent different versions of experiences being tested. **Bucketing** describes the algorithmic process of assigning users to experiment groups, with **Statistical Significance** indicating confidence levels in observed differences. **Lift** quantifies percentage improvements of variants compared to control groups.

### Data Management Architecture
**Sources** represent systems that send data into Amplitude, while **Destinations** are external systems receiving data from the platform. **Transformations** apply data processing rules during ingestion or export phases. **Audiences** create dynamically updated user segments that synchronize with external systems. **Warehouse-native** architecture processes data directly within customer data warehouses, enabling advanced data governance and performance optimization.

### Technical Infrastructure
**SDKs (Software Development Kits)** provide client libraries for implementing Amplitude tracking across platforms. **APIs** offer RESTful interfaces for programmatic platform access. **Agents** handle server-side data collection and processing. **Mount Points** serve as content management system references for organizing documentation and resources.

## SDK Ecosystem and Implementation Architecture

The platform maintains extensive SDK coverage across development environments:

**Client-Side SDKs** include the Browser SDK for JavaScript web applications with session replay integration, native Mobile SDKs for iOS and Android platforms, and Cross-Platform SDKs supporting React Native, Flutter, and Unity for hybrid development. Specialized Game Engine SDKs support Unity and Unreal Engine implementations.

**Server-Side SDKs** provide Node.js implementation for JavaScript/TypeScript applications, Python SDK for Python environments, Java SDK for enterprise applications, and Go SDK for lightweight server implementations.

All SDKs implement consistent patterns for initialization, event tracking, user identification, and configuration management, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous operations with automatic retry logic and offline storage capabilities.

## API Infrastructure and Programmatic Access

### Analytics APIs
The Analytics API ecosystem provides comprehensive programmatic access through event ingestion endpoints for real-time data collection, query APIs for retrieving aggregated analytics data, user profile APIs for individual user data access, and export APIs for bulk data extraction.

### Experiment APIs
Experimentation functionality exposes flag evaluation endpoints for real-time feature flag resolution, experiment configuration APIs for managing experiment setup, results APIs for accessing performance data, and assignment APIs for tracking user experiment participation.

### Data Management APIs
CDP functionality includes source and destination configuration management APIs, audience definition and synchronization endpoints, data transformation rule management interfaces, and real-time data streaming APIs.

## Integration Ecosystem and Platform Connectivity

### Source Integrations
The platform integrates with Customer Data Platforms (Segment, mParticle, Tealium), E-commerce Platforms (Shopify, WooCommerce, Magento), Marketing Tools (Braze, Iterable, Salesforce Marketing Cloud), and provides migration tools from other analytics platforms including Mixpanel and Google Analytics.

### Destination Integrations
Data activation occurs through integrations with Advertising Platforms (Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads), Email Marketing systems (Mailchimp, SendGrid, Klaviyo), Customer Support tools (Zendesk, Intercom, Freshdesk), and Data Warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift).

### Enterprise Infrastructure
Enterprise capabilities include Single Sign-On (SSO) with SAML and OAuth integration, comprehensive data governance with PII detection and retention policies, security compliance including SOC 2 certification, and scalable infrastructure with dedicated resources and priority support.

## Operational Framework and Administration

The platform provides comprehensive account management including user provisioning, role-based access control, team organization, and billing management across multiple projects with API key management and data governance policy configuration.

**Billing operates on usage-based models** tracking Monthly Tracked Users (MTU) as the primary analytics metric, Event Volume for high-volume implementations, Experiment Impressions for experimentation features, and Session Replay Hours for recording capabilities.

**Migration and onboarding infrastructure** includes comprehensive tools for transitioning from other analytics platforms, with specific guidance for Google Analytics and Mixpanel migrations, data mapping utilities, implementation guides, and validation tools to ensure successful platform adoption.

The Amplitude platform represents a mature, enterprise-grade analytics and experimentation ecosystem designed to support organizations at scale while maintaining accessibility for individual contributors and small teams through its integrated approach to data collection, analysis, experimentation, and activation.
