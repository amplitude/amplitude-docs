2. **Destination Catalog** - Send data to marketing, engagement, and business tools
3. **SDK Catalog** - Implementation options for different platforms
4. **Warehouse-Native Integrations** - Direct data warehouse connections

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

1. **Event** - A user action or system occurrence tracked in Amplitude
2. **User Property** - Attributes associated with users (demographics, preferences, etc.)
3. **Cohort** - A group of users sharing common characteristics or behaviors
4. **Funnel** - Sequential steps users take to complete a process
5. **Retention** - Measurement of user return rates over time
6. **Session** - A period of continuous user activity
7. **Experiment** - A controlled test comparing variants of features
8. **Instrumentation** - Process of implementing tracking code
9. **Ampli** - Code generation tool for type-safe analytics implementation
10. **Chart** - Visualization of analytics data (funnel, retention, impact, etc.)

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's platform is designed as an integrated ecosystem where:

1. **Data Collection** occurs through SDKs (Browser, iOS, Android, etc.) or direct integrations
2. **Data Processing** happens in the Data platform with identity resolution and transformation
3. **Analysis** takes place in Analytics with various chart types and visualization tools
4. **Segmentation** creates Audiences based on behavior and properties
5. **Experimentation** tests hypotheses through the Experiment platform
6. **Activation** sends insights and segments to external tools via the Destination Catalog

The platform supports both real-time and batch processing workflows, with capabilities for historical data import and continuous streaming.

## Technical Implementation

### SDK Implementation

Amplitude provides SDKs for various platforms:
- Browser SDK: `amplitude.track("Event Name", {eventProperties})`
- iOS SDK: `Amplitude.instance().logEvent("Event Name", withEventProperties: properties)`
- Android SDK: `Amplitude.getInstance().logEvent("Event Name", eventProperties)`
- React Native SDK: `amplitude.logEvent("Event Name", eventProperties)`
- Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, Unreal, and Flutter SDKs

### API Endpoints

1. **Analytics API**
   - `POST /2/httpapi` - Send events
   - `GET /api/2/users` - Query user data
   - `GET /api/2/events/segmentation` - Event segmentation data

2. **Experiment API**
   - `POST /api/2/exposure` - Log experiment exposures
   - `GET /api/2/variant/{key}` - Fetch variant for a user

3. **Cohort API**
   - `GET /api/3/cohorts` - List cohorts
   - `POST /api/3/cohorts/upload` - Upload users to cohort

The platform architecture supports multi-site implementations with localization capabilities, including Japanese language support, and provides extensive documentation for troubleshooting and advanced implementation techniques.
