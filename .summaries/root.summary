Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to track, analyze, and optimize user behavior across digital products. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Core Product Architecture

The platform operates on a multi-product ecosystem with Analytics serving as the foundational component. Amplitude Analytics provides behavioral analytics through event tracking, user segmentation, and advanced chart visualizations. Amplitude Experiment delivers feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with statistical analysis. Session Replay captures user interactions for qualitative analysis, while Guides and Surveys enables in-product user engagement and feedback collection.

The data architecture centers on events, users, and groups, supporting both individual user analytics and account-level B2B reporting. The platform processes data through multiple ingestion methods including HTTP V2 API, Batch API, and comprehensive SDKs for web, mobile, and server-side implementations across Android, iOS, Browser, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal platforms.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

**Analytics Foundation**: The analytics engine powers multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys (Pathfinder), Lifecycle, Stickiness, Revenue LTV, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Impact Analysis, and Engagement Matrix. These charts integrate with behavioral cohorts, anomaly detection, and forecasting capabilities.

**Experimentation Integration**: Amplitude Experiment connects with Analytics through Experiment Results charts, enabling statistical analysis of A/B tests with advanced techniques like sequential testing and CUPED variance reduction. The platform supports both feature experiments and web experiments with comprehensive SDK coverage.

**Data Management**: The CDP component includes Sources and Destinations catalogs for data integration, Audiences for user segmentation, and warehouse-native capabilities. PII integrations ensure data privacy compliance while maintaining analytical capabilities.

**Developer Tools**: Ampli provides type-safe analytics implementation, while extensive SDK documentation covers instrumentation patterns, troubleshooting, and migration guidance from other platforms.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events and Properties**: Events represent discrete user actions with associated event properties (action-specific) and user properties (persistent attributes). Group properties enable account-level analytics for B2B use cases.

**Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments based on behavioral criteria, supporting temporal parameters (during, since, within) and complex logical operators. Behavioral cohorts update automatically based on user actions.

**Experiments**: Feature flags and A/B tests managed through Amplitude Experiment, with variants, exposures, and statistical analysis. Supports both client-side and server-side experimentation.

**Charts**: Analytical visualizations optimized for specific use cases - Event Segmentation for trends, Funnels for conversion analysis, Retention for lifecycle patterns, and specialized charts for engagement and revenue analysis.

**Sessions**: Configurable periods of user activity with comprehensive metrics including entries, exits, duration, and session-based event analysis.

**Groups**: Account-level entities supporting B2B analytics, with group types (categories) and group values (specific instances). Enables both event-level and user-level group associations.

## Broader Product Ecosystem

Amplitude integrates extensively across the modern data and product stack:

**Data Integration**: Connects with Segment, Salesforce, advertising networks, and data warehouses. Source and Destination catalogs provide pre-built integrations categorized by function (Analytics, Advertising, Data Warehouses, etc.).

**Collaboration Tools**: Deep integrations with Slack, Google Workspace, Notion, Miro, and Atlassian products enable sharing, notifications, and embedded analytics within existing workflows.

**Development Ecosystem**: Chrome Instrumentation Explorer for debugging, comprehensive SDK documentation, migration guides from competitors, and Ampli for type-safe implementation.

**Enterprise Features**: Single Sign-On (SSO) support, account management, billing controls, and organizational permissions enable enterprise deployment.
