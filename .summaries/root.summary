# Amplitude Product Suite

## Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and digital optimization platform that helps businesses understand user behavior, track product performance, and make data-driven decisions. The platform enables companies to collect, analyze, and activate user data to improve product experiences and drive business outcomes.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

The Amplitude platform consists of four integrated core products that work together to provide a complete analytics and optimization solution:

1. **Amplitude Analytics** - The flagship product for analyzing user behavior through various visualization tools:
   - Event Segmentation for detailed event analysis
   - Funnel Analysis for conversion tracking
   - Retention Analysis for measuring user engagement over time
   - User Paths for understanding navigation flows
   - Session Replay for direct observation of user interactions
   - Behavioral Cohorts for grouping users by actions
   - Dashboards for monitoring key metrics
   - Notebooks for collaborative analysis and storytelling

2. **Amplitude Experiment** - A feature experimentation and A/B testing platform that supports:
   - Client-side experimentation (Web Experiment)
   - Server-side experimentation
   - Impact analysis capabilities
   - Integration with Analytics for measuring experiment effects on key metrics

3. **Amplitude Data** - The data management and governance layer that handles:
   - Data collection (Sources)
   - Integrations (Source Catalog and Destination Catalog)
   - PII management
   - Customer Data Platform (CDP) for audience management and activation

4. **Amplitude SDKs** - Platform-specific development kits for data collection across:
   - Web: Browser
   - Mobile: iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter
   - Gaming: Unity, Unreal
   - Server: Node.js, Python, Java, Go
   - Ampli: Amplitude's type-safe wrapper SDK

The platform architecture follows a logical flow from data collection through analysis to activation:
- Data Collection Layer (SDKs and APIs)
- Data Processing Layer (validation and enrichment)
- Analysis Layer (Analytics tools)
- Activation Layer (Experiment and CDP)

Amplitude offers tiered pricing with Plus (basic), Growth (advanced), and Enterprise (complete) options to accommodate different business needs.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### User and Event Tracking
- **Event**: A discrete user action or occurrence tracked in the platform
- **User Property**: Attributes associated with individual users (e.g., demographics, preferences)
- **Group Property**: Attributes associated with accounts or organizations for B2B analysis
- **Session**: Collection of events grouped by time and user activity
- **Cohort**: Group of users sharing common characteristics or behaviors

### Analytics Concepts
- **Historical Count**: Tracking specific instances of user actions
- **Channel Classifiers**: Categorization of traffic sources for attribution
- **Attribution Models**: Methods for crediting marketing channels for conversions
- **Behavioral Offset**: Segmenting audiences based on behaviors across time periods

### Content Organization
- **Spaces**: Collaborative areas for organizing and sharing content
- **Personal Space/Workspace**: Individual user's area for saved analyses
- **Official Content**: Designated source-of-truth dashboards and charts
- **Templates**: Reusable dashboard configurations with customizable parameters

## Technical Integration

### Data Collection Methods
- **SDKs**: Client-side instrumentation for various platforms
- **Server-side APIs**: Identify API, HTTP API for server-side tracking
- **Integrations**: Segment and other third-party data sources
- **Group Identify API**: For creating and updating group properties

### Key API Endpoints
- **HTTP V2 API** (`api2.amplitude.com`): Primary endpoint for sending events
- **Identify API**: For updating user properties
- **Group Identify API**: For creating and updating group properties
- **Experiment APIs**: For feature flag and experiment management

### SDK Configuration Examples
```javascript
// JavaScript SDK with domain proxy
amplitude.init('API_KEY', null, {
    serverUrl: 'https://your-domain.com/amplitude/'
});
```

```java
// Android SDK with domain proxy
Amplitude.getInstance()
    .setServerUrl("https://your-domain.com/amplitude/");
```

### Warehouse-Native Integration
Amplitude supports direct data loading from data warehouses using the Data Warehouse Import feature via S3 or GCS buckets, eliminating the need for API keys in certain integration scenarios.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates with the broader product ecosystem through:

1. **Data Sources**: Integrations with platforms like Segment, mParticle, and direct connections to data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift)
2. **Data Destinations**: Export capabilities to BI tools, marketing platforms, and data warehouses
3. **Authentication Systems**: SSO integration with enterprise identity providers
4. **Development Workflows**: SDK integration with various development frameworks

The platform serves as a central hub for product data, connecting with both upstream data sources and downstream activation platforms to create a complete data lifecycle. This enables businesses to collect data once and activate it across multiple tools and platforms.

## Administration

Amplitude provides comprehensive tools for managing organizations including:
- Single Sign-On for enterprise authentication
- Billing and usage tracking
- User permissions and access controls
- Data governance and PII management

The documentation is available in both English and Japanese, with specialized collections for Japanese translations to support global users.
