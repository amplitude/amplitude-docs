Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven decision making.

## Product Overview

Amplitude offers an integrated suite of products centered around analytics, experimentation, customer data management, and user engagement. The platform enables teams to track user interactions, analyze behavioral patterns, run A/B tests, manage customer data pipelines, and deliver personalized experiences across web and mobile applications.

### Core Product Components

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, providing event tracking, user segmentation, and behavioral analysis through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Personas, Stickiness, Revenue LTV, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Data Tables, and Compass. These charts enable teams to understand user behavior patterns, conversion funnels, retention metrics, and revenue attribution.

**Amplitude Experiment** is the feature flagging and A/B testing platform that supports both server-side and client-side experimentation. It includes advanced statistical analysis, experiment theory implementation, and sophisticated targeting capabilities. The platform provides both traditional A/B testing and advanced techniques for complex experimental designs.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and replays user sessions to provide qualitative insights into user behavior, complementing the quantitative analytics data.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user engagement through targeted messaging, onboarding flows, and feedback collection.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation across the entire customer data ecosystem, including source and destination catalogs for third-party integrations.

**Web Experimentation** provides client-side A/B testing capabilities with a visual editor for no-code experiment creation.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The platform follows a hub-and-spoke architecture where Analytics serves as the central data repository, with other products leveraging this foundation:

**Data Flow**: Events flow from various sources (SDKs, APIs, third-party integrations) into the Analytics core, where they're processed and made available to other products. Experiment exposure data feeds back into Analytics for analysis, while CDP manages the broader data ecosystem.

**Shared Infrastructure**: All products share common user identification, segmentation capabilities, and administrative functions. User properties and behavioral data from Analytics inform targeting in Experiment and Guides and Surveys.

**Cross-Product Integration**: Experiment results are analyzed using Analytics charts, Session Replay provides context for Analytics insights, and CDP ensures data consistency across all touchpoints.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events**: Discrete user actions tracked within applications (page views, clicks, purchases, etc.)

**Properties**: Attributes associated with events (event properties) or users (user properties) that provide context and enable segmentation

**Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments based on behavioral criteria or properties

**Funnels**: Sequential event flows that measure conversion rates through defined user journeys

**Retention**: Measurement of user return behavior over specified time periods

**Amplitude ID**: Unique user identifier that persists across sessions and devices

**Device ID**: Anonymous identifier for tracking users before authentication

**Flag Keys**: Unique identifiers for feature flags and experiments

**Variants**: Different versions of features or experiences being tested

**Bucketing**: Algorithm for assigning users to experiment variants

**Impressions**: Events fired when users are exposed to experiments or feature flags

**Sources**: Data input mechanisms (SDKs, APIs, integrations) that send events to Amplitude

**Destinations**: External platforms that receive processed data from Amplitude

**Taxonomies**: Organizational structures for categorizing integrations and content

## Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates extensively with the broader technology ecosystem through multiple mechanisms:

**SDK Coverage**: Comprehensive SDKs for all major platforms including Browser (JavaScript), iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal, Node.js, Python, Java, and Go, enabling event tracking across web, mobile, and server environments.

**API Access**: RESTful APIs for Analytics, Experiment, and Guides and Surveys enable programmatic access to platform functionality and data.

**Third-Party Integrations**: Extensive source and destination catalogs support data flow to/from platforms like Segment, Salesforce, Braze, Mixpanel, and hundreds of other tools.

**Ampli**: Code generation tool that creates type-safe tracking libraries based on defined tracking plans, ensuring implementation consistency across teams and platforms.

**Partner Ecosystem**: Formal partnerships with technology vendors, agencies, and consultants extend platform capabilities and provide implementation support.

## Technical Implementation

**Route Structure**: The platform uses hierarchical URL routing with clear product separation:
- `/analytics/` for core analytics features
- `/feature-experiment/` for experimentation functionality  
- `/data/` for CDP and data management
- `/sdks/` for SDK documentation and implementation
- `/apis/` for API references
- `/admin/` for administrative functions

**Multi-Site Support**: Platform supports multiple locales (English and Japanese) with content propagation controls and localized navigation structures.

**Content Management**: Uses a collection-based content architecture with taxonomies for organization, preview capabilities, and injection of navigation metadata.

**Administrative Features**: Comprehensive admin functionality covering account management, billing and usage monitoring, single sign-on configuration, and user access controls.

The platform emphasizes developer experience through extensive documentation, troubleshooting guides, migration assistance, and getting started resources that help teams implement and optimize their analytics and experimentation programs effectively.
