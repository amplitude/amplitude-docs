## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event** - A discrete user action or system occurrence tracked in Amplitude (e.g., button click, page view)
- **User/Device ID** - Unique identifier for tracking individual users across sessions
- **Session** - A period of continuous user activity, typically ending after a period of inactivity
- **Funnel** - A sequence of events representing a conversion path or user journey
- **Retention** - Measurement of users returning to the product over time periods
- **Segmentation** - Breaking down metrics by user properties or behaviors
- **Cohort** - A group of users who share common characteristics or behaviors
- **Experiment** - A controlled test comparing different variations of a feature
- **Feature Flag** - A toggle that enables/disables features for specific users
- **SDK (Software Development Kit)** - Client libraries for implementing Amplitude in applications
- **Ampli** - Code generation tool that creates type-safe wrappers for analytics implementation
- **Source** - Integration point for importing data into Amplitude
- **Destination** - Integration point for exporting data from Amplitude
- **CDP (Customer Data Platform)** - System for unifying customer data across sources
- **PII (Personally Identifiable Information)** - Sensitive user data requiring special handling

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude platform functions as an integrated ecosystem with data flowing between components:

1. **Data Collection Layer**:
   - SDKs capture events from various client platforms
   - Sources bring in data from external systems and tools
   - APIs enable programmatic data ingestion
   - Session Replay captures visual user interactions

2. **Data Processing Layer**:
   - Events are processed, enriched, and stored
   - User profiles are maintained and updated
   - Data is prepared for analysis and segmentation
   - PII is handled according to privacy requirements

3. **Analysis Layer**:
   - Charts and visualizations provide insights into user behavior
   - Session Replay offers visual context for quantitative data
   - Experiment results measure impact of different variations
   - Behavioral cohorts identify user segments

4. **Action Layer**:
   - Audiences segment users for targeting
   - Destinations export data to marketing and operational systems
   - Experiments implement variations based on insights
   - Feature flags control feature availability

This integrated approach supports a continuous improvement cycle where:
- Data collection provides insights through analytics
- Insights drive hypotheses for experimentation
- Experiments validate or invalidate hypotheses
- Successful variations are implemented for all users
- The cycle repeats with new data collection

## API Endpoints and Implementation

### Analytics API
```
POST https://api.amplitude.com/2/httpapi
```
Used for sending events to Amplitude programmatically.

### Identify API
```
POST https://api.amplitude.com/identify
```
Used for updating user properties without logging events.

### Experiment API
```
GET https://experiment.amplitude.com/api/1/flags/{project_id}
```
Retrieves feature flag configurations for a project.

```
POST https://experiment.amplitude.com/api/1/exposures
```
Logs exposure events when users encounter experiment variations.

### SDK Implementation Examples

**Browser SDK:**
```javascript
import * as amplitude from '@amplitude/analytics-browser';
amplitude.init('API_KEY');
amplitude.track('Event Name', { property: 'value' });
```

**iOS SDK:**
```swift
let amplitude = Amplitude(configuration: Configuration(apiKey: "API_KEY"))
amplitude.track(event: BaseEvent(eventType: "Event Name"))
```

**Android SDK:**
```kotlin
val amplitude = Amplitude(Configuration(apiKey = "API_KEY", context = applicationContext))
amplitude.track(BaseEvent(eventType = "Event Name"))
```

**Experiment SDK:**
```javascript
import { Experiment } from '@amplitude/experiment-js-client';
const experiment = Experiment.initialize('API_KEY');
const variant = await experiment.fetch('user-id');
const flagValue = experiment.evaluate('flag-key', 'default-value');
```

**Ampli Implementation:**
```javascript
// After generating Ampli wrapper
import { ampli } from './ampli';
ampli.init();
ampli.trackEventWithProperties('user-id', { property: 'value' });
```

The Amplitude platform is designed with modularity in mind, allowing customers to implement only the components they need while maintaining the ability to expand to additional functionality as their analytics needs grow.
