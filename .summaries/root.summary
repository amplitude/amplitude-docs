Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive data-driven decision making across web and mobile applications.

## High-Level Product Overview

Amplitude's platform consists of four core products: **Analytics** for behavioral analysis and user insights, **Experiment** for A/B testing and feature flagging, **Session Replay** for user experience optimization, and **Guides and Surveys** for in-product user engagement. The platform is supported by a robust **Customer Data Platform (CDP)** that manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation across the entire ecosystem.

The platform serves multiple user personas from product managers analyzing user funnels to engineers implementing tracking SDKs, with specialized tools for data scientists, marketers, and administrators managing organizational settings and compliance requirements.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

### Analytics Core
The Analytics product centers around **Charts** - specialized visualization tools for different analytical use cases. Key chart types include:
- **Event Segmentation** for analyzing user actions and properties
- **Funnel Analysis** for conversion optimization
- **Retention Analysis** for user engagement measurement  
- **User Sessions** and **Journeys** for behavioral flow analysis
- **Revenue LTV** for monetization insights
- **Personas** for user segmentation
- **Compass** for metric monitoring and alerting

### Experimentation Suite
**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with sophisticated statistical analysis. The product includes **Experiment Results** charts for analyzing test performance, **Advanced Techniques** for complex experimental designs, and **Experiment Theory** for statistical methodology guidance.

### Data Infrastructure
The **CDP (Customer Data Platform)** manages the entire data lifecycle through:
- **Sources** for data ingestion from various platforms
- **Destinations** for data activation and export
- **Audiences** for user segmentation and targeting
- **Warehouse-native Amplitude** for direct data warehouse integration

### Implementation Tools
**SDKs** provide instrumentation across platforms (Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal, Node.js, Python, Java, Go), while **Ampli** generates type-safe tracking libraries from centralized data schemas. **APIs** enable programmatic access to analytics data, experiment configuration, and platform management.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Core Analytics Concepts
- **Events**: User actions tracked within applications (page views, clicks, purchases)
- **Properties**: Attributes associated with events (event properties) or users (user properties)
- **Segments**: Filtered subsets of users or events based on specific criteria
- **Cohorts**: Groups of users defined by shared characteristics or behaviors
- **Funnels**: Sequential steps in user workflows used to measure conversion rates
- **Retention**: Measurement of user return behavior over time periods

### Experimentation Terminology
- **Feature Flags**: Boolean toggles controlling feature availability
- **Variants**: Different versions of features being tested in experiments
- **Allocation**: Percentage of users exposed to each experiment variant
- **Statistical Significance**: Confidence level in experiment results
- **Lift**: Percentage improvement of treatment over control groups

### Data Management
- **Tracking Plan**: Centralized schema defining events and properties
- **Taxonomy**: Standardized naming conventions for consistent data collection
- **Data Validation**: Automated checks ensuring data quality and schema compliance
- **Real-time vs Historical**: Distinction between live data streams and processed historical datasets

### Identity Resolution
- **User ID**: Persistent identifier for authenticated users across sessions
- **Device ID**: Anonymous identifier for tracking before authentication
- **Amplitude ID**: Internal identifier merging user and device identities
- **Group Properties**: Attributes associated with organizational entities (companies, teams)

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude operates as a central hub in the modern data stack, integrating with hundreds of tools through its **Source Catalog** and **Destination Catalog**. The platform connects with:

**Data Sources**: Customer data platforms (Segment, mParticle), marketing tools (Google Analytics, Facebook), product analytics tools, and custom applications via SDKs and APIs.

**Data Destinations**: Business intelligence tools (Tableau, Looker), marketing automation platforms (Braze, Iterable), data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery), and customer success platforms.

**Development Workflow**: Integration with CI/CD pipelines through the Ampli CLI, version control systems for tracking plan management, and development frameworks through comprehensive SDK support.

### Administrative and Compliance Features
**Account Management** handles user permissions, organizational structure, and access controls. **Single Sign-On** provides enterprise authentication integration. **Billing and Use** manages subscription limits and usage monitoring. **PII Integrations** ensure privacy compliance and data governance.

### API Endpoints and CLI Commands

Key API endpoints include:
- `/analytics/events` for event data querying
- `/experiment/flags` for feature flag management  
- `/cohorts` for audience management
- `/taxonomy` for tracking plan operations

Primary CLI commands:
- `ampli pull` - Download tracking plan schemas
- `ampli status` - Validate implementation against schemas
- `ampli codegen` - Generate type-safe tracking code

The platform supports both REST APIs for standard operations and GraphQL endpoints for complex data queries, with comprehensive SDKs abstracting API complexity for common use cases.

### Migration and Troubleshooting Support
Dedicated **Migration** resources facilitate transitions from other analytics platforms, while **FAQ and Troubleshooting** sections provide comprehensive support for implementation challenges. **Experiment Troubleshooting** specifically addresses statistical analysis and experimental design questions.

The ecosystem emphasizes developer experience through extensive documentation, code examples, and integration guides, while maintaining enterprise-grade security, compliance, and scalability features for large-scale deployments.
