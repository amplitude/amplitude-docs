Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven decision making. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP), all unified through a common data foundation and extensive SDK ecosystem.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The platform operates through a multi-layered architecture centered around **Analytics** as the core product, with specialized modules extending functionality:

**Analytics Core** provides the foundational data collection, processing, and visualization capabilities through an extensive **Charts** ecosystem. The charting system includes 15+ specialized analysis types: Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Personas, Stickiness, Compass, Data Tables, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, Revenue LTV, and Experiment Results. Each chart type serves specific analytical use cases while sharing common data infrastructure and user interface patterns.

**Amplitude Experiment** operates as a comprehensive A/B testing and feature flag platform with both client-side and server-side evaluation capabilities. It integrates deeply with Analytics for user identification, targeting, and results analysis, while maintaining independence for organizations using third-party feature flagging systems.

**Session Replay** captures and reconstructs user interactions for qualitative analysis, complementing quantitative analytics with visual behavior insights.

**Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user engagement through targeted messaging and feedback collection, with dedicated API endpoints for programmatic control.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation through extensive **Source** and **Destination Catalogs** with 100+ integrations, **Audiences** for user segmentation, and **Warehouse-native** capabilities for direct data warehouse analysis.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Instrumentation**: The foundational process of implementing event tracking through SDKs, encompassing event schema design, user identification, and data quality management across web, mobile, and server-side applications.

**Events and Properties**: Core data model where events represent user actions and properties provide contextual attributes. Events flow through the platform to power all analytical and experimental capabilities.

**User Identification System**: Multi-layered approach using user_id (authenticated users), device_id (anonymous tracking), and Amplitude ID (unified identity) to maintain consistent user profiles across sessions and devices.

**Cohorts and Audiences**: User segmentation mechanisms where cohorts represent behavioral groupings within Analytics and audiences extend segmentation capabilities for activation and targeting across the platform ecosystem.

**Deployments**: Configuration containers in Experiment that define evaluation environments, access controls, and SDK behavior for feature flags and A/B tests.

**Bucketing and Evaluation**: Experiment assignment mechanisms supporting both remote evaluation (server-side) and local evaluation (client-side) with sophisticated targeting, traffic allocation, and statistical controls.

**Mount Points**: Technical infrastructure enabling content organization and URL routing across documentation collections, indicating a sophisticated content management system underlying the platform.

**Taxonomies**: Classification systems (particularly integration_category) used to organize the extensive catalog of data sources and destinations within the CDP ecosystem.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The platform demonstrates deep integration across its component products through shared infrastructure and data flows:

**Unified Data Foundation**: All products leverage common event tracking, user identification, and data processing infrastructure. Analytics SDKs (Android, iOS, Browser, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, Unreal) serve as data collection endpoints for the entire ecosystem.

**Cross-Product Data Flow**: Experiment results feed into Analytics charts, Session Replay events integrate with behavioral analysis, Guides and Surveys responses become analytical events, and CDP audiences power targeting across Experiment and Guides.

**API Ecosystem**: Comprehensive API coverage includes Analytics API, Experiment APIs, and Guides and Surveys API, enabling programmatic access and custom integrations across the platform.

**Enterprise Administration**: Centralized management through Account Management, Billing and Use monitoring, Single Sign-on integration, and administrative controls that span all product modules.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Analytics APIs**: Event ingestion endpoints (`/apis/analytics/`) supporting batch and real-time data submission, with extensive SDK support across programming languages and platforms.

**Experiment APIs**: Feature flag evaluation endpoints (`/apis/experiment/`) providing both REST API access and SDK-based integration for variant assignment and exposure tracking.

**Guides and Surveys API**: In-product messaging control (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) enabling programmatic survey deployment and response collection.

**SDK Architecture**: Platform-specific implementations across mobile (iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal), web (Browser), and server-side (Node.js, Python, Java, Go) environments, with **Ampli** providing type-safe, code-generated SDK wrappers for enhanced developer experience.

**Data Integration**: Extensive source catalog supporting data ingestion from marketing platforms, databases, cloud services, and custom applications, paired with destination catalog enabling data activation across advertising, analytics, and business intelligence platforms.

**Advanced Capabilities**: The platform supports sophisticated use cases including PII management and compliance, partner integrations, warehouse-native analysis for organizations preferring data warehouse-centric workflows, and comprehensive migration tooling for platform transitions.

The architecture demonstrates enterprise-scale capabilities with multi-site support (English and Japanese localization), extensive troubleshooting and FAQ resources, and academy content for user education, indicating a mature platform designed for global deployment across diverse organizational contexts and technical requirements.
