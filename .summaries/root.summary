# Amplitude Product Suite

## Product Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive analytics and experimentation platform designed to help organizations understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of five core products that work together to provide a complete solution for product analytics, experimentation, and user engagement.

## Product Relationships and Ecosystem

The Amplitude Product Suite follows a logical workflow that enables organizations to collect data, derive insights, test hypotheses, validate findings, and engage users:

1. **Amplitude Data** forms the foundation of the ecosystem, handling data collection, governance, and quality management.
2. **Amplitude Analytics** builds on this data layer to provide visualization tools and insights into user behavior.
3. **Amplitude Experiment** leverages these insights to test hypotheses through A/B testing and feature flagging.
4. **Session Replay** adds qualitative context to quantitative data through visual recordings of user sessions.
5. **Guides and Surveys** closes the loop by enabling direct user engagement based on insights.

This integrated approach creates a seamless workflow from data collection to action, allowing teams to make informed product decisions based on user behavior data.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Events**: User actions tracked in Amplitude (page views, button clicks, etc.)
- **Event Properties**: Contextual metadata associated with events
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes associated with users across sessions
- **Cohorts**: Groups of users sharing common behaviors or attributes
- **Amplitude ID**: Internal identifier linking Device IDs and User IDs
- **Variant**: A specific version in an experiment
- **Feature Flag**: Toggle enabling/disabling features for specific users
- **Tracking Plan**: Schema defining events and properties to be collected
- **Bucketing**: Process of assigning users to experiment variants
- **Exposure Event**: Analytics event recording when a user sees an experiment variant
- **Property Groups**: Collections of related properties for organizational purposes
- **Derived Properties**: Calculated properties based on existing event or user properties
- **Lookup Tables**: Reference data that can be joined with events for enrichment

## Detailed Product Descriptions

### Amplitude Data

Amplitude Data serves as the data management layer with tools for:
- Data collection via SDKs and APIs
- Data governance through tracking plans and schema management
- Data quality validation and transformations
- Identity resolution across devices and sessions
- Integration with data warehouses (Warehouse-native Amplitude)

Key features include:
- **Tracking Plans**: Define and manage event schemas
- **Ampli Developer Toolkit**: Generate type-safe tracking code
- **Property Groups**: Organize related properties
- **Transformations**: Modify data post-collection
- **Custom Events**: Create events derived from existing ones
- **Derived Properties**: Calculate new properties from existing data
- **Lookup Tables**: Join reference data with events

### Amplitude Analytics

Amplitude Analytics provides behavioral analytics capabilities with visualization tools including:
- **Event Segmentation**: Analyze specific user actions
- **Funnel Analysis**: Track conversion through multi-step processes
- **Retention Analysis**: Measure user return rates
- **Pathfinder/Journey**: Visualize user navigation paths
- **Lifecycle**: Track new, returning, and churned users
- **Stickiness**: Measure frequency of product use
- **Revenue LTV**: Analyze lifetime value metrics
- **Compass**: Discover correlations between behaviors
- **Personas**: Create user segments based on behavior
- **Impact Analysis**: Measure feature impact on key metrics

Collaboration features include Dashboards, Notebooks, Templates, and Breadcrumbs for sharing insights.

### Amplitude Experiment

Amplitude Experiment enables teams to test hypotheses through:
- A/B testing with statistical rigor
- Feature flag management
- Progressive feature delivery
- Local and remote evaluation modes
- Holdout groups and mutual exclusion groups
- Integration with analytics for results analysis

The platform supports both client-side and server-side implementations with SDKs for various programming languages.

### Session Replay

This qualitative analytics tool records and plays back user sessions, offering:
- Video-like replays of user interactions
- Heatmaps (click maps, selector maps, scroll maps)
- Privacy controls with multiple masking levels
- Cross-platform support (web, iOS, Android, React Native)

### Guides and Surveys

An in-product messaging and feedback collection solution featuring:
- Various templates (Tours, Announcements, Checklists, Banners, Tooltips)
- Multiple form factors (Modal, Popover, Pin, Tooltip, Banner)
- Audience segmentation and targeting
- Survey capabilities (NPS, User Feedback, Rating)

## Implementation Methods

### SDKs
Amplitude provides SDKs for various platforms:
- **Browser/JavaScript**: For web applications
- **iOS/Android**: For mobile applications
- **Server-side**: Node.js, Python, Java, Go, etc.
- **Game engines**: Unity, Unreal
- **Cross-platform**: React Native, Flutter

### APIs
- **HTTP V2 API**: Primary endpoint for sending events
- **Identify API**: Updates user properties without sending events
- **Batch API**: Sends multiple events in a single request
- **Export API**: Retrieves raw event data
- **Experiment APIs**: Manages and evaluates experiments

### Ampli
The Ampli CLI and wrapper provide type-safe tracking implementation based on tracking plans defined in Amplitude Data, ensuring data quality and consistency across implementations.
