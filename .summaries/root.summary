Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to track, analyze, and optimize user behavior across web and mobile applications. The platform consists of multiple integrated products including Analytics, Experiment (A/B testing), Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP), all supported by extensive SDK libraries and API infrastructure.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The platform operates on a hierarchical organizational model where **Organizations** contain multiple **Projects**, each representing distinct applications or data sources. This structure enables cross-project analysis through the **Portfolio** feature, which creates unified **Views** that merge up to 5-10 projects for comprehensive behavioral analysis using user ID/device ID matching and the User Mapping API for identity resolution.

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the core foundation, providing behavioral event tracking through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Stickiness, Lifecycle, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, Revenue LTV, and Experiment Results. These charts integrate with advanced features like **Microscope** for deep-dive analysis and **Behavioral Cohorts** for user segmentation.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced statistical analysis, including sequential testing, CUPED variance reduction, and multi-armed bandit optimization. The experiment platform integrates directly with analytics charts for results analysis and supports both client-side and server-side implementations.

**Session Replay** captures and reconstructs user interactions through diff-based recording, providing visual insights through heatmaps and session playback while maintaining strict privacy controls. **Guides and Surveys** enables in-app messaging and user feedback collection with targeting based on behavioral data.

The **Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation through Sources and Destinations, with support for real-time streaming, batch processing, and data governance controls.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**SDKs and Implementation**: The platform provides extensive SDK support across platforms including Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal, Node.js, Python, Java, and Go. **Ampli** serves as a type-safe wrapper that generates strongly-typed tracking libraries from a centralized tracking plan.

**Data Management**: **Events** represent user actions, while **Properties** provide contextual data. **User Properties** persist across sessions, and **Group Properties** enable account-level analysis. **Derived Properties** allow computed fields, while **Governing Properties** enforce data consistency.

**Experimentation Terms**: **Feature Flags** control feature rollouts, **Experiments** test variations with statistical analysis, **Variants** represent different user experiences, and **Exposure Events** track when users encounter experiments. **Local Evaluation** enables client-side flag resolution, while **Remote Evaluation** uses server-side determination.

**Analytics Concepts**: **Cohorts** define user segments, **Funnels** track conversion paths, **Retention** measures user return behavior, **Stickiness** analyzes engagement frequency, and **Lifecycle** categorizes users by activity patterns. **Personas** create behavioral user profiles based on event patterns.

**Privacy and Compliance**: **Masking Levels** (Conservative, Light, Medium) control data obfuscation in Session Replay, **GDPR Deletion** enables data subject rights compliance, and **SCIM Provisioning** supports enterprise identity management.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The platform integrates with numerous third-party systems through its **Source Catalog** (data ingestion) and **Destination Catalog** (data activation). Sources include analytics platforms, databases, and SaaS applications, while destinations encompass advertising platforms, marketing automation tools, and data warehouses.

**Identity Resolution** connects user behavior across devices and platforms through User ID mapping and device ID stitching. **Cross-Project Analysis** enables portfolio-level insights across multiple applications or business units.

The **Warehouse-Native** approach allows organizations to run Amplitude analytics directly on their data warehouse infrastructure, supporting Snowflake, BigQuery, and Databricks deployments.

**Partner Integrations** extend functionality through certified integrations with platforms like Segment, Rudderstack, mParticle, and various marketing and product tools.
