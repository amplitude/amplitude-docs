# Amplitude Product Documentation

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and data activation platform designed to help businesses understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-informed decisions. The platform offers a suite of integrated products including Analytics, Experiment, CDP (Customer Data Platform), SDKs, APIs, and a Destination Catalog.

The platform provides various visualization tools such as charts, funnels, user journeys, cohort analysis, and impact measurement capabilities that enable teams to gain insights into user behavior and make data-driven decisions. Amplitude's core value proposition is connecting user behavior data to actionable insights that can drive product improvements and business growth.

## Product Relationships and Features

Amplitude's ecosystem consists of several interconnected layers:

1. **Data Collection Layer**
   - Multiple SDK options across platforms (Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal, Node.js, Python, Java, Go)

   - Flexible server-side and client-side tracking capabilities

2. **Data Processing Layer**
   - Source Catalog for data ingestion from various platforms
   - PII management features for data privacy compliance
   - Structured data tables for analysis

3. **Analytics Layer**
   - Diverse chart types (Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention, User Sessions)
   - Compass for guided analytics workflows
   - Personas for user segmentation
   - Engagement Matrix for behavioral pattern analysis

4. **Activation Layer**
   - Destination Catalog with over 100 integration options
   - Cohort syncing capabilities
   - Event streaming functionality
   - User Profile API for personalization use cases

5. **Experimentation Layer**
   - Web experiment capabilities
   - SDK-based experiment implementation
   - Impact analysis tools
   - Experiment results visualization

6. **Administration Layer**
   - Account management features
   - Billing and usage monitoring
   - Single Sign-On implementation
   - Granular user permissions

These components work together to create a complete workflow from data collection to insight generation and action.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: A discrete user action or system occurrence tracked in Amplitude
- **User**: An individual interacting with a product, identified by a unique ID
- **Cohort**: A group of users defined by specific behaviors or characteristics
- **Session**: A period of continuous user engagement with a product
- **Funnel**: A sequence of events representing a user journey or conversion path
- **Retention**: Measurement of how users return to a product over time
- **Property**: Metadata attached to events or users providing additional context
- **Segment**: A subset of data filtered by specific criteria
- **Chart**: Visualization of analytics data in various formats
- **SDK**: Libraries for instrumenting applications to collect data
- **Source**: Platform or service from which data is collected
- **Destination**: Third-party platform receiving data from Amplitude
- **Experiment**: A controlled test comparing variations of a feature
- **Variant**: A specific version of a feature being tested in an experiment
- **Impact Analysis**: Measurement of experiment effects on key metrics

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's platform components integrate in a cohesive workflow:

1. Applications instrumented with Amplitude SDKs send event data to the platform
2. The system processes, enriches, and stores events for analysis
3. Users explore data through various visualization tools and analytics features
4. Analysts create cohorts based on identified behavior patterns
5. These cohorts and events can be sent to external destinations for targeted actions
6. Product teams can test features with controlled experiments
7. The impact of changes is measured through analytics tools

Cross-product workflows enable powerful use cases:
- Creating user segments in Analytics and activating them through the Destination Catalog
- Running experiments and measuring their results in Analytics charts
- Using CDP data to enrich analytics and power personalization initiatives

## API Endpoints and Integration Points

Amplitude provides several API endpoints for programmatic integration:

- **Analytics API**: `https://amplitude.com/api/2/events` - For sending events
- **User Profile API**: `https://profile-api.amplitude.com/v1/userprofile` - For retrieving user profiles
- **Cohort API**: `https://amplitude.com/api/2/cohorts/export` - For exporting cohorts
- **Export API**: `https://amplitude.com/api/2/export` - For exporting raw event data
- **Experiment API**: `https://api.lab.amplitude.com/v1/vardata` - For experiment variant assignment

SDK initialization examples:

```javascript
// Browser SDK initialization
amplitude.init('API_KEY', {
  serverUrl: 'https://api.amplitude.com',
  logLevel: 3,
  includeUtm: true,
  includeReferrer: true
});

// Tracking an event
amplitude.track('Button Clicked', {
  buttonColor: 'blue',
  buttonText: 'Sign Up'
});
```

```python
# Python SDK initialization
from amplitude import Amplitude

amplitude = Amplitude('API_KEY')
amplitude.track(
    event_type='Button Clicked',
    user_id='user123',
    event_properties={
        'buttonColor': 'blue',
        'buttonText': 'Sign Up'
    }
)
```

These integration points allow developers to incorporate Amplitude's functionality directly into their applications and workflows, enabling seamless data collection and activation.
