# Amplitude Product Suite Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive business growth through data-driven insights. The platform collects, analyzes, and enables action on user interaction data across digital products.

## Key Features and Concepts

Amplitude's platform provides tools for behavioral analytics, user segmentation, experimentation, and data management. The core value proposition is helping product teams understand how users interact with digital products, identify opportunities for improvement, and measure the impact of product changes.

Key use cases include:
- Analyzing user conversion and retention
- Understanding user journeys and navigation patterns
- Segmenting users based on behavior
- Running A/B tests and experiments
- Ensuring data quality and governance

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Amplitude product suite consists of several interconnected components:

1. **Analytics and Visualization**
   - **Charts**: Visualization tools including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, and specialized charts (Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, Compass)
   - **Journeys**: Path analysis tools (Pathfinder and Journey Map) for visualizing user navigation flows
   - **Data Tables**: Multi-dimensional analysis for comparing metrics across dimensions, with marketing attribution capabilities

2. **Data Management**
   - **Data**: Governance platform for defining, tracking, validating, and transforming analytics data
   - **Ampli**: Type-safe SDK wrappers generated from tracking plans to reduce implementation errors
   - **Session Replay**: Visual playback and analysis of user sessions

3. **Experimentation**
   - **Experiment**: Platform for A/B testing with statistical analysis using Welch's T-test methodology
   - Includes experiment design tools like Duration Estimator
   - Supports both A/B Testing and Multi-Armed Bandit experiments

4. **User Segmentation and Management**
   - **Audiences**: Tools for creating and analyzing behavioral cohorts
   - **Personas**: Clustering of users with similar behaviors
   - **User Profile API**: Access to user properties and recommendations

5. **APIs and Integration**
   - Event Ingestion APIs (HTTP V2, Batch Upload)
   - Data Retrieval APIs (Dashboard REST, Export)
   - Data Management APIs (Taxonomy, Lookup Table)
   - Privacy and Compliance APIs (User Privacy, CCPA DSAR)

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Data Structure
- **Events**: User actions tracked in Amplitude (limited to 2000 event types per project)
- **Properties**:
  - **Event Properties**: Contextual attributes attached to specific events
  - **User Properties**: Persistent attributes of users that span across events
  - **Group Properties**: Attributes of organizational groups

### Identity Management
- **User ID**: Custom identifier for authenticated users
- **Device ID**: Identifier for devices (uses IDFV on iOS by default)
- **Amplitude ID**: Internal user identifier used by Amplitude

### Analysis Concepts
- **Sessions**: Series of user events grouped by time proximity (default 30-minute timeout)
- **Cohorts**: Groups of users defined by behavioral criteria
- **Attribution Models**: Methods for distributing credit across marketing touchpoints
- **Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE)**: Smallest meaningful change an experiment aims to detect

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's platform operates as an integrated ecosystem with data flowing through several layers:

1. **Data Collection Layer**:
   - SDKs for various platforms capture user interactions
   - HTTP APIs enable real-time and batch data ingestion
   - Third-party integrations (like Segment) provide additional data sources

2. **Data Management Layer**:
   - Tracking Plans define the structure of events and properties
   - Data validation ensures quality and consistency
   - Transformations allow for retroactive data modifications

3. **Analytics Layer**:
   - Visualization tools provide insights into user behavior
   - Segmentation identifies distinct user groups
   - Journey mapping reveals user navigation patterns

4. **Experimentation Layer**:
   - Experiment design and targeting capabilities
   - Statistical analysis of test results
   - Feature flagging for controlled rollouts

5. **Integration Layer**:
   - Event streaming to external tools
   - Cohort synchronization with marketing platforms
   - Data warehouse connections for broader analytics

## Technical Implementation

### API Endpoints
- Event Ingestion: `https://api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`
- Batch Upload: `https://api2.amplitude.com/batch`
- Export API: `https://amplitude.com/api/2/export`
- Dashboard REST API: `https://amplitude.com/api/2/events/segmentation`

### SDK Implementation Example
```javascript
// JavaScript SDK initialization
amplitude.getInstance().init("API_KEY", null, {
  flushIntervalMillis: 1000,
  eventUploadThreshold: 30
});

// Tracking an event
amplitude.getInstance().logEvent("Event Name", {
  property1: "value1",
  property2: "value2"
});
```

### Ampli CLI Commands
- `ampli pull`: Pull tracking plan changes
- `ampli status`: Check status of local tracking plan

Amplitude offers various subscription tiers including Free, Plus, Growth, and Enterprise plans, with advanced features like Behavioral Cohorts, Pathfinder, and Data Tables available in higher tiers.
