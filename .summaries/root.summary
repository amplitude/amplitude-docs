Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize digital experiences, and make data-driven decisions through behavioral analysis, A/B testing, and user session reconstruction.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem centers on four interconnected core products built upon a unified data foundation:

**Analytics** serves as the primary behavioral analytics engine, processing user events and properties to generate insights about user journeys and product performance. **Data** handles integration with existing technology stacks and data warehouses, enabling bidirectional data flow between Amplitude and other business systems. **Experiment** leverages the analytics foundation to execute sophisticated A/B tests and manage feature flags, while **Session Replay** provides visual context to quantitative insights by reconstructing actual user interactions.

The platform supports both client-side and server-side implementations through comprehensive SDKs, with all products sharing common data models for users, events, and properties to ensure consistency across the ecosystem. The JavaScript SDK handles browser-based tracking with integrated session replay capabilities, while native mobile SDKs provide platform-specific analytics functionality.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Data Concepts:**
- **Events**: Discrete user actions tracked within applications (clicks, page views, purchases, custom interactions)
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes describing users across sessions (demographics, subscription status, account type)
- **Event Properties**: Contextual metadata specific to individual events (product category, page URL, transaction value)
- **user_id**: Persistent identifier for authenticated users that maintains continuity across sessions and devices
- **device_id**: Anonymous identifier for tracking users before authentication or for privacy-compliant scenarios

**Experimentation Framework:**
- **Feature Flags**: Configuration switches that dynamically control feature availability and behavior without code deployments
- **Treatment Variants**: Different versions of features or experiences being tested within experiments
- **Control Groups**: Baseline comparison groups that receive the standard experience
- **Sequential Testing**: Advanced statistical methodology using mixture sequential probability ratio test (mSPRT) for continuous experiment monitoring
- **Conversion Rate Testing**: Experiments specifically designed to measure binary outcome metrics

**Technical Infrastructure:**
- **Session Replay Browser Package** (@amplitude/session-replay-browser): Client-side JavaScript library for recording and reconstructing user interactions
- **Remote Configuration** (fetchRemoteConfig): API-driven system for retrieving dynamic feature flag and experiment configurations
- **Autocapture**: Automated tracking system that captures user interactions without manual event instrumentation

## Platform Integration and Ecosystem

Amplitude integrates into broader organizational ecosystems through multiple integration layers. The Data product facilitates warehouse-native architectures, enabling organizations to combine Amplitude behavioral insights with existing business intelligence, customer data platforms, and operational systems. This creates a unified view of customer behavior across all touchpoints.

The platform employs a CDN-based architecture (cdn.amplitude.com) for SDK distribution and real-time configuration management, supporting dynamic feature flag updates and experiment configuration changes without requiring application redeployments. This infrastructure enables rapid iteration and testing cycles while maintaining system reliability.

SDKs accommodate various development frameworks and deployment strategies, from single-page applications to complex multi-platform ecosystems, ensuring consistent data collection and user experience optimization across all digital touchpoints.

## Technical Implementation

**SDK Initialization and Configuration:**
- **JavaScript**: `amplitude.init()` with API key configuration, optional autocapture settings, and session replay integration
- **Swift**: `amplitudeEngagement.boot()` using AmplitudeBootOptions for user identification and device configuration
- **Remote Configuration**: Dynamic retrieval of feature flags and experiment assignments through `fetchRemoteConfig` API calls

**Advanced Statistical Methodology:**
The Experiment product implements sophisticated statistical techniques, particularly mSPRT for sequential testing, which provides significant advantages over traditional fixed-horizon T-tests. This methodology enables continuous monitoring of experiment results while maintaining statistical rigor and controlling for Type I and Type II errors. The system handles both binary metrics (conversion rates, feature adoption) and continuous metrics (revenue, engagement time), with built-in outlier detection and Central Limit Theorem applications for robust statistical inference.

**Data Architecture and User Identity:**
The platform maintains a sophisticated user identity resolution system that seamlessly transitions between anonymous (device_id) and authenticated (user_id) user states. This dual-identifier approach enables comprehensive user journey tracking from initial anonymous interactions through authentication and across multiple sessions and devices.

Property hierarchies distinguish between persistent user attributes and contextual event data, enabling sophisticated behavioral segmentation and cohort analysis while maintaining data integrity throughout the customer lifecycle. This structure supports advanced use cases including cross-platform user journey analysis, retention cohort studies, and predictive behavioral modeling.
