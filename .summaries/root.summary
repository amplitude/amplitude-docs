Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with integrated tools for data collection, behavioral analysis, feature experimentation, and user engagement optimization across the entire product development lifecycle.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of four primary products that work synergistically:

**Amplitude Analytics** forms the analytical foundation, offering event-based user behavior tracking through sophisticated chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, Cohort Analysis, and User Journey mapping. The analytics engine provides real-time data processing with automated insights through Compass, behavioral segmentation via Personas, and Revenue LTV analysis for monetization optimization.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with both remote and local evaluation methods. The experimentation platform includes advanced statistical analysis, sophisticated targeting mechanisms, and seamless integration with analytics data for comprehensive experiment lifecycle management.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and enables playback of actual user sessions, providing qualitative insights to complement quantitative analytics data for identifying usability issues and optimization opportunities.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** facilitates in-product user engagement through targeted messaging, onboarding workflows, and feedback collection systems that can be triggered based on analytical insights.

## Data Infrastructure and Customer Data Platform

The platform operates on a robust Customer Data Platform (CDP) architecture supporting multi-source data ingestion through extensive Source Catalog integrations and data activation via Destination Catalog connectors. This enables organizations to create unified customer profiles and activate insights across marketing, analytics, and operational tools.

**Warehouse-native Amplitude** allows analytics execution directly on existing data warehouse infrastructure, providing architectural flexibility while maintaining full analytical capabilities. The **Audiences** functionality enables creation and management of user segments that can be activated across various destinations for personalized experiences.

## SDK and Implementation Ecosystem

Amplitude provides comprehensive instrumentation through platform-specific SDK implementations:

**Analytics SDKs** cover web (Browser SDK), mobile platforms (Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Unity), server-side languages (Node.js, Python, Java, Go), and specialized gaming engines (Unity, Unreal Engine).

**Experiment SDKs** mirror analytics SDK coverage with specialized feature flagging functionality, supporting both client-side and server-side evaluation patterns for different architectural requirements.

**Ampli** serves as a type-safe code generation tool that ensures consistent event tracking implementation across platforms while providing compile-time validation of tracking schemas.

## API Infrastructure and Programmatic Access

The platform exposes comprehensive programmatic interfaces:

**Analytics APIs** provide event ingestion endpoints, data export capabilities, and analytical query interfaces for custom integrations and automated workflows.

**Experiment APIs** support programmatic experiment management, feature flag configuration, and evaluation services for advanced implementation scenarios.

**Guides and Surveys API** enables automated management of user engagement campaigns and feedback collection workflows.

## Analytical Capabilities and Chart Types

Amplitude Analytics offers sophisticated visualization and analysis tools:

**Event Segmentation** provides flexible event analysis with multi-dimensional breakdowns and comparative capabilities. **Funnel Analysis** tracks conversion paths with detailed drop-off analysis. **Retention Analysis** measures user return behavior through cohort-based retention curves.

**User Sessions** analyzes engagement patterns, while **Journeys** maps user navigation paths. **Lifecycle** categorizes users by engagement patterns (new, current, dormant, resurrected), and **Stickiness** measures engagement frequency and habit formation.

**Engagement Matrix** provides multi-dimensional engagement views, **Impact Analysis** quantifies feature effects on key metrics, and **Revenue LTV** analyzes customer lifetime value and revenue attribution.

**Data Tables** offer flexible data exploration with custom queries, while **Experiment Results** provide statistical analysis and visualization of A/B test outcomes.

## Enterprise and Administrative Features

**Account Management** provides organizational structure management, user provisioning, and granular access control. **Single Sign-On** supports enterprise authentication integration with SAML and identity providers. **Billing and Use** offers usage monitoring, plan management, and cost optimization tools.

The platform includes **PII Integrations** for privacy-compliant handling of personally identifiable information with appropriate governance controls, essential for regulatory compliance.

## Advanced Experimentation Capabilities

The experimentation platform includes sophisticated statistical methodologies through **Advanced Techniques** covering sample size calculations, statistical significance testing, and complex targeting mechanisms. **Experiment Theory** provides foundational statistical knowledge for proper experiment design and analysis.

**Under the Hood** documentation explains technical implementation details and architectural decisions, while **Workflow** guidance provides structured approaches to experiment design, implementation, and analysis phases.

## Ecosystem Integration and Migration

The platform supports extensive third-party integrations through a **Partners** ecosystem, enabling extended functionality and marketplace solutions. **Migration** tools facilitate transitions from other analytics platforms with data preservation and mapping capabilities.

**Legacy Charts** maintain backward compatibility while encouraging adoption of newer analytical capabilities, ensuring smooth platform evolution for existing users.

The platform demonstrates global market focus through **Japanese Translation** and localized content, indicating international compliance considerations and multi-regional deployment capabilities.
