# Amplitude Product Documentation

## Product Overview

Amplitude is a digital analytics and experimentation platform that helps businesses understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth. The platform combines analytics, data management, experimentation, session recording, and user engagement tools into an integrated ecosystem.

Key features include:
- Behavioral analytics for tracking user interactions
- Customer data unification and identity resolution
- Feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities
- Session recording for qualitative analysis
- In-app messaging and user feedback collection

The platform serves product teams, marketers, data analysts, and developers who need to understand user behavior, test hypotheses, and create personalized experiences.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

Amplitude's platform consists of five core products that work together:

1. **Analytics Platform** - The central hub for behavioral analysis, providing dashboards, charts, and reports to understand user interactions.

2. **Customer Data Platform (CDP)** - The data foundation that collects, unifies, and manages user data from multiple sources, providing identity resolution and data quality management.

3. **Experiment** - A feature flagging and A/B testing solution that enables teams to test hypotheses and measure impact using the Analytics platform.

4. **Session Replay** - A qualitative analysis tool that records user sessions, providing visual context to the quantitative data in Analytics.

5. **Guides and Surveys** - An engagement tool for in-app messaging and feedback collection, allowing teams to act on insights from Analytics.

These products form a closed loop where teams can identify opportunities in Analytics, test solutions with Experiment, validate results in Analytics, and engage users with Guides and Surveys, all built on the unified data foundation of the CDP.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Ampli**: A type-safe wrapper for Amplitude SDKs that ensures consistent event tracking based on a Tracking Plan.

- **Charts**: Visualization tools in Analytics including Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, Event Segmentation, and Pathfinder.

- **Destination Catalog**: A collection of integration endpoints where Amplitude can send data, including marketing platforms, data warehouses, and business intelligence tools.

- **Source Catalog**: A collection of data sources that can feed into Amplitude, including mobile apps, websites, and third-party platforms.

- **Feature Experiment**: A controlled test that compares different variations of a feature to measure impact on user behavior.

- **Warehouse-native Amplitude**: A deployment option that loads data directly from data warehouses without requiring API keys.

- **Tracking Plan**: A schema that defines the events and properties to be tracked across an organization's digital properties.

- **Cohorts**: Groups of users who share common behaviors or attributes, used for segmentation and targeting.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's architecture follows a layered approach:

1. **Data Foundation Layer** (CDP):
   - Collects data from various sources
   - Resolves user identities across platforms
   - Ensures data quality and consistency

2. **Analytics Layer**:
   - Transforms raw data into actionable insights
   - Provides visualization tools for different analysis types
   - Enables user segmentation and cohort creation

3. **Activation Layer** (Experiment, Guides and Surveys):
   - Enables teams to act on insights
   - Tests hypotheses through experiments
   - Engages users with targeted messaging

4. **Qualitative Context Layer** (Session Replay):
   - Provides visual context to quantitative data
   - Helps understand user frustrations and behaviors
   - Validates insights from analytics

This integration enables cross-product workflows such as:
- Identifying a drop-off point in a funnel (Analytics)
- Watching session recordings to understand the issue (Session Replay)
- Testing a solution (Experiment)
- Measuring the impact (Analytics)
- Engaging affected users (Guides and Surveys)

## API Endpoints and SDK Implementation

### API Endpoints

Amplitude offers several API categories:

- **Analytics APIs**:
  - `/apis/analytics/export` - Export raw event data
  - `/apis/analytics/chart` - Programmatically create charts
  - `/apis/analytics/cohorts` - Manage user cohorts

- **Experiment APIs**:
  - `/apis/experiment/management` - Configure experiments and feature flags
  - `/apis/experiment/evaluation` - Evaluate feature flags for users

- **Guides and Surveys APIs**:
  - `/apis/guides-and-surveys/translation` - Manage content translations

Authentication uses various credentials:
- API Key and Secret Key for Analytics APIs
- Deployment Keys for Experiment client-side evaluation
- Management API Key for Experiment configuration
- Data API Token for Data APIs

### SDK Implementation

Amplitude provides SDKs for multiple platforms:

1. **Analytics SDKs**:
   - Web (JavaScript)
   - Mobile (iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter)
   - Gaming (Unity, Unreal)
   - Server-side (Node.js, Python, Java, Go)

2. **Experiment SDKs**:
   - Client-side (JavaScript, iOS, Android)
   - Server-side (Node.js, Java, Go, Python)

3. **Session Replay SDKs**:
   - Web (JavaScript)
   - Mobile (iOS, Android)

4. **Guides and Surveys SDKs**:
   - Web (JavaScript)
   - Mobile (iOS, Android)

The Ampli CLI tool generates type-safe wrappers for these SDKs based on a Tracking Plan, ensuring consistent event tracking across implementations and reducing errors in data collection.
