Amplitude is a comprehensive customer analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of several interconnected products that work together to create a complete customer analytics ecosystem.

## Core Product Architecture

The Amplitude ecosystem is built around four primary product areas that integrate seamlessly to provide end-to-end customer analytics capabilities:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational behavioral analytics engine, offering sophisticated charting capabilities including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle analysis, Personas, Stickiness analysis, Revenue LTV tracking, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Data Tables, and Compass. These charts enable deep behavioral analysis across the entire customer journey, from acquisition through retention and monetization.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced statistical analysis, supporting both client-side and server-side experimentation workflows. The platform includes experiment theory, advanced techniques, workflow management, troubleshooting tools, and "under the hood" technical implementation details.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user session recordings to provide qualitative insights that complement quantitative behavioral data, enabling teams to understand not just what users do, but how they interact with products.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** facilitates in-product user research and guidance through targeted surveys and user onboarding flows, enabling teams to collect qualitative feedback and guide user experiences.

## Data Infrastructure and Integration Ecosystem

Amplitude's data infrastructure centers around a comprehensive Customer Data Platform (CDP) that includes robust source and destination catalogs for data unification and activation:

**Source Catalog** comprises over 80 integrations across marketing automation, attribution, customer engagement, subscription management, data warehouses, and experimentation platforms. Key integration categories include marketing-automation, attribution, subscription-management, customer-engagement, collaboration, experimentation, privacy, website, qualitative-feedback, and CDP connectors.

**Destination Catalog** enables data activation by syncing behavioral segments and insights to downstream marketing, personalization, and activation platforms, creating closed-loop optimization workflows.

**Data Management** includes advanced capabilities for audience segmentation, data governance, warehouse-native architecture, PII handling, and comprehensive data sources management with support for real-time streaming, batch processing, and Change Data Capture (CDC) operations.

## SDK and API Ecosystem

Amplitude provides extensive instrumentation capabilities through platform-specific SDKs and comprehensive APIs:

**Analytics SDKs** support all major platforms including Browser (JavaScript), iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine, enabling comprehensive event tracking across web, mobile, and server-side applications.

**Experiment SDKs** provide feature flagging and experimentation capabilities across the same platform ecosystem, enabling consistent A/B testing implementation regardless of technical architecture.

**Ampli** serves as Amplitude's type-safe analytics wrapper that generates strongly-typed tracking libraries based on predefined tracking plans, ensuring data quality and consistency across development teams.

**API Infrastructure** includes the Analytics API for event ingestion, Experiment APIs for feature flag management, and Guides and Surveys API for in-product experience management, all supporting both US and EU data residency requirements.

## Administrative and Enterprise Capabilities

Amplitude provides comprehensive enterprise-grade administrative functionality:

**Account Management** includes user provisioning, role-based access control, team management, and organizational hierarchy support for complex enterprise deployments.

**Single Sign-On (SSO)** supports SAML and OAuth integration with enterprise identity providers for seamless authentication workflows.

**Billing and Usage Management** provides detailed usage tracking, cost optimization tools, and flexible billing models to support organizations of all sizes.

**Data Governance** includes comprehensive privacy controls, PII handling, data retention policies, and GDPR compliance tools for regulatory adherence.

## Technical Implementation and Migration Support

The platform provides extensive technical resources for implementation and migration:

**Get Started Resources** include comprehensive onboarding guides, implementation best practices, and quick-start templates for rapid deployment.

**Migration Tools** support data migration from other analytics platforms with automated mapping, data validation, and transition planning resources.

**Instrumentation Guidance** provides detailed implementation patterns, SDK configuration, and event tracking best practices across all supported platforms.

**FAQ and Troubleshooting** offers comprehensive technical support resources, common implementation patterns, and platform-specific troubleshooting guides.

## Key Technical Nomenclature

**Mirror Sync**: Advanced data synchronization supporting INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations for maintaining consistency between source systems and Amplitude.

**Change Data Capture (CDC)**: Real-time data synchronization technology that captures and processes data changes as they occur in source systems.

**Attribution API**: Specialized API for processing marketing attribution data from Mobile Measurement Partners (MMPs) with 72-hour attribution windows and Advertising ID matching.

**Cohorts**: Behavioral user segments that can be created in Amplitude Analytics and activated across the destination catalog for targeted marketing and personalization.

**Event Streaming**: Bidirectional data flow enabling both event ingestion and audience activation across integrated platforms.

## API Endpoints and Integration Patterns

Core API endpoints include:
- **HTTP V2 API**: `api.amplitude.com/2/httpapi` (US) / `api.eu.amplitude.com/2/httpapi` (EU) for event ingestion
- **Attribution API**: Real-time marketing attribution data processing
- **Lookup Table API**: CSV data import and property enrichment
- **User Privacy API**: GDPR compliance and data deletion requests

Integration patterns support webhook configurations, OAuth authentication, API key management, and region-specific data residency compliance across all platform integrations.

## Ecosystem Integration and Workflow

Amplitude's architecture enables sophisticated analytics workflows where behavioral data flows from source systems through the analytics engine to generate insights that can be activated through destination integrations. The platform supports both real-time streaming and batch processing, with advanced features like warehouse-native architecture for organizations with existing data lake/warehouse investments.

The ecosystem is designed to support the complete customer analytics lifecycle: data collection through comprehensive SDKs and source integrations, analysis through advanced charting and segmentation capabilities, experimentation through A/B testing and feature flags, and activation through destination integrations and audience syndication. This creates a unified platform for data-driven product development and growth optimization.
