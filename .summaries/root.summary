Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools for data collection, analysis, feature experimentation, and user engagement optimization. The platform consists of several interconnected products designed to support the complete product development and optimization lifecycle.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform is built around **Amplitude Analytics** as the foundational layer, which provides event tracking, user behavior analysis, and comprehensive charting capabilities. This connects to **Amplitude Experiment** for feature flagging and A/B testing, **Amplitude CDP (Customer Data Platform)** for data management and integration, and **Amplitude Session Replay** for user experience analysis. Additional products include **Amplitude Guides and Surveys** for user engagement and **Web Experiment** for browser-based testing.

The analytics engine supports multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, and Revenue LTV. Each chart type serves specific analytical use cases and integrates with the broader experimentation and data management ecosystem.

## Data Infrastructure and Integration

The CDP component manages data flow through **Source Catalog** and **Destination Catalog** systems, enabling integration with external platforms. The platform supports **Warehouse-native Amplitude** for organizations using cloud data warehouses, and includes **Audiences** functionality for user segmentation and targeting.

Data collection occurs through comprehensive SDK support across platforms including Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine SDKs. The **Ampli** code generation tool provides type-safe analytics implementation, while various APIs enable programmatic access to platform functionality.

## Experimentation and Feature Management

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging capabilities with support for advanced techniques, statistical analysis through experiment theory, and comprehensive workflow management. The system includes experiment troubleshooting tools and integrates with external platforms through the Experiment Results feature, which allows analysis of experiments conducted on third-party feature flagging platforms.

The experimentation workflow encompasses variant management, exposure tracking, statistical analysis using methods like sequential testing, t-tests, and CUPED (Controlled-experiment Using Pre-Experiment Data), and comprehensive results visualization through dedicated experiment results charts.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Analytics Concepts:**
- **Events**: User actions tracked within applications
- **Properties**: Attributes associated with events or users
- **Segments**: Filtered groups of users or events based on specific criteria
- **Cohorts**: User groups defined by shared characteristics or behaviors
- **Funnels**: Sequential user action flows with conversion tracking
- **Retention**: User return behavior measurement over time periods

**Experimentation Terminology:**
- **Feature Flags**: Boolean controls for feature activation/deactivation
- **Variants**: Different versions of features being tested
- **Exposure Events**: Tracking when users encounter experiment variants
- **Statistical Significance**: Confidence level in experiment results
- **Lift**: Performance improvement measurement between variants

**Data Management:**
- **Sources**: Data input integrations from various platforms
- **Destinations**: Data output integrations to external systems
- **Transformations**: Data processing and modification rules
- **Schemas**: Data structure definitions and validation rules

## API Endpoints and Technical Integration

The platform provides multiple API categories:

**Analytics APIs** (`/apis/analytics/`) enable programmatic access to event data, user properties, and chart configurations. **Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) support feature flag management, variant configuration, and results retrieval. **Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) manages user engagement campaigns.

SDK routes follow the pattern `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/` for analytics SDKs and `/sdks/experiment-sdks/` for experimentation SDKs. The Ampli code generation tool is accessible through `/sdks/ampli/` endpoints.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

The platform includes comprehensive administrative capabilities through **Account Management** (`/admin/account-management/`), **Billing and Use** monitoring (`/admin/billing-use/`), and **Single Sign-on** integration (`/admin/single-sign-on/`). These features support enterprise deployment requirements and organizational governance.

**PII Integrations** (`/data/pii/`) provide privacy-compliant data handling, while the **Partners** ecosystem (`/partners/`) enables third-party integrations and marketplace functionality.

## Multi-language and Accessibility

The platform supports internationalization with **Japanese Translation** capabilities and includes comprehensive **FAQ and Troubleshooting** resources. The documentation structure accommodates multiple sites (English and Japanese) with localized content propagation.

## Technical Implementation Patterns

Route structures follow consistent patterns:
- Analytics features: `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/`
- Experimentation: `/feature-experiment/{feature}/`
- Data management: `/data/{component}/`
- SDKs: `/sdks/{category}/{platform}/`
- APIs: `/apis/{product}/`

The platform uses mount points for content organization, preview targets for development workflows, and injection parameters for navigation and branding consistency across different product areas. Date behavior controls content visibility with past content public and future content private by default.
