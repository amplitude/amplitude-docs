## Amplitude Analytics and Experimentation Platform

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools for product analytics, feature experimentation, user behavior analysis, and data management. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

**Core Analytics Platform:**
The foundation centers around Amplitude Analytics, which provides behavioral analytics through multiple chart types and visualization tools. The analytics engine supports event segmentation, funnel analysis, retention analysis, user journey mapping, and cohort analysis through specialized chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Revenue LTV, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, User Sessions, Data Tables, and Compass.

**Experimentation Framework:**
Amplitude Experiment provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with deep integration into the analytics platform. The experimentation framework includes advanced techniques, experiment theory, workflow management, and specialized experiment results charts. The system supports both client-side and server-side experimentation with comprehensive SDK coverage.

**Data Infrastructure:**
The Customer Data Platform (CDP) manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation through source and destination catalogs. The platform supports warehouse-native implementations, audience management, and extensive third-party integrations. Data flows through the system via APIs, SDKs, and direct database connections.

**User Experience Tools:**
Session Replay captures and reconstructs user interactions, while Guides and Surveys enables in-product messaging and feedback collection. These tools integrate with the core analytics platform to provide comprehensive user behavior insights.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Analytics Concepts:**
- **Events** - User actions tracked within applications (clicks, page views, purchases)
- **Properties** - Attributes associated with events (user properties, event properties)
- **Cohorts** - User segments based on shared characteristics or behaviors
- **Funnels** - Sequential user journey analysis through defined conversion steps
- **Retention** - User return behavior analysis over time periods
- **Segmentation** - Event analysis broken down by user or event properties

**Experimentation Terminology:**
- **Feature Flags** - Boolean toggles controlling feature availability
- **Variants** - Different versions of features being tested
- **Allocation** - Percentage of users exposed to experiments
- **Statistical Significance** - Confidence level in experiment results
- **Lift** - Percentage improvement in key metrics

**Data Management:**
- **Sources** - Data input connections (SDKs, APIs, third-party integrations)
- **Destinations** - Data output connections (warehouses, marketing tools, analytics platforms)
- **Transformations** - Data processing rules applied during ingestion
- **Schemas** - Data structure definitions for events and properties

**SDK Architecture:**
- **Analytics SDKs** - Core tracking libraries for various platforms
- **Experiment SDKs** - Feature flag and experimentation libraries
- **Ampli** - Type-safe analytics implementation tool
- **Session Replay Plugins** - User session recording capabilities

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

**Multi-Product Synergy:**
The platform operates as an integrated ecosystem where analytics data informs experimentation decisions, session replay provides qualitative context for quantitative metrics, and guides/surveys enable direct user feedback collection. Experiment results automatically flow into analytics charts, while session replay data correlates with analytics events through shared session identifiers.

**Data Flow Architecture:**
Data ingestion occurs through multiple pathways including client-side SDKs (Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal), server-side SDKs (Node.js, Python, Java, Go), and direct API integrations. The Analytics API (`/apis/analytics/`) handles event ingestion, while the Experiment APIs (`/apis/experiment/`) manage feature flag configurations and assignments.

**Third-Party Integration Ecosystem:**
The platform maintains extensive integration catalogs with hundreds of sources and destinations. Source integrations include marketing platforms, customer support tools, and business applications. Destination integrations enable data activation across marketing automation, business intelligence, and operational systems.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Core API Routes:**
- `/apis/analytics/` - Event ingestion and analytics data retrieval
- `/apis/experiment/` - Feature flag management and assignment
- `/apis/guides-and-surveys/` - In-product messaging and survey management
- `/sdks/analytics/` - Analytics SDK documentation and implementation guides
- `/sdks/experiment-sdks/` - Experimentation SDK resources
- `/sdks/ampli/` - Type-safe analytics implementation tools

**SDK Implementation Patterns:**
Analytics SDKs follow consistent patterns across platforms with methods like `track()`, `identify()`, `setUserProperties()`, and `flush()`. Experiment SDKs provide `fetch()`, `variant()`, and `exposure()` methods for feature flag management. Session Replay integrates through plugins with methods like `getSessionReplayProperties()` and privacy controls.

**Administrative and Management Tools:**
The platform includes comprehensive administrative capabilities through `/admin/` routes covering account management, billing and usage monitoring, and single sign-on configuration. Migration tools (`/migration/`) support platform transitions, while troubleshooting resources (`/faq/`) provide implementation guidance.

**Internationalization and Accessibility:**
The platform supports multiple languages with dedicated Japanese translation collections and localized content delivery. The system maintains accessibility standards and provides comprehensive documentation across all supported languages and regions.
