- **Sessions**: Periods of continuous user activity, typically with configurable timeout periods
- **Cohorts**: Groups of users sharing common characteristics or behaviors
- **Funnels**: Sequential series of events representing a conversion path
- **Retention**: Analysis of returning user behavior over time periods
- **Journeys**: Visualization of user paths through a product
- **Instrumentation**: The process of implementing tracking in applications
- **Ampli**: Amplitude's code generation tool for type-safe analytics implementation
- **Source Catalog**: Collection of pre-built integrations for data ingestion
- **Destination Catalog**: Integration points for exporting data to other platforms

## API Endpoints and Implementation

Amplitude provides several API endpoints and implementation patterns:

### Analytics API
For querying analytics data programmatically

### SDK Implementation Examples
Browser SDK:
```javascript
import * as amplitude from '@amplitude/analytics-browser';

amplitude.init('API_KEY', {
  // Configuration options
});

amplitude.track('Event Name', {
  // Event properties
});
```

Session Replay:
```javascript
import { sessionReplayPlugin } from '@amplitude/session-replay-browser';

amplitude.init('API_KEY', {
  plugins: [sessionReplayPlugin()]
});
```

### Experiment API
For managing and querying experiment results programmatically

### Data Export API
For extracting raw data from Amplitude

The platform supports different implementation approaches based on organizational needs, from simple client-side tracking to sophisticated server-side and data warehouse integrations, with specialized migration paths from other analytics platforms.
