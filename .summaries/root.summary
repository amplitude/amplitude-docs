# Amplitude Product Ecosystem

## Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics platform that helps businesses understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth. The platform enables data collection, analysis, experimentation, and activation through a suite of interconnected products and features.

Key capabilities include:
- User behavior tracking and product performance analytics
- Experimentation tools for testing and optimization
- Data management for collecting, organizing, and activating user data
- Cross-platform SDKs for behavioral data collection
- Integration with third-party tools and services
- Advanced visualization and reporting for insights discovery

## Product Relationships and Features

The Amplitude ecosystem consists of these interconnected products:

1. **Analytics** - Core platform for understanding user behavior through charts, funnels, retention analysis, and visualization tools.

2. **Experiment** - Feature experimentation platform for testing hypotheses and measuring impact on key metrics.

3. **CDP (Customer Data Platform)** - Data management solution for collecting, organizing, and activating user data.

4. **Data** - Foundation for managing data sources, audiences, and data governance.

5. **SDKs** - Client and server libraries for various platforms (Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Node.js, Python, Java, Go) enabling instrumentation and data collection.

6. **Ampli** - Code generation tool creating type-safe wrappers around Amplitude SDKs.

7. **APIs** - RESTful interfaces for programmatic interaction with Amplitude services.

8. **Source/Destination Catalog** - Integration hub connecting Amplitude with third-party tools and services.

9. **Session Replay** - Visual recording of user sessions for qualitative analysis.

10. **Admin** - Account management, billing, and single sign-on capabilities.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event** - A discrete user action or system occurrence tracked in Amplitude
- **User Properties** - Attributes associated with individual users
- **Event Properties** - Metadata associated with specific events
- **Cohort** - A defined segment of users sharing common characteristics or behaviors
- **Funnel Analysis** - Tracking user progression through a sequence of events
- **Retention Analysis** - Measuring how users continue to engage over time
- **Journeys** - Visualization of user paths through a product
- **Impact Analysis** - Measuring the effect of product changes on key metrics
- **Experiment** - A controlled test comparing variations of a feature
- **Instrumentation** - The process of implementing tracking code in applications
- **Source** - An origin point for data flowing into Amplitude
- **Destination** - A target for data or cohorts flowing out of Amplitude
- **Taxonomy** - The organizational structure of events and properties
- **Tracking Plan** - A specification for what events and properties to track

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's products work together in a cohesive ecosystem across multiple layers:

1. **Data Collection Layer** - SDKs and Source Catalog enable data collection from various platforms and third-party tools.

2. **Data Management Layer** - CDP and Data products organize, govern, and prepare data for analysis.

3. **Analysis Layer** - Analytics provides visualization and insight discovery through charts, funnels, and retention analysis.

4. **Activation Layer** - Experiment and Destination Catalog enable acting on insights through experimentation and integration with marketing tools.

5. **Administration Layer** - Account Management, Billing, and Single Sign-On provide organizational control.

The platform supports a complete analytics lifecycle:
- Collect data through SDKs and integrations
- Organize and manage data in the CDP
- Analyze behavior with Analytics tools
- Test hypotheses with Experiment
- Activate insights through integrations and cohort exports

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

Amplitude provides several API endpoints:

1. **HTTP API V2** - For sending events
   - Endpoint: `https://api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`

2. **Identify API** - For updating user properties
   - Endpoint: `https://api2.amplitude.com/identify`

3. **Experiment API** - For fetching experiment variants and reporting results

4. **Chart Annotations API** - For programmatically creating annotations
   - Endpoint: `https://analytics.amplitude.com/api/2/annotations`

5. **Cohort API** - For managing and exporting user cohorts
   - Endpoint: `https://amplitude.com/api/2/cohorts`

6. **Export API** - For exporting raw event data
   - Endpoint: `https://amplitude.com/api/2/export`

SDK implementation example:
```javascript
// Browser SDK example
amplitude.init('API_KEY');
amplitude.track('Event Name', {
  eventProperty1: 'value1',
  eventProperty2: 'value2'
});
```

Ampli SDK type-safe wrapper example:
```typescript
// Ampli SDK example
ampli.load();
ampli.trackEventName({
  eventProperty1: 'value1',
  eventProperty2: 'value2'
});
```

The platform supports both client-side and server-side tracking, with options for real-time event streaming and batch processing.
