- **APIs** - REST APIs for Analytics, Experiment, and Guides and Surveys

**Additional Products:**
- **Session Replay** - User session recording and analysis
- **Guides and Surveys** - In-product user engagement and feedback collection

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Analytics Concepts:**
- **Events** - User actions tracked within applications (clicks, page views, purchases, etc.)
- **Properties** - Attributes associated with events or users
- **Cohorts** - User segments based on shared characteristics or behaviors
- **Funnels** - Multi-step user journey analysis
- **Retention** - User return behavior analysis over time
- **Segmentation** - Breaking down events by various dimensions

**Experimentation Terms:**
- **Feature Flags** - Configuration switches to control feature availability
- **Variants** - Different versions of features being tested
- **Statistical Significance** - Confidence level in experiment results
- **Lift** - Performance improvement measured in experiments

**Data Management:**
- **Taxonomy** - Standardized event and property naming conventions
- **Tracking Plan** - Structured schema defining what events and properties to collect
- **Data Governance** - Policies and procedures for data quality and compliance
- **PII (Personally Identifiable Information)** - Sensitive user data requiring special handling

**Technical Infrastructure:**
- **SDK (Software Development Kit)** - Libraries for implementing Amplitude tracking
- **API Endpoints** - HTTP interfaces for data transmission and retrieval
- **Instrumentation** - Process of adding tracking code to applications
- **Real-time vs Batch Processing** - Different data processing modes
