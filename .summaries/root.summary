### Experiment
Platform for A/B testing and feature experimentation, including:
- Experiment design and implementation
- Statistical analysis of experiment results
- Web Experiment capabilities
- Feature flag management

### Data Management
Handles data collection, processing, and distribution:
- Data Sources for collection configuration
- Audience segmentation and management
- Customer Data Platform (CDP) functionality
- PII handling and integration

### SDKs
Client and server libraries for data collection across platforms:
- Browser SDK for web applications
- Mobile SDKs (iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter)
- Server SDKs (Node.js, Python, Java, Go)
- Gaming SDKs (Unity, Unreal)
- Ampli wrapper for type-safe implementation

### APIs
Programmatic interfaces for platform interaction:

- Experiment APIs for programmatic experiment management

### Admin and Account Management
Tools for platform administration:
- Billing and usage monitoring
- Single Sign-On implementation
- User and organization management

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: A discrete user action or system occurrence tracked in Amplitude
- **User Properties**: Attributes associated with users (demographics, preferences)
- **Session**: A period of continuous user engagement with an application
- **Funnel**: A series of events representing a conversion path
- **Retention**: Measurement of user return rates over time
- **Cohort**: A group of users sharing common characteristics or behaviors
- **Experiment**: A controlled test comparing different variations of a feature
- **Source**: An origin point for data collection
- **Destination**: A system where Amplitude sends processed data
- **Ampli**: A code generation tool creating type-safe wrappers for tracking plans

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's platform components work together in an integrated workflow:

### Data Collection Flow
- SDKs collect user interaction data across platforms
- Events are transmitted to Amplitude via HTTP APIs
- Ampli ensures data quality through type-safe tracking

### Analysis and Visualization
- Collected data populates Analytics dashboards and charts
- Various visualization tools provide insights into user behavior
- Compass offers guided analysis of key metrics

### Experimentation Workflow
- Experiment platform leverages collected data for test evaluation
- Experiment SDKs manage feature flag delivery and user assignment
- Impact Analysis quantifies experiment effects on key metrics

### Data Management and Integration
- Source Catalog manages incoming data connections
- Destination Catalog handles outgoing data connections
- CDP enables real-time audience syncing with marketing tools
