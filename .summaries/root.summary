Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to track, analyze, and optimize user behavior across digital products. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment (feature flagging and A/B testing), Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The platform operates on a hierarchical structure where **Organizations** contain multiple **Projects**, each representing distinct applications or data sources. This enables cross-project analysis through **Portfolio** views that can merge 5-10 projects using identity resolution via User ID/Device ID matching and the User Mapping API.

**Core Analytics Engine**: The analytics foundation provides event tracking through multiple SDKs (Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, Unreal) with the **Ampli** wrapper providing type-safe analytics implementation. Data flows through the Analytics API for ingestion and various chart types for visualization.

**Experimentation Platform**: Amplitude Experiment integrates with the analytics engine to provide feature flagging, A/B testing, and advanced experimentation capabilities. It includes dedicated Experiment SDKs, APIs, and specialized chart types like Experiment Results for analyzing test performance.

**Session Replay Integration**: Functions as middleware/plugin extending existing Analytics SDKs to capture user interactions, providing visual insights through session recordings and heatmaps while maintaining privacy controls.

**Customer Data Platform**: Manages data flow through Sources (data ingestion), Destinations (data activation), and Audiences (user segmentation), with extensive integration catalogs supporting hundreds of third-party tools.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**User Roles and Permissions**: Four-tier hierarchy including Viewer (read-only), Member (content creation), Manager (project administration), and Admin (organization-wide control). **Permission Groups** enable bulk assignment of project permissions.

**API Infrastructure**: Distinguishes between **API keys** (data ingestion) and **Secret keys** (data export/analysis), supporting up to 50 active keys per project. **SCIM keys** enable identity provider integration.

**Chart Types**: Comprehensive analytics visualization including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Revenue LTV, Personas, Compass, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, and Data Tables.

**Experimentation Terms**: **Feature flags** control feature rollouts, **experiments** test variations, **advanced techniques** include statistical methods, and **experiment theory** covers statistical foundations.

**Data Management**: **Self-service data deletion** supports GDPR compliance, **behavioral cohorts** enable user segmentation, and **derived properties** enhance analysis capabilities.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

**Identity and Access Management**: SCIM 2.0 provisioning integrates with identity providers like Okta, supporting automated user/group management. Single Sign-On (SSO) provides enterprise authentication workflows.

**Third-Party Integrations**: Extensive partner ecosystem includes tag management (Google Tag Manager), customer data platforms (Segment, Rudderstack), and hundreds of destinations through the integration catalog. The platform supports both source and destination integrations with taxonomy-based categorization.

**Multi-Language Support**: Japanese translation support indicates international deployment capabilities with localized content management.

**Enterprise Features**: Advanced capabilities include Portfolio cross-project analysis, Scale behavioral sampling for high-volume customers, warehouse-native deployment options, and PII management integrations.

## API Endpoints and Technical Integration

**Core APIs**:
- Analytics API (`/apis/analytics/`) - Event ingestion and data retrieval
- Experiment APIs (`/apis/experiment/`) - Feature flag and experiment management  
- Guides and Surveys API (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) - In-app messaging and feedback
- User Management API - SCIM 2.0 provisioning and user administration
- User Privacy API - GDPR compliance and data deletion
- Dashboard Rest API/HTTP API - Programmatic dashboard and data access

**SDK Implementation Patterns**:
- Analytics SDKs follow platform-specific patterns (`/sdks/analytics/{platform}/`)
- Experiment SDKs provide feature flag evaluation (`/sdks/experiment-sdks/`)
- Ampli provides type-safe wrappers (`/sdks/ampli/`)
- Session Replay implements as plugins/middleware extending Analytics SDKs

**Technical Routes**: The platform uses structured URL routing with patterns like `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/`, `/feature-experiment/{section}/`, `/data/{data-feature}/`, and `/admin/{admin-function}/` indicating a well-organized information architecture.

**Migration and Troubleshooting**: Dedicated migration paths (`/migration/`) and comprehensive FAQ/troubleshooting resources (`/faq/`) support implementation and platform transitions.

The platform demonstrates sophisticated content management with mount points, taxonomies, preview targets, and injection parameters, indicating a mature documentation system supporting complex product relationships and user workflows.
