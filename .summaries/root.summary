Amplitude is a comprehensive behavioral analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of four core products: Analytics for behavioral analysis, Experiment for feature flagging and A/B testing, Session Replay for user experience optimization, and Guides and Surveys for in-product user engagement.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

**Analytics** serves as the foundational layer, providing behavioral event tracking through multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Compass, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Revenue LTV, Data Tables, and Experiment Results. These charts enable comprehensive user behavior analysis from acquisition through retention and monetization.

**Experiment** (Amplitude Experiment) integrates deeply with Analytics, providing feature flagging, A/B testing, and experimentation capabilities. It includes advanced techniques, experiment theory, workflow management, troubleshooting tools, and "under the hood" technical documentation. Experiment Results charts within Analytics provide statistical analysis of experiment performance.

**Session Replay** captures and analyzes user interactions, providing visual context to behavioral data collected through Analytics. This creates a comprehensive view of user experience by combining quantitative behavioral metrics with qualitative interaction recordings.

**Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user engagement through targeted messaging and feedback collection, with data flowing back into Analytics for behavioral impact analysis.

The **Customer Data Platform (CDP)** functionality centralizes data management through Sources, Destinations, Audiences, and warehouse-native capabilities, creating unified customer profiles across touchpoints.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events**: Discrete user actions tracked within products (e.g., button clicks, page views, purchases) that form the foundation of all behavioral analysis.

**Properties**: Attributes associated with events (event properties) or users (user properties) that enable segmentation and filtering in analysis.

**Cohorts/Audiences**: User segments defined by behavioral criteria, demographic attributes, or custom properties that can be analyzed and activated across platforms.

**Funnels**: Sequential user journey analysis measuring conversion rates between defined steps in user workflows.

**Retention**: Analysis of user return behavior over time, measuring product stickiness and long-term engagement patterns.

**Amplitude Data Taxonomy**: Standardized event and property naming conventions ensuring data consistency across implementations.

**Ampli**: Code-generation tool that creates type-safe analytics libraries, ensuring implementation accuracy and reducing instrumentation errors.

**Mirror Sync**: Real-time data synchronization using Change Data Capture (CDC) for maintaining consistency between data warehouses and Amplitude.

**Attribution Windows**: Time periods for associating user actions with marketing touchpoints, critical for accurate campaign performance measurement.

**Feature Flags**: Dynamic configuration controls enabling real-time feature rollouts, targeting, and experimentation without code deployments.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude operates as the central behavioral analytics hub within organizations' technology stacks, integrating with over 60 data sources through the Source Catalog and numerous destinations through the Destination Catalog. The platform supports both upstream data ingestion from marketing platforms, data warehouses, customer engagement tools, and attribution providers, while enabling downstream activation through cohort exports and API integrations.

The **Source Catalog** includes integrations with major platforms across categories:
- **Data Warehouses**: Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks for enterprise data pipeline integration
- **Marketing Attribution**: AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch for mobile attribution tracking  
- **Customer Engagement**: Intercom, Braze, OneSignal for messaging and support platforms
- **Subscription Management**: RevenueCat, Stripe for revenue and subscription analytics
- **Experimentation**: Optimizely, Split for cross-platform experiment coordination

The **Destination Catalog** enables behavioral data activation across marketing automation, advertising platforms, customer success tools, and data warehouses, creating closed-loop optimization workflows.

**Regional deployment** supports both US (api.amplitude.com) and EU (api.eu.amplitude.com) endpoints for data residency compliance and GDPR requirements.

## Technical Implementation and API Specifications

**Analytics SDKs** provide comprehensive instrumentation across platforms:
- **Client-side**: Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal for user-facing applications
- **Server-side**: Node.js, Python, Java, Go for backend event tracking
- **Analytics API**: RESTful endpoints for direct event ingestion and data export

**Experiment SDKs** enable feature flag evaluation and experiment participation across the same platform matrix, with consistent APIs for flag evaluation, user targeting, and experiment assignment.

**Key API Endpoints**:
- **Analytics API**: `/2/httpapi` for event ingestion, `/2/export` for data export
- **Attribution API**: Specialized endpoint for marketing attribution data with advertising ID requirements
- **Experiment APIs**: Feature flag evaluation, experiment configuration, and results analysis
- **Guides and Surveys API**: In-product messaging and survey management

**Authentication** utilizes project-specific API keys with regional endpoint configuration for data residency compliance.

**Ampli Implementation**: Code-generation workflow creating type-safe analytics libraries that enforce data taxonomy compliance and reduce implementation errors through compile-time validation.

**Webhook Support**: Real-time event streaming from email marketing platforms, payment processors, and customer engagement tools using standardized webhook configurations.

**Data Governance**: Comprehensive privacy controls, data retention policies, PII handling capabilities, and compliance frameworks supporting GDPR, CCPA, and other regulatory requirements.

The platform architecture enables organizations to create unified customer data platforms where behavioral insights drive product optimization, marketing effectiveness, and user experience improvements across the entire customer lifecycle.
