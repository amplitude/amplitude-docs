## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Collections**: Content groupings organized by product area, feature, or content type, defined in YAML files.

**Mount Points**: References to specific entry points that serve as the root for a collection's content structure.

**Routes**: URL patterns defining how content is accessed, following patterns like:
- `/analytics/{slug}` for analytics documentation
- `/feature-experiment/{slug}` for experiment documentation
- `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/{slug}` for SDK documentation
- `/apis/{product}/{slug}` for API documentation
- `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/{slug}` for chart-specific documentation

**Date Behavior**: Rules determining content visibility based on publication dates:
```yaml
date_behavior:
  past: public
  future: private
```

**Preview Targets**: Configuration for content preview functionality:
```yaml
preview_targets:
  - label: Entry
    url: '{permalink}'
    refresh: true
```

**Nav Title Injection**: Custom navigation labels applied to content sections:
```yaml
inject:
  nav_title: analytics
```

**Structure Root**: Boolean setting that determines if a collection appears at the root level of navigation.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The documentation platform integrates with Amplitude's broader product ecosystem through:

1. **Analytics Integration**: Documentation for the full analytics workflow from data collection to visualization and analysis.

2. **Experiment Integration**: Comprehensive documentation for A/B testing and feature flag capabilities.

3. **Data Platform Integration**: Documentation for the data infrastructure that powers Amplitude's products.

4. **Developer Tools Integration**: SDK documentation across multiple platforms.

5. **Cross-Product Features**: Documentation for features that span multiple products.

The platform uses a consistent URL structure organized by product area:
- Product documentation: `/[product]/{slug}`
- SDK documentation: `/sdks/[product]/[platform]/{slug}`
- API documentation: `/apis/[product]/{slug}`
- Chart documentation: `/analytics/charts/[chart-type]/{slug}`

This structure reflects the relationships between Amplitude's products and provides a coherent navigation experience for users.
