Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with advanced tools for understanding user behavior, optimizing product experiences, and driving data-driven growth. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products that span analytics, experimentation, customer data management, and user engagement capabilities.

## Core Product Architecture

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, offering sophisticated behavioral analysis through multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Impact Analysis, Revenue LTV, and Engagement Matrix. Each chart type provides specialized analytical capabilities for different aspects of user behavior analysis, from conversion optimization to cohort analysis and revenue attribution.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers enterprise-grade feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced statistical methods, multi-armed bandit optimization, and comprehensive experiment lifecycle management. The platform includes experiment theory documentation, advanced techniques, workflow management, troubleshooting resources, and "under the hood" technical implementation details.

**Amplitude CDP (Customer Data Platform)** provides unified data management through Sources, Destinations, Audiences, and warehouse-native capabilities. The platform includes extensive source and destination catalogs with integration taxonomies, PII management tools, and data governance features for enterprise-scale data operations.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user interactions for qualitative insights, enabling teams to understand user behavior beyond traditional analytics metrics.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** facilitates in-product user engagement through contextual messaging, feedback collection, and onboarding experiences.

## Multi-Platform SDK Ecosystem

The platform provides comprehensive SDK support across all major development environments:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal implementations, each with platform-specific optimizations and integration patterns. Routes follow the pattern `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/{slug}` for platform-specific documentation.

**Experiment SDKs** provide feature flagging and experimentation capabilities across platforms with consistent APIs and implementation patterns, documented under `/sdks/experiment-sdks/{slug}`.

**Ampli** serves as a type-safe wrapper system for analytics implementation, providing code generation and validation tools to ensure data quality and consistency across development teams.

## API Infrastructure

The platform exposes comprehensive REST APIs for programmatic access:

**Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/{slug}`) provides data extraction, event ingestion, and behavioral analysis capabilities for custom integrations and data pipeline automation.

**Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/{slug}`) enable programmatic experiment management, flag evaluation, and results analysis for automated experimentation workflows.

**Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/{slug}`) supports content management and engagement analytics for in-product messaging automation.

## Enterprise Administration and Management

**Account Management** (`/admin/account-management/{slug}`) provides organizational structure, user provisioning, and access control mechanisms.

**Single Sign-On** (`/admin/single-sign-on/{slug}`) enables enterprise authentication integration with SAML, OIDC, and other identity providers.

**Billing and Use** (`/admin/billing-use/{slug}`) offers usage monitoring, cost management, and subscription administration tools.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** represent discrete user actions tracked within applications, forming the foundation of all behavioral analysis. **Properties** provide contextual metadata for events and users, enabling sophisticated segmentation and analysis. **Segments** define user cohorts based on behavioral patterns, demographic attributes, or custom criteria.

**Experiments** encompass both feature flags for controlled rollouts and A/B tests for statistical comparison of variants. **Flags** control feature visibility and configuration, while **Variants** represent different experimental conditions or feature configurations.

**Charts** refer to analytical visualizations that transform raw event data into actionable insights. **Funnels** track multi-step conversion processes, **Cohorts** analyze user retention over time, and **Journeys** map user paths through product experiences.

**Sources** represent data ingestion points from various platforms and tools, while **Destinations** define where processed data flows for activation and analysis. **Audiences** are dynamic user segments that can be synchronized across marketing and product tools.

## Content Organization and Navigation

The documentation employs a hierarchical navigation structure with primary sections including:

- **Get Started** (`/get-started/{slug}`) for onboarding and initial setup
- **Analytics** (`/analytics/{slug}`) for behavioral analysis tools and methodologies  
- **Data** (`/data/{slug}`) for customer data platform capabilities
- **APIs** (`/apis/{slug}`) for programmatic integration documentation
- **SDKs** (`/sdks/{slug}`) for implementation guides across platforms
- **Feature Experiment** (`/feature-experiment/{slug}`) for experimentation workflows
- **Session Replay** (`/session-replay/{slug}`) for qualitative analysis tools
- **Admin** (`/admin/{slug}`) for organizational management

## Internationalization and Accessibility

The platform supports multi-language deployments with dedicated Japanese translation collections (`sites: jp`) and localization workflows. Content management includes revision control, preview capabilities, and publication workflows with date-based visibility controls (past: public, future: private).

## Integration Ecosystem

Amplitude integrates with hundreds of third-party tools through its source and destination catalogs, supporting marketing automation platforms, data warehouses, business intelligence tools, and customer engagement systems. The platform maintains taxonomies for integration categorization and provides standardized connection patterns for consistent data flow management.

**Partners** (`/partners/{slug}`) documentation covers strategic integrations and joint solutions, while **Migration** (`/migration/{slug}`) resources facilitate transitions from competing analytics platforms.

The platform's architecture enables organizations to build comprehensive data-driven product strategies that span the entire customer lifecycle, from acquisition and onboarding through retention and monetization, while maintaining unified data standards and analytical consistency across all touchpoints.
