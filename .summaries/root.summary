# Amplitude Product Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform designed to help organizations understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and make data-driven decisions. The platform consists of several integrated products that work together to provide a complete solution for product analytics and experimentation.

## Key Features and Concepts

Amplitude's platform includes:

- **Analytics** - Core capabilities for tracking, visualizing, and analyzing user behavior data
- **Experiment** - Feature flag and A/B testing platform for controlled experimentation
- **Data Management** - Tools for data collection, integration, and governance
- **SDKs & APIs** - Client and server libraries for integrating Amplitude across platforms
- **Administration** - Account management, billing, and security features

The platform supports various deployment options and integrates with numerous third-party tools through a comprehensive ecosystem of connectors.

## Product Relationships and Features

### Analytics Platform
The Analytics platform serves as the foundation of Amplitude, providing tools to understand user behavior:

- **Charts** - Visualization tools including event segmentation, funnels, retention analysis, user sessions, journeys, and impact analysis
- **Compass** - Feature for understanding user behavior patterns and correlations
- **Data Tables** - Tabular data visualization capabilities for detailed analysis

### Experiment Platform
Experiment enables product teams to test hypotheses and measure impact:

- **Feature Flags** - Toggle features on/off for specific user segments
- **A/B Testing** - Test different variants of features to measure impact on key metrics
- **SDKs** - Client and server libraries for implementing experiments across platforms
- **APIs** - Management and evaluation endpoints for experiment configuration
- **Workflow** - Processes for setting up, running, and analyzing experiments
- **Advanced Techniques** - Specialized experimentation methodologies for complex scenarios

### Data Platform
The Data Platform ensures quality data collection and distribution:

- **Sources** - Data ingestion points including a source catalog for third-party integrations
- **Destinations** - Data export options including a destination catalog
- **Audiences** - User segmentation capabilities for targeted analysis
- **CDP** - Customer Data Platform functionality for unified user profiles
- **PII Integrations** - Specialized handling of personally identifiable information

### SDK Ecosystem
Amplitude provides a comprehensive set of SDKs for implementation across platforms:

- **Analytics SDKs** - Platform-specific libraries for iOS, Android, Web, React Native, Unity, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, and Unreal
- **Ampli** - Code generation tool for type-safe analytics implementation
- **Experiment SDKs** - Libraries for implementing feature flags and experiments

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event** - A user action or system occurrence tracked in Amplitude
- **User** - An individual interacting with a product, identified by user_id or device_id
- **Session** - A period of continuous user engagement with a product
- **Funnel** - A sequence of events representing a user journey or conversion path
- **Retention** - Measurement of user return behavior over time
- **Variant** - A specific version of a feature in an experiment
- **Feature Flag** - A toggle that controls feature visibility or behavior
- **Deployment Key** - Authentication credential for Experiment evaluation
- **Source/Destination** - Data integration endpoints for ingestion/export
- **Cohort** - A group of users sharing common characteristics or behaviors

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude platform components are designed to work together seamlessly:

1. **Analytics** forms the core of the platform, providing insights into user behavior
2. **Experiment** leverages analytics data to test hypotheses and measure impact
3. **Data Management** tools ensure quality data collection and distribution
4. **SDKs** enable seamless integration across platforms and languages

The platform supports both client-side and server-side implementations, with appropriate deployment types and evaluation methods for each use case. Amplitude integrates with various data warehouses, allowing for warehouse-native implementations that sync data directly from storage systems like S3 or GCS.

## API Endpoints and Implementation Patterns

### Analytics API
- Base endpoint: `/apis/analytics/`
- Provides access to event data, user properties, and analysis results

### Experiment APIs
- Evaluation API: `GET /api/2/flags/evaluate` - Retrieves variant assignments
- Flags API: `GET /api/2/flags` - Downloads flag configurations
- Management APIs for experiments, flags, deployments, holdouts, and mutex groups

### SDK Implementation Patterns
Most Amplitude SDKs implement these core methods:
- **initialize** - Set up the client with configuration options
- **track/logEvent** - Record user actions
- **identify** - Associate user properties
- **setUserId/setDeviceId** - Manage user identity

### Experiment SDK Methods
- **fetch/fetchV2** - Retrieve flag variants for a user
- **evaluate/evaluateV2** - Evaluate flag variants locally
- **variant** - Get a specific flag variant for a user
- **exposure/track** - Record exposure events for accurate experiment analysis
