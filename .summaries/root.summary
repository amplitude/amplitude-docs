Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform integrates multiple product areas including Analytics, Experiment (A/B testing), Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP) into a unified ecosystem.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem is built around a unified data foundation that connects multiple product areas:

**Analytics Core** serves as the central hub, providing event tracking, user segmentation, and behavioral analysis through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Cohort Analysis, and specialized charts like Compass (North Star metrics), Personas (user clustering), and Revenue LTV analysis.

**Experimentation Platform** (Amplitude Experiment) integrates with analytics data to enable feature flagging, A/B testing, and advanced experimentation techniques. It includes experiment theory, workflow management, results analysis, and troubleshooting capabilities with dedicated SDKs and APIs.

**Data Infrastructure** encompasses the Customer Data Platform with source and destination catalogs, audience management, data tables, warehouse-native capabilities, and PII handling. The platform supports extensive integrations through partner ecosystems and maintains data governance through taxonomy management.

**User Experience Tools** include Session Replay for user interaction recording, Guides and Surveys for in-product messaging and feedback collection, and Web Experiment for client-side testing.

**Developer Ecosystem** provides comprehensive SDKs across platforms (Android, iOS, Browser, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, Unreal) along with Ampli for type-safe analytics implementation and extensive API coverage.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Analytics Concepts:**
- **Events**: User actions tracked within applications (page views, clicks, purchases)
- **Properties**: Attributes associated with events (event properties) or users (user properties)
- **Amplitude ID**: Platform-generated unique user identifier
- **User ID**: Customer-defined user identifier for cross-device tracking
- **Cohorts**: User segments based on behavioral criteria or properties
- **Funnels**: Sequential event analysis to measure conversion rates
- **Retention**: Analysis of user return behavior over time periods

**Experimentation Terminology:**
- **Feature Flags**: Boolean toggles for feature activation/deactivation
- **Variants**: Different versions of features being tested
- **Allocation**: Percentage of users exposed to experiments
- **Statistical Significance**: Confidence level in experiment results
- **Lift**: Percentage improvement in key metrics

**Data Management:**
- **Sources**: Data input connections (SDKs, APIs, third-party integrations)
- **Destinations**: Data output connections (warehouses, marketing tools, analytics platforms)
- **Taxonomy**: Standardized event and property schema management
- **Lookup Tables**: CSV-based data enrichment for event properties
- **Audiences**: Exportable user segments for activation in external tools

**Technical Infrastructure:**
- **Mount Points**: Content management system references for documentation organization
- **Propagation**: Multi-site content distribution settings
- **Route Patterns**: URL structure definitions for documentation sections
- **Injection Parameters**: Metadata for navigation and branding context

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude operates within a comprehensive product analytics ecosystem with several integration layers:

**Plan-Based Feature Access** determines functionality availability - Growth, Plus, Enterprise, and specialized add-ons (Accounts for B2B analytics, Portfolio for multi-project management, Activation for user profile access).

**Multi-Regional Architecture** supports data residency requirements with US and EU data centers, ensuring compliance with regional privacy regulations like GDPR.

**Partner Ecosystem** includes extensive source integrations (data collection tools, CDPs, databases) and destination integrations (marketing automation, business intelligence, data warehouses) through a comprehensive catalog system.

**Enterprise Features** encompass single sign-on (SSO), SCIM provisioning, advanced taxonomy management, behavioral cohorts, and enhanced security controls for large-scale deployments.
