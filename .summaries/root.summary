Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, conduct feature experiments, and optimize product experiences through data-driven insights. The platform integrates behavioral analytics, A/B testing, customer data management, and user engagement tools into a unified ecosystem.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Amplitude ecosystem operates across four core product areas with deep interconnections:

**Analytics Core:**
- **Analytics** serves as the primary behavioral analytics platform featuring 13 chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, Cohort Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Revenue LTV, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Personas, and Data Tables
- **Session Replay** provides qualitative user session recording capabilities that complement quantitative analytics
- **Charts** offers a comprehensive visualization suite supporting both current and legacy implementations
- **Compass** delivers automated insights and anomaly detection

**Experimentation Platform:**
- **Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing with advanced statistical techniques, workflow management, and results analysis
- **Web Experiment** enables browser-based experimentation tools
- **Experiment Results** offers dedicated analytics for measuring experiment performance and statistical significance

**Data Infrastructure:**
- **CDP (Customer Data Platform)** centralizes data management with extensive source and destination catalogs
- **Audiences** enables sophisticated user segmentation and targeting
- **Data Tables** provides structured data analysis and reporting capabilities
- **Warehouse-native Amplitude** allows direct data warehouse integration
- **Sources and Destinations** support an extensive integration ecosystem with taxonomized categories

**Developer Tools:**
- **SDKs** provide comprehensive instrumentation libraries across platforms (iOS, Android, Browser, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, Unreal)
- **Ampli** offers type-safe analytics implementation with code generation from tracking plans
- **APIs** expose REST endpoints for Analytics, Experiment, and Guides and Surveys functionality

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Analytics Concepts:**
- **Events** - Discrete user actions tracked within applications (clicks, page views, purchases, custom actions)
- **Properties** - Attributes associated with events and users enabling segmentation and analysis
- **Cohorts** - User groups defined by shared characteristics, behaviors, or time-based criteria
- **Funnels** - Sequential event analysis for measuring conversion rates and identifying drop-off points
- **Retention** - Analysis of user return behavior over specified time periods
- **Segmentation** - Event volume and property analysis across different user groups
- **Journeys** - User path analysis showing navigation patterns through applications

**Experimentation Terms:**
- **Feature Flags** - Runtime configuration controls enabling dynamic feature rollouts and targeting
- **Variants** - Different versions of features or experiences tested within experiments
- **Allocation** - User assignment methodology to experiment groups and control conditions
- **Statistical Significance** - Confidence levels and p-values for validating experiment results
- **Lift** - Quantified performance improvements measured between experiment variants
- **Holdout Groups** - Control populations excluded from feature exposure for impact measurement

**Data Management:**
- **Tracking Plan** - Structured schema defining events, properties, and implementation requirements
- **Taxonomy** - Organized categorization system for events and properties ensuring consistency
- **Governance** - Data quality controls, compliance management, and access policies
- **Instrumentation** - Code implementation patterns for data collection across platforms
- **Transformations** - Data processing rules for enrichment, filtering, and standardization

**Technical Infrastructure:**
- **Mount Points** - Content management system references using UUID identifiers for documentation organization
- **Collections** - Grouped content areas with shared routing, navigation, and metadata
- **Injection** - Automated metadata insertion for navigation structure and branding consistency
- **Propagation** - Multi-site content distribution with localization support

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The platform demonstrates sophisticated cross-product integration:

**Multi-Product Workflows:**
- Experiment results automatically populate Analytics charts for comprehensive performance analysis
- Audience segments created in Analytics can be directly applied for Experiment targeting and feature rollouts
- Session Replay provides qualitative context for quantitative patterns identified in Analytics
- CDP data simultaneously feeds Analytics event streams and Experiment user properties
- Cohorts defined in Analytics can trigger automated actions through destination integrations

**Cross-Platform Consistency:**
- Unified SDK architecture maintains consistent implementation patterns across mobile, web, and server-side environments
- Shared API design principles across Analytics (`/apis/analytics/{slug}`), Experiment (`/apis/experiment/{slug}`), and Guides and Surveys (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/{slug}`)
- Common identity resolution and user property systems ensuring data consistency
- Standardized data governance and privacy controls applied across all products

**Enterprise Integration:**
- Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication spanning all platform products with role-based access controls
- Unified billing and usage management with granular product-level tracking
- Account management hierarchy supporting organization, project, and team structures
- Partner ecosystem with pre-built integrations and webhook support for custom workflows
