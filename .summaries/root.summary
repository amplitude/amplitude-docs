Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides product teams with tools to understand user behavior, optimize experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of several interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP), all unified under a cohesive ecosystem designed for modern product development workflows.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Amplitude platform is built around several core products that integrate seamlessly:

**Analytics Core**: The foundational analytics engine provides event tracking, user segmentation, and behavioral analysis through multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, Revenue LTV, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, and Experiment Results. These charts work together to provide comprehensive user behavior insights.

**Experimentation Platform**: Amplitude Experiment enables feature flagging, A/B testing, and advanced experimentation techniques. It includes experiment theory, workflow management, advanced techniques, troubleshooting tools, and "under the hood" technical implementation details. The platform supports both client-side and server-side experiments with statistical analysis capabilities.

**Data Infrastructure**: The CDP handles data ingestion, transformation, and activation through source and destination catalogs. It includes audience management, data tables, warehouse-native capabilities, and PII handling integrations. The platform supports real-time data processing and cross-platform user identity resolution.

**User Experience Tools**: Session Replay provides visual user session recordings, while Guides and Surveys enables in-product user engagement through interactive guides, surveys, and resource centers for onboarding and feedback collection.

**Developer Ecosystem**: Comprehensive SDK support across platforms (Android, iOS, Browser, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, Unreal) and the Ampli code generation tool for type-safe analytics implementation.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events and Properties**: The fundamental data model consists of events (user actions) and properties (contextual data). Events are tracked through SDKs and processed through the analytics pipeline.

**Charts and Visualizations**: Different analysis types including segmentation (breaking down events by properties), funnels (conversion analysis), retention (user return behavior), and cohorts (user groupings based on shared characteristics).

**Experiments and Variants**: Feature experiments with control and treatment groups, using statistical significance testing and confidence intervals for decision-making.

**Flags and Deployments**: Feature flags for controlling feature rollouts, with deployment strategies including percentage rollouts, user targeting, and gradual releases.

**Sources and Destinations**: Data integration points where sources bring data into Amplitude (SDKs, APIs, third-party tools) and destinations send data out to other platforms.

**Audiences and Cohorts**: User segments based on behavioral criteria, demographic data, or custom properties that can be used for targeting and personalization.

**Sessions and Users**: User identification and session management across devices and platforms, with identity resolution and user property management.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates with the modern product development stack through multiple touchpoints:

**Analytics Integration**: The platform connects with popular tools through the destination catalog, enabling data activation in marketing platforms, customer success tools, and business intelligence systems. The Analytics API (`/apis/analytics/`) provides programmatic access to data and insights.

**Development Workflow**: SDKs integrate with CI/CD pipelines, while Ampli generates type-safe tracking code that integrates with development workflows. The platform supports both client-side and server-side implementation patterns.

**Experimentation Ecosystem**: Experiment SDKs (`/sdks/experiment-sdks/`) enable feature flag evaluation across platforms, with APIs for experiment management and results analysis. Integration with deployment tools enables automated experiment lifecycle management.

**Data Ecosystem**: The CDP connects with data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift), enabling warehouse-native analytics and reverse ETL capabilities. Source catalog integrations bring data from CRMs, marketing tools, and product platforms.

**Enterprise Integration**: Single sign-on (SSO) support, account management tools, billing and usage monitoring, and administrative controls enable enterprise deployment and governance.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Analytics APIs**: 
- `/apis/analytics/` - Core analytics data access and query endpoints
- Event ingestion APIs for real-time data collection
- Cohort and audience management APIs

**Experiment APIs**:
- `/apis/experiment/` - Feature flag evaluation and experiment management
- Flag configuration and targeting APIs
- Results and statistical analysis endpoints

**Guides and Surveys API**:
- `/apis/guides-and-surveys/` - In-product experience management
- Content delivery and user interaction tracking

**SDK Implementation Patterns**:

The platform operates on a multi-tenant architecture with data residency options (US/EU), enterprise security controls, and scalable infrastructure designed to handle high-volume event processing. Navigation is organized around user roles (developers, analysts, administrators) with permission-based access to different product areas and functionality levels.
