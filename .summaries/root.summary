Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products: Analytics (behavioral analysis and visualization), Experiment (A/B testing and feature flagging), Session Replay (user session recording), Guides and Surveys (in-product messaging), and a Customer Data Platform (CDP) for unified customer profiles and data orchestration.

## Product Architecture and Core Components

### Analytics Platform
The Analytics core provides event tracking, user segmentation, and behavioral analysis through specialized chart types including Event Segmentation for basic metrics, Funnel Analysis for conversion tracking, Retention Analysis for user engagement, Cohort Analysis through Lifecycle charts, User Journey mapping via Journeys, Revenue LTV for monetization analysis, and advanced visualizations like Compass (KPI monitoring), Stickiness, Impact Analysis, and Engagement Matrix.

Data ingestion occurs through multiple channels: Analytics SDKs for Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal platforms, server-side APIs, and third-party integrations via Source and Destination Catalogs.

### Experimentation Platform (Amplitude Experiment)
A comprehensive A/B testing and feature flagging solution encompassing experiment design with statistical rigor, feature management through flag-based rollouts with targeting capabilities, results analysis with statistical significance testing, and advanced techniques including multi-armed bandits and sequential testing.

### Customer Data Platform (CDP)
Provides unified customer profiles through dynamic Audiences (user segmentation based on behavioral and demographic criteria), unified data source ingestion, audience activation across marketing and product tools via Destinations, and warehouse-native architecture for direct cloud data warehouse integration.

### Additional Products
Session Replay captures user session recordings for UX optimization, Guides and Surveys enable in-product messaging and feedback collection, and Agents provide AI-powered analytics assistance and automated insights generation.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Core Analytics Concepts
**Events** are discrete user actions tracked with properties and timestamps. **User Properties** represent persistent attributes associated with individual users, while **Event Properties** contain contextual data specific to individual event occurrences. **Cohorts/Audiences** are dynamic user segments based on behavioral or demographic criteria. **Funnels** measure conversion rates through sequential event flows. **Retention** tracks user return behavior over specified time periods. **LTV (Lifetime Value)** calculates revenue attribution and customer value.

### Experimentation Terminology
**Feature Flags** are boolean toggles controlling feature availability. **Variants** represent different versions of features being tested. **Allocation** defines the percentage of users exposed to experiments. **Statistical Significance** indicates confidence level in experiment results. **Lift** measures percentage improvement in key metrics.

### Data Management
**Tracking Plan** defines schema for events and properties via Amplitude Data. **Taxonomy** establishes standardized naming conventions. **Governance** implements data quality controls and validation rules. **Instrumentation** refers to code implementation for event tracking.

### Technical Infrastructure
**SDKs (Software Development Kits)** are client libraries for event tracking. **APIs** enable server-to-server integration. **Ampli** is a code generation tool for type-safe event tracking. **Server Zones** provide data residency options (US/EU). **Real-time vs Batch** describes event processing and delivery modes.

## API Endpoints and Integration Methods

### Analytics APIs
The **HTTP V2 API** (`/2/httpapi`) serves as the modern event ingestion endpoint for real-time tracking. The **Batch API** handles bulk event uploads for historical data import. The **Export API** enables raw event data extraction with S3/GCS integration. The **Dashboard REST API** provides programmatic access to chart data and configurations. The **Cohort API** manages audience definition and membership.

### Experiment APIs
The **Evaluation API** provides real-time feature flag and experiment variant resolution. The **Management API** handles experiment configuration and flag management. The **Results API** delivers statistical results and performance metrics access.

### SDK Integration Patterns
Client-side SDKs utilize patterns like `amplitude.init()`, `amplitude.track()`, and `amplitude.identify()`. Server-side SDKs follow similar patterns with additional configuration for API keys and batching. Ampli Generated Code uses `ampli.load()`, `ampli.track.eventName()`, and `ampli.identify()`.

### Common CLI Commands
The Ampli workflow includes `ampli pull` (download tracking plan) and `ampli status` (validate implementation). SDK installation uses platform-specific package managers like `npm install @amplitude/analytics-browser`.

## Ecosystem Integration and Relationships

### Data Flow Architecture
The platform operates on a hub-and-spoke model with Analytics as the central data repository. Events flow from multiple sources through standardized SDKs and APIs into the Analytics core, where they're processed for real-time dashboards and batch analysis. This central repository feeds insights to Experiment for targeting and results analysis, Session Replay for behavioral context, and CDP for audience activation.

### Cross-Product Integration
Analytics and Experiment integrate through experiment results appearing as specialized chart types, with Analytics events used for experiment assignment and outcome measurement. Analytics and CDP combine behavioral data for audience segmentation while audiences enable targeted analysis. Session Replay provides qualitative context for quantitative Analytics metrics. Guides and Surveys campaigns are tracked as events with response analysis flowing back to Analytics.

### Third-Party Ecosystem
The platform connects with marketing tools (Google Ads, Facebook, Salesforce), data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift), and development workflows through comprehensive source and destination catalogs. Warehouse-native capabilities enable direct SQL querying of Amplitude data within existing data infrastructure.

### Administrative and Governance
Organization-level features include Single Sign-On (SSO) integration, role-based access control, billing management, account administration, and data governance tools. Enterprise requirements are supported through SOC 2 compliance, GDPR controls, and configurable data retention policies.

The platform architecture supports different user personas (developers, analysts, product managers, administrators) with clear migration paths between legacy and modern implementations, comprehensive troubleshooting resources, and specialized documentation for each product component while maintaining integration consistency across the entire ecosystem.
