Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides behavioral analytics, feature experimentation, customer data management, and user engagement tools. The platform enables organizations to track user behavior, run A/B tests, manage customer data pipelines, and create personalized user experiences across web and mobile applications.

## Core Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem consists of four primary product areas that work together to provide end-to-end customer analytics and engagement capabilities:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational behavioral analytics platform, offering multiple chart types for data visualization including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Cohort Analysis (Stickiness), Lifecycle charts, Journeys, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, Revenue LTV, and Experiment Results. These charts enable comprehensive user behavior analysis from basic event tracking to advanced behavioral cohort creation.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flag management and A/B testing capabilities, integrating closely with Analytics for experiment analysis. The platform includes advanced statistical techniques, experiment theory foundations, workflow management, and troubleshooting tools. Experiment results are visualized through dedicated chart types within the Analytics platform.

**Amplitude CDP (Customer Data Platform)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation through Sources, Destinations, Audiences, and warehouse-native capabilities. The CDP connects to Analytics for behavioral data collection and to Experiment for audience targeting in feature tests.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user session recordings, providing qualitative insights that complement the quantitative data from Analytics and inform experiment hypotheses in Amplitude Experiment.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Amplitude ID**: The primary user identifier that tracks users across sessions and devices, essential for user journey analysis and cohort creation.

**Events and Properties**: Events represent user actions (clicks, page views, purchases) while properties provide contextual information about events (device type, location, custom attributes).

**Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments based on behavioral criteria that can be created in Analytics and used across Experiment for targeting and CDP for data activation.

**Feature Flags**: Boolean toggles that control feature visibility and behavior, managed through Amplitude Experiment with targeting rules based on user properties and cohorts.

**Ampli**: Amplitude's type-safe analytics wrapper that provides strongly-typed event tracking across multiple programming languages and platforms.

**Behavioral Cohorts**: User segments defined by specific actions, properties, or engagement patterns that update dynamically as user behavior changes.

**Experiment Variants**: Different versions of features or experiences served to users in A/B tests, with statistical analysis provided through Amplitude's experimentation engine.

**Data Taxonomy**: The structured organization of events, properties, and user attributes that ensures consistent data collection across teams and applications.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates with the broader marketing and product development ecosystem through several key mechanisms:

**SDK and API Ecosystem**: Comprehensive SDKs for Analytics (Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, Unreal) and Experiment SDKs for feature flag evaluation. APIs include Analytics API, Experiment APIs, and Guides and Surveys API for programmatic access.

**Data Integration Layer**: Source catalog for data ingestion from various platforms and Destination catalog for data activation across marketing, advertising, and customer engagement tools. The CDP supports both real-time event streaming and batch cohort syncing.

**Framework Integrations**: Native integrations with popular development frameworks to simplify implementation and ensure consistent data collection patterns.

**Partner Ecosystem**: Extensive partner integrations for specialized use cases including marketing automation, customer support, and business intelligence platforms.

## Administrative and Operational Framework

**Account Management**: Comprehensive user management, permissions, and organizational controls for enterprise deployments.

**Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Enterprise authentication integration supporting SAML and OAuth providers for secure access management.

**Billing and Usage Management**: Transparent usage tracking and billing controls for managing platform costs across different product areas.

**Data Governance**: PII integrations and data privacy controls to ensure compliance with regulations like GDPR and CCPA.

## Technical Implementation Patterns

**Route Structure**: The platform uses hierarchical URL routing patterns:
- `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/{slug}` for analytics features
- `/feature-experiment/{category}/{slug}` for experimentation features  
- `/data/{category}/{slug}` for CDP functionality
- `/sdks/{platform}/{slug}` for SDK documentation
- `/apis/{product}/{slug}` for API references

**Multi-language Support**: International support including Japanese translations and localized content delivery.

**Content Management**: Structured content organization using YAML-based collections with mounting capabilities for hierarchical documentation organization.

## Specialized Product Extensions

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys**: In-app messaging and user feedback collection tools that integrate with Analytics for targeting and measurement.

**Web Experiment**: Browser-based experimentation capabilities for client-side A/B testing without requiring server-side implementation.

**Warehouse-Native Amplitude**: Direct integration with cloud data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift) enabling analytics on existing data infrastructure.

**Legacy Chart Support**: Backward compatibility for deprecated chart types while transitioning users to newer analytics capabilities.

The platform provides extensive troubleshooting resources, migration guides, and educational content through the Academy to support implementation and ongoing optimization. The interconnected nature of these products creates a comprehensive platform where behavioral insights from Analytics inform experiment design in Experiment, which then feeds back into Analytics for results analysis, while the CDP ensures data flows seamlessly between Amplitude and the broader technology stack.
