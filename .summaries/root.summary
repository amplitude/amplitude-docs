# Amplitude Product Analytics and Experimentation Platform

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Core Product Architecture

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, providing 16 specialized chart types organized into strategic categories for user understanding, conversion analysis, retention tracking, and advanced behavioral insights. The platform processes event data through a sophisticated property system supporting user properties, event properties, and complex filtering mechanisms.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with statistical analysis, advanced targeting, and experiment result visualization. The platform includes experiment theory documentation, advanced techniques, workflow management, and comprehensive troubleshooting resources.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user session recordings to provide qualitative insights into user behavior and experience optimization opportunities.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user engagement through targeted messaging, onboarding flows, and feedback collection mechanisms.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation across the entire customer data ecosystem with source and destination catalogs, audience management, and warehouse-native capabilities.

## Analytics Chart Types and Capabilities

The analytics platform provides specialized visualization tools across four strategic domains:

**User Understanding**: Event Segmentation for behavior pattern analysis, Data Tables for multi-metric comparisons, User Sessions for engagement tracking, and real-time Event Explorer for instrumentation validation.

**Conversion Analysis**: Funnel Analysis for multi-step conversion tracking, Journeys for sequential path analysis, and Experiment Results for statistical significance testing.

**Retention and Engagement**: Retention Analysis for cohort tracking, Lifecycle for user categorization (New, Current, Resurrected, Dormant), Stickiness for frequency analysis, and Engagement Matrix for feature adoption measurement.

**Advanced Analytics**: Machine learning-powered Personas for behavioral clustering, Impact Analysis for feature interaction measurement, Compass for retention threshold identification, and Revenue LTV for monetization analysis.

## SDK and Integration Ecosystem

The platform supports comprehensive instrumentation through multiple SDK categories:

**Analytics SDKs**: Native implementations for Android, iOS, Browser (JavaScript), React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal, Node.js, Python, Java, and Go, each providing platform-specific event tracking, user identification, and property management.

**Experiment SDKs**: Dedicated SDKs for feature flag evaluation and experiment participation across all major platforms and frameworks.

**Ampli**: Type-safe analytics implementation tool that generates strongly-typed tracking libraries from centralized tracking plans, ensuring data quality and developer experience consistency.

## API Infrastructure

**Analytics API**: RESTful endpoints for event ingestion, user property management, and data export with rate limiting and authentication mechanisms.

**Experiment APIs**: Management and evaluation APIs for feature flags, experiment configuration, and result retrieval.

**Guides and Surveys API**: Programmatic control over in-product messaging and survey deployment.

The APIs support both real-time and batch data operations with comprehensive authentication, error handling, and webhook capabilities.

## Data Management and Integration

**Source Catalog**: Pre-built integrations for data ingestion from marketing platforms, customer support tools, payment processors, and other business systems, categorized by integration type with standardized configuration workflows.

**Destination Catalog**: Data activation integrations for marketing automation, customer engagement platforms, data warehouses, and business intelligence tools, enabling closed-loop analytics and personalization.

**Audiences**: Dynamic user segmentation based on behavioral criteria, demographic properties, and engagement patterns, with real-time updates and cross-platform activation.

**Warehouse-Native Amplitude**: Direct integration with cloud data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift) for analysis without data movement, supporting existing data infrastructure investments.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events**: User actions or system occurrences tracked within applications, including default Amplitude events (Top Global Events, Any Active Event, New User) and custom events with property attachments.

**Properties**: Metadata associated with events (event properties) or users (user properties) that enable segmentation, filtering, and analysis. Supports complex data types including arrays and objects.

**Cohorts**: User segments defined by behavioral criteria, demographic attributes, or engagement patterns, used for targeted analysis and experiment assignment.

**Experiments**: A/B tests or multivariate tests with statistical analysis, targeting rules, and performance measurement against defined success metrics.

**Feature Flags**: Boolean or multivariate configuration controls that enable gradual feature rollouts, targeted feature access, and operational safety mechanisms.

**Sampling**: Performance optimization technique using statistical sampling (typically 10%) with inverse scaling to maintain analytical accuracy while reducing computational overhead.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management**: User provisioning, role-based access control, team organization, and permission management across projects and data access levels.

**Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Enterprise authentication integration supporting SAML, OAuth, and other identity provider protocols for centralized access control.

**Billing and Usage**: Consumption tracking, plan management, and usage optimization tools for cost control and resource allocation.

**Migration Tools**: Data import utilities, platform migration assistance, and configuration transfer capabilities for onboarding from other analytics platforms.

## Specialized Features and Advanced Capabilities

**PII Integrations**: Privacy-compliant data handling with personally identifiable information management, data residency controls, and compliance framework support.

**Partners**: Third-party integration ecosystem including technology partners, implementation partners, and certified solution providers.

**Academy Content**: Educational resources, best practices documentation, and certification programs for platform proficiency development.

**Troubleshooting and FAQ**: Comprehensive support documentation covering common implementation challenges, debugging techniques, and platform optimization strategies.

The platform operates with multi-site support (English and Japanese localization), revision control for configuration management, and preview capabilities for content validation before publication. Route structures follow RESTful conventions with hierarchical organization reflecting product relationships and user workflow patterns.
