Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of several interconnected products delivering end-to-end analytics, experimentation, and user engagement capabilities.

## Core Product Architecture

The Amplitude ecosystem centers around four primary products that integrate seamlessly:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, providing event tracking, user segmentation, and behavioral analysis through 12 specialized chart types: Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Revenue LTV, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, and Experiment Results. These charts enable comprehensive analysis of user behavior patterns, conversion optimization, retention metrics, and revenue attribution.

**Amplitude Experiment** functions as the feature flagging and A/B testing platform, enabling controlled experiments, feature rollout management, and user experience optimization through statistical analysis. It includes advanced experimentation techniques, workflow management, and comprehensive troubleshooting capabilities.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user sessions to provide visual insights into user interactions, helping identify usability issues and optimization opportunities through recorded user behavior.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** delivers in-product user engagement through contextual onboarding experiences, feedback collection systems, and integrated help functionality directly within applications.

## Data Infrastructure and Customer Data Platform (CDP)

Amplitude's CDP capabilities provide comprehensive data management through Sources and Destinations architecture. The **Source Catalog** enables data ingestion from various platforms, while the **Destination Catalog** facilitates data activation across marketing, analytics, and operational tools. The platform supports **Audiences** for user segmentation and targeting, with **Warehouse-native Amplitude** providing direct data warehouse integration for organizations with existing data infrastructure.

**PII Integrations** handle personally identifiable information securely, ensuring privacy regulation compliance while maintaining analytical capabilities. The CDP enables bidirectional data flow, allowing organizations to both collect behavioral data and activate insights across their technology stack.

## SDK and API Ecosystem

Amplitude provides extensive instrumentation capabilities through platform-specific SDKs and APIs:

**Analytics SDKs** include implementations for Android, iOS, Browser (JavaScript), React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal, Node.js, Python, Java, and Go. Each SDK provides comprehensive event tracking, user identification, and configuration options tailored to specific development environments.

**Experiment SDKs** enable feature flag evaluation and experiment participation across all supported platforms, with consistent APIs for flag resolution, user targeting, and experiment exposure tracking.

**Ampli** represents Amplitude's type-safe analytics wrapper that generates strongly-typed tracking libraries based on predefined event schemas, ensuring data quality and consistency across development teams while reducing implementation errors.

## Key API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

The platform exposes several critical API endpoints:
- `/apis/analytics/` - Event ingestion and query APIs for server-side data collection
- `/apis/experiment/` - Feature flag and experiment management APIs
- `/apis/guides-and-surveys/` - In-product experience management APIs
- `/sdks/analytics/` - SDK documentation and configuration resources
- `/sdks/experiment-sdks/` - Experiment SDK implementation guides
- `/sdks/ampli/` - Type-safe analytics implementation documentation

Documentation follows structured routing patterns like `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/{slug}` for analytics content and `/feature-experiment/{slug}` for experiment-related resources.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** represent user actions tracked within applications (clicks, page views, purchases, custom interactions). **Properties** are attributes associated with events or users providing analytical context. **Cohorts** define user segments based on shared characteristics or behaviors.

**Funnels** analyze sequential user journeys showing conversion rates between steps. **Retention** measures user return behavior over specified time periods. **Amplitude Query Language (AQL)** provides SQL-like querying capabilities for advanced analytics.

**Feature Flags** are boolean toggles controlling feature availability for different user segments. **Experiments** represent controlled tests comparing different user experiences or features. **Variants** are different versions of features being tested, while **Exposure** occurs when users encounter experiments or feature flags.

**Bucketing** assigns users to experiment variants or feature flag states. **Instrumentation** refers to tracking code implementation for capturing user events. **Schema** defines structured formats for events and properties ensuring data consistency.

## Chart Types and Analytics Capabilities

Amplitude provides specialized analytical chart types:

- **Event Segmentation** measures event frequency and user engagement patterns
- **Funnel Analysis** tracks conversion rates through multi-step user journeys
- **Retention Analysis** analyzes user return behavior and long-term engagement
- **User Sessions** examines session-based metrics and activity patterns
- **Journeys** visualizes user paths and behavioral flows
- **Lifecycle** categorizes users by engagement levels (new, current, dormant, resurrected)
- **Stickiness** measures user engagement frequency over time
- **Revenue LTV** analyzes customer lifetime value and revenue attribution
- **Personas** creates behavioral user segments based on action patterns
- **Compass** provides metric correlation analysis and anomaly detection
- **Impact Analysis** measures product change effects on key metrics

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

The platform includes comprehensive **Account Management** with **Single Sign-on** integration supporting enterprise identity providers. **Billing and Use** management provides usage monitoring and cost optimization for large-scale implementations.

Administrative capabilities support multi-site deployments with localization features, including **Japanese Translation** support and granular permission management across user roles and access levels.

## Integration Ecosystem and Migration

Amplitude integrates with numerous third-party platforms through its **Partners** program, enabling data flow between analytics, marketing, product, and operational tools. The **Destination Catalog** and **Source Catalog** provide pre-built integrations across the modern data stack.

**Migration** tools support organizations transitioning from other analytics platforms, with guidance for data mapping, historical data import, and implementation best practices. **Legacy Charts** documentation maintains backward compatibility for existing implementations.

## Developer Resources

The platform provides **Get Started** documentation, **FAQ and Troubleshooting** resources, and **Academy Content** for user education. **Workflow** documentation offers implementation guidance for different use cases, while **Under the Hood** technical documentation explains platform architecture and advanced configuration options.

This comprehensive platform enables organizations to implement sophisticated product analytics, run controlled experiments, and optimize user experiences through data-driven insights while maintaining enterprise-grade security, compliance, and scalability requirements across web, mobile, and server-side implementations.
