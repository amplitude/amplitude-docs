Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products: Analytics (foundational behavioral analysis), Experiment (feature flagging and A/B testing), Session Replay (user session recording), Guides and Surveys (in-product engagement), and a Customer Data Platform (data management and activation).

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the core foundation, providing event tracking, user segmentation, and behavioral analysis through 13 chart types: Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, Revenue LTV, and Experiment Results. The platform supports both current and legacy chart implementations with extensive customization capabilities.

**Amplitude Experiment** integrates deeply with Analytics for A/B testing and feature flagging, providing experiment analysis, advanced statistical techniques, workflow management, and comprehensive troubleshooting. It operates through client-side and server-side SDKs with dedicated management APIs.

**Session Replay** provides qualitative context to quantitative analytics by recording actual user interactions, enabling teams to identify friction points and understand user behavior patterns beyond metrics.

**Guides and Surveys** closes the feedback loop by enabling contextual in-product engagement, onboarding flows, and user feedback collection based on behavioral insights from Analytics.

**Customer Data Platform** manages the entire data lifecycle through source/destination catalogs, audience management, warehouse-native capabilities, PII integrations, and data governance features.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Analytics Core Concepts:**
- **Events** - Tracked user actions (page views, clicks, purchases)
- **Properties** - Event and user attributes for segmentation
- **Cohorts** - Behavioral or demographic user segments
- **Funnels** - Sequential conversion analysis
- **Retention** - User return behavior measurement
- **Amplitude IDs** - Unique identifiers (deviceId, userId, sessionId)

**Experimentation Terms:**
- **Feature Flags** - Boolean feature toggles
- **Variants** - Different feature versions in tests
- **Allocation** - User exposure percentages
- **Statistical Significance** - Result confidence levels
- **Lift** - Percentage metric improvements

**Data Management:**
- **Sources** - Data ingestion endpoints
- **Destinations** - External data activation points
- **Transformations** - Data processing rules
- **Taxonomy** - Standardized naming conventions
- **Tracking Plans** - Event implementation specifications

## SDK and API Ecosystem

**Analytics SDKs** support Browser (JavaScript/TypeScript), iOS (Swift), Android (Kotlin/Java), React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine with core event tracking, user identification, and revenue logging capabilities.

**Experiment SDKs** provide feature flagging across web, mobile, and server environments with real-time flag evaluation and user targeting.

**Ampli Code Generation** creates type-safe wrappers from tracking plans across multiple languages, ensuring implementation consistency and reducing tracking errors.

**Primary API Endpoints:**
- `/analytics/` - Event ingestion and data retrieval
- `/apis/experiment/` - Flag management and evaluation  
- `/apis/guides-and-surveys/` - In-product experience management
- Chart-specific APIs for visualization and analysis

## Enterprise and Administrative Features

**Account Management** includes user provisioning, role-based access control, and organization settings with SSO integration supporting SAML and OAuth protocols.

**Billing and Usage** management provides consumption monitoring, plan management, and cost optimization across all products.

**Migration Tools** facilitate platform transitions with data import utilities and SDK upgrade guides.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The platform operates as a unified ecosystem where Analytics data informs Experiment decisions, Session Replay provides qualitative context to quantitative insights, and Guides/Surveys enable behavioral pattern-based user engagement. The CDP ensures data consistency across all products while enabling activation in external systems.

**Developer Support** includes Academy educational content, comprehensive FAQ/troubleshooting documentation, partner integrations with marketing and BI tools, and multi-language support including Japanese localization.

**Partners Integration** provides pre-built connectors extending Amplitude's capabilities within existing technology stacks, enabling seamless data flow between Amplitude and popular business tools.

This integrated approach allows organizations to close the loop between user understanding and product optimization, creating a continuous cycle of measurement, experimentation, and improvement driven by comprehensive behavioral analytics.
