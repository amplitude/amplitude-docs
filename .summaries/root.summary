# Amplitude Product Documentation Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform designed to help organizations understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and make data-driven decisions. The platform enables tracking of user interactions, analysis of behavioral patterns, execution of experiments, and visualization of user sessions to improve digital products. Amplitude's core value proposition lies in connecting user behavior data to business outcomes through its analytics and experimentation capabilities.

## Product Relationships and Features

Amplitude's product suite consists of four main interconnected components:

1. **Analytics** - The foundation of the platform that processes and visualizes user behavior data through specialized chart types:
   - Event Segmentation for analyzing specific user actions
   - Funnel Analysis for understanding conversion paths
   - Retention Analysis for measuring user engagement over time
   - User Sessions for analyzing complete user journeys
   - Impact Analysis for measuring feature effects
   - Journeys for visualizing user paths through products
   - Personas for user segmentation and behavioral profiling
   - Stickiness for measuring feature engagement frequency
   - Revenue LTV for customer lifetime value analysis
   - Engagement Matrix for comparing feature usage
   - Compass for discovering behavioral correlations

2. **Experiment** - An integrated experimentation platform with:
   - Feature flag management for controlled rollouts
   - A/B testing capabilities with statistical rigor
   - Sequential testing methodology
   - Targeting and segmentation tools
   - Mutual exclusion groups to prevent experiment interference

3. **Session Replay** - Visual recording of user sessions that provides:
   - Qualitative insights into user behavior
   - Visual context for quantitative analytics data
   - Troubleshooting capabilities for user experience issues

4. **Data Management** - Infrastructure for data collection and distribution:
   - Sources for data ingestion from various platforms
   - Source Catalog of pre-built integrations
   - Destinations for exporting data to other tools
   - Destination Catalog of supported export targets
   - Audiences for user segmentation and activation
   - PII Integrations for sensitive data handling
   - CDP (Customer Data Platform) capabilities

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Analytics Terminology
- **Events**: Discrete user actions tracked in the system (e.g., "Button Click", "Page View")
- **Event Properties**: Contextual attributes attached to events providing additional details
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes associated with user profiles
- **Cohorts**: Defined segments of users based on behavior or attributes
- **MTU**: Monthly Tracked Users, the primary billing metric in Amplitude
- **Active Users**: Users who have triggered at least one event in a given time period
- **Behavioral Cohorts**: User segments defined by specific action patterns

### Experiment Terminology
- **Feature Flags**: Toggles that control feature visibility and behavior
- **Variants**: Different versions of a feature being tested
- **Sequential Testing**: Statistical methodology that allows continuous monitoring without inflating false positives
- **Targeting Rules**: Conditions that determine which users see which variants
- **Mutual Exclusion Groups**: Mechanism to ensure users only participate in one experiment from a group

### Data Management Terminology
- **Source**: Origin point for data collection (website, mobile app, server)
- **Destination**: Target system for data export (data warehouse, marketing tool, etc.)
- **Warehouse-Native**: Direct data loading from data warehouses without API keys
- **Integration Category**: Classification system for data connectors (analytics, marketing, etc.)
- **Data Governance**: Rules and processes for managing data quality and privacy

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's products work together in an integrated ecosystem across four layers:

1. **Data Collection Layer**: SDKs and APIs capture user behavior data from various platforms
   - Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal, and server-side SDKs
   - Ampli code generation tool for type-safe instrumentation
   - Direct database and warehouse integrations

2. **Data Processing Layer**: Processes raw event data into analyzable formats
   - Real-time event processing
   - Identity resolution and user stitching
   - Data transformation and enrichment

3. **Analysis and Activation Layer**: Tools for deriving insights and taking action
   - Analytics dashboards and charts
   - Experiment configuration and results
   - Session Replay for qualitative analysis
   - Audience creation and export to activation tools

4. **Integration Layer**: Connects with external tools and platforms
   - Data warehouse integrations (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift)
   - Marketing tool connections (email, ads, CRM)
   - Product development tools (feature flag systems, product analytics)

## Technical Implementation

### API Endpoints
- Analytics Event Collection: `https://api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`
- Batch Event Upload: `https://api2.amplitude.com/batch`
- User Lookup: `https://amplitude.com/api/2/usersearch`
- Experiment Evaluation: `https://api.lab.amplitude.com/v1/vardata`
- Feature Flag Configuration: `https://api.lab.amplitude.com/v1/flags`

### SDK Implementation
All SDKs follow a similar initialization pattern:
```javascript
// Browser SDK example
amplitude.init('API_KEY', {
  userId: 'user@example.com',
  deviceId: 'device-id',
  logLevel: 4,
  flushIntervalMillis: 1000,
  optOut: false
});

// Track an event
amplitude.track('Button Clicked', {
  buttonColor: 'blue',
  buttonText: 'Submit'
});
```

### Command Line Tools
Amplitude provides CLI tools for certain operations:
```bash
# Ampli CLI for code generation
npx @amplitude/ampli pull
npx @amplitude/ampli status
npx @amplitude/ampli generate
```
