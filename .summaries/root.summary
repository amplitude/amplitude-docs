Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and customer data platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights and experimentation. The platform combines behavioral analytics, feature experimentation, customer data management, and AI-powered personalization into an integrated ecosystem.

## Core Product Suite and Architecture

Amplitude operates through four interconnected products that form a unified analytics and optimization platform:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, providing event-based tracking and visualization through specialized chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Pathfinder, and Journeys. The platform processes real-time behavioral data through sophisticated statistical analysis, cohort segmentation, and collaborative analytics workflows with advanced features like anomaly detection and conversational AI through "Ask Amplitude."

**Amplitude Data** functions as the data governance and instrumentation management system, ensuring data quality through centralized tracking plans, schema validation, and taxonomy management. It provides comprehensive data ingestion capabilities through multiple SDKs, APIs, and third-party integrations while maintaining enterprise-grade governance controls.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers A/B testing and feature flag management through deterministic user assignment algorithms and sophisticated statistical analysis using mSPRT (Mixture Sequential Probability Ratio Test). The platform supports both remote and local evaluation modes with global CDN infrastructure, enabling controlled experimentation at scale with advanced targeting and dependency management.

**Amplitude Activation** powers AI-driven personalization and user targeting through machine learning-based predictions, behavioral cohort generation, and automated recommendations. The system transforms user behavior data into actionable segments for marketing campaigns and personalized experiences using transformer-based sequence models and AutoML clustering algorithms.

## Data Architecture and Integration Ecosystem

The platform operates on an event-centric data model with immutable architecture using pre-aggregated time-series data sets. Core data processing handles multiple identification systems (Amplitude ID, Device ID, User ID) with sophisticated identity resolution and cross-device tracking capabilities.

**SDK and API Infrastructure** supports comprehensive instrumentation across Browser SDK 2.0, iOS Swift SDK, Android Kotlin SDK, React Native, Flutter, Unity, and server-side SDKs for Node.js, Python, Java, Go, and PHP. The HTTP V2 API provides real-time event ingestion while the Batch API handles bulk data processing with configurable rate limiting and throttling mechanisms.

**Third-Party Integration Ecosystem** encompasses over 100 destinations including marketing automation platforms (Braze, Iterable, HubSpot), advertising networks (Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads), data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift), and customer engagement tools (Intercom, Customer.io, OneSignal). The destination catalog supports real-time event streaming, cohort synchronization, and bulk data exports with sophisticated authentication and data validation.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Concepts

**Core Data Concepts:**
- **Events**: Tracked user actions with associated properties and timestamps
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes associated with user profiles
- **Event Properties**: Contextual attributes specific to individual events
- **Behavioral Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments based on behavioral criteria or predictive characteristics
- **Computed User Properties**: Transformed data points derived from events through aggregation, counting, or temporal calculations

**Analytics Terminology:**
- **Active Users**: Users performing at least one tracked event within specified time periods
- **Monthly Tracked Users (MTU)**: Primary billing metric for unique users per calendar month
- **Retention Analysis**: Measurement of user return behavior using weighted average calculations
- **Funnel Analysis**: Sequential conversion tracking with configurable time windows and attribution models
- **Session Tracking**: User interaction periods with configurable timeout windows (30-minute web, 5-minute mobile default)

**Experimentation Framework:**
- **Assignment Events**: Automatically tracked when users are assigned to experiment variants
- **Exposure Events**: Triggered when users interact with experimental treatments
- **Bucketing Salt**: Unique identifier combined with amplitude_id for deterministic randomization
- **Sequential Testing**: Statistical methodology enabling early experiment termination while maintaining validity
- **Flag Dependencies**: Hierarchical relationships controlling evaluation order and enabling complex experiment scenarios

**Data Management:**
- **Tracking Plans**: Centralized schema specifications with validation rules and governance controls
- **Identity Resolution**: Process of merging anonymous and known user profiles across devices and sessions
- **Data Transformations**: Retroactive event data modifications for schema evolution and data quality
- **Sources and Destinations**: CDP architecture components for data ingestion and activation

## Statistical Analysis and Machine Learning

The platform implements sophisticated statistical methodologies including Prophet-based anomaly detection, CUPED (Controlled-experiment Using Pre-Experiment Data) for variance reduction, and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for behavioral clustering in Personas charts.

**Experiment Analysis** utilizes mSPRT for sequential testing with configurable confidence intervals, mutual exclusion groups for preventing user overlap across experiments, and comprehensive lift calculations comparing absolute and relative improvements with statistical significance validation.

**AI-Powered Features** include transformer-based sequence models for predictive cohort generation, AutoML clustering for personalized recommendations, and conversational analytics through OpenAI LLM integration enabling natural language query capabilities.

## Compliance and Enterprise Capabilities

Amplitude maintains enterprise-grade security and compliance standards including SOC2 Type 2, GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA compliance with comprehensive data processing agreements and privacy controls. The platform supports EU data residency, automated data deletion through DSAR APIs, and sophisticated consent management integration.

**Data Governance** features include comprehensive audit trails, granular permission systems with role-based access controls, data retention policies, and advanced user privacy controls including opt-out mechanisms and PII masking capabilities.

The platform serves organizations from startups to enterprise customers through tiered subscription models (Starter, Plus, Growth, Enterprise) with scalable pricing based on Monthly Tracked Users and feature access, supported by comprehensive professional services for implementation and migration from competing platforms including Adobe Analytics, Google Analytics, Mixpanel, and Segment.
