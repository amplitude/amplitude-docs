# Amplitude Product Ecosystem

Amplitude is a comprehensive analytics and experimentation platform that helps businesses understand user behavior, optimize product performance, and make data-driven decisions. The platform consists of several integrated products that work together to provide a complete solution for product analytics, experimentation, and data management.

## Key Products and Features

### Amplitude Analytics
The core analytics platform that enables businesses to analyze user behavior and product performance through:
- **Event Segmentation**: Analyze specific user actions with customizable charts
- **Funnel Analysis**: Track user conversion through defined event sequences
- **Retention Analysis**: Measure ongoing user engagement over time
- **User Sessions**: Analyze user journeys and session-based metrics
- **Behavioral Cohorts**: Group users based on shared actions within specific timeframes
- **Dashboards**: Create collections of charts for monitoring key metrics
- **Notebooks**: Develop collaborative documents combining text, media, charts, and metrics

### Amplitude Experiment
A feature experimentation platform that allows teams to:
- Run A/B tests and feature flag experiments
- Analyze experiment results with statistical rigor
- Implement feature flags across different platforms
- Connect experiment results directly to analytics data

### Amplitude Data
A data management layer that includes:
- **Source Catalog**: Manage data sources and integrations
- **Destination Catalog**: Configure data export destinations
- **Audiences**: Create and manage user segments for targeting
- **CDP (Customer Data Platform)**: Unify customer data across touchpoints
- **PII Integrations**: Handle personally identifiable information securely

### Amplitude SDKs
Multiple SDK implementations for different platforms:
- **Browser SDK**: For web applications
- **iOS SDK**: For Apple mobile devices
- **Android SDK**: For Android mobile devices
- **React Native SDK**: For cross-platform mobile apps
- **Flutter SDK**: For cross-platform mobile development
- **Unity SDK**: For game development
- **Unreal SDK**: For game development with Unreal Engine
- **Node.js SDK**: For server-side implementations
- **Python SDK**: For backend services and data science
- **Java SDK**: For Java applications
- **Go SDK**: For Go applications

## Product Relationships and Integration

The Amplitude ecosystem is designed for seamless integration between components:

1. **Data Collection → Analytics**: Data collected through SDKs flows into Analytics for visualization and analysis
2. **Analytics → Experiment**: Analytics insights inform experiment design, and experiment results appear in Analytics
3. **Data Management → Analytics/Experiment**: The data layer ensures consistent data quality across products
4. **SDKs → All Products**: SDKs provide the implementation layer for tracking, experimentation, and data collection

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Data Structure
- **Events**: Tracked user actions (page views, clicks, etc.)
- **Properties**: Metadata associated with events or users
- **Cohorts**: User groups sharing common behaviors or characteristics
- **Sessions**: Groups of user events within a defined time period

### Organization
- **Spaces**: Organizational units with specific permission levels
- **Templates**: Reusable dashboard configurations with parameters
- **Charts**: Visual representations of analytics data

### Account Management
- **Single Sign-On**: Enterprise authentication integration
- **Billing and Use**: Account billing management
- **Account Management**: User permissions and settings
