Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive data-driven decision making through integrated analytics, experimentation, and data management capabilities.

## High-Level Product Overview

Amplitude consists of four core product areas: **Analytics** for behavioral analysis and user insights, **Experiment** for feature flagging and A/B testing, **Data** for governance and instrumentation management, and **Session Replay** for user experience optimization. The platform serves product teams, data analysts, engineers, and marketers who need to understand user journeys, measure feature impact, and optimize conversion funnels.

Key use cases include product analytics and user behavior analysis, A/B testing and feature experimentation, data quality monitoring and governance, customer journey mapping, conversion optimization, and real-time user session analysis. The platform supports both technical and non-technical users through code-free interfaces alongside developer-focused tools and APIs.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational layer, providing core behavioral analytics through multiple chart types including Event Segmentation (user behavior analysis), Funnel Analysis (conversion tracking), Retention Analysis (user engagement), Cohort Analysis (user grouping), Revenue LTV (monetization), User Sessions (journey mapping), and specialized charts like Compass, Stickiness, Lifecycle, Personas, Impact Analysis, and Journeys.

**Amplitude Experiment** integrates with Analytics for statistical analysis and provides feature flagging, A/B testing, and advanced experimentation capabilities including remote configuration, gradual rollouts, and experiment result analysis. The platform includes experiment theory documentation, advanced techniques, troubleshooting guides, and workflow management.

**Amplitude Data** functions as the governance layer, managing tracking plans, data quality, schema validation, and providing tools like Ampli for type-safe instrumentation. It includes data transformation capabilities, audience management, source/destination catalogs, and warehouse-native functionality.

**Session Replay** captures and analyzes user interactions for experience optimization, while **Guides and Surveys** enables in-product messaging and feedback collection.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** represent user actions or system occurrences tracked within applications, following naming conventions like "Product Viewed" or "Purchase Completed."

**Event Properties** are attributes specific to individual events (e.g., product_name, price), while **User Properties** are persistent attributes of users (e.g., subscription_tier, signup_date).

**Tracking Plans** serve as the schema definition for analytics implementation, specifying which events and properties to collect.

**Ampli** is Amplitude's type-safe code generation tool that creates strongly-typed tracking libraries based on tracking plans.

**Cohorts** are user segments defined by behavioral criteria or properties, used for analysis and targeting.

**Funnels** represent sequential user journeys through defined steps, measuring conversion rates and drop-off points.

**Experiments** encompass A/B tests, feature flags, and multivariate tests for product optimization.

**Destinations** are third-party tools that receive data from Amplitude for activation and downstream use.

**Sources** are data origins including SDKs, APIs, and integrations that send data to Amplitude.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates with the broader data and marketing technology ecosystem through extensive source and destination catalogs. **Source integrations** include popular tools like Segment, Salesforce, Zendesk, and various advertising platforms. **Destination integrations** enable data activation through tools like Facebook Ads, Google Ads, Braze, Iterable, and numerous other marketing and analytics platforms.

The platform supports **warehouse-native** deployments, allowing organizations to run Amplitude directly on their data warehouse (Snowflake, Databricks) while maintaining data residency. **CDP (Customer Data Platform)** capabilities enable real-time data streaming and audience synchronization.

**Partner integrations** extend functionality through specialized connectors and joint solutions with technology partners, while **PII integrations** provide privacy-compliant data handling for regulated industries.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/`) provides programmatic access to chart data, cohort definitions, and behavioral insights.

**Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) enable feature flag management, experiment configuration, and result retrieval.

**Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) supports in-product messaging and survey management.

**HTTP V2 API** serves as the primary event ingestion endpoint for sending behavioral data to Amplitude.

**Taxonomy API** enables programmatic management of event schemas, properties, and tracking plan definitions.

## SDK and Implementation Options

Amplitude provides comprehensive SDK coverage across platforms:

**Client-side SDKs** include Browser SDK (JavaScript), Android SDK, iOS SDK, React Native SDK, Flutter SDK, Unity SDK, and Unreal SDK for direct user interaction tracking.

**Server-side SDKs** encompass Node.js SDK, Python SDK, Java SDK, and Go SDK for backend event tracking and data processing.

**Ampli** generates type-safe tracking libraries available across all supported platforms, accessible via `/sdks/ampli/` routes.

The platform supports both **Autocapture** for automatic event collection and **manual instrumentation** for precise tracking control. **Chrome Extension** tools provide real-time debugging and validation capabilities for implementation teams.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** (`/admin/account-management/`) provides user provisioning, role management, and organizational controls.

**Single Sign-On** (`/admin/single-sign-on/`) enables enterprise authentication integration with SAML and OAuth providers.

**Billing and Use** (`/admin/billing-use/`) offers usage monitoring, plan management, and cost optimization tools.

The platform includes comprehensive **FAQ and Troubleshooting** resources, **Migration** guides for platform transitions, and **Academy Content** for user education and best practices.

Multi-language support includes **Japanese Translation** capabilities, demonstrating global accessibility and localization features.

This comprehensive platform architecture enables organizations to implement sophisticated product analytics workflows while maintaining data quality, supporting experimentation at scale, and integrating seamlessly with existing technology stacks.
