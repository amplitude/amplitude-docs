# Amplitude Analytics Platform

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools for product analytics, feature experimentation, customer data management, and user engagement optimization. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Core Product Architecture

**Analytics Foundation:**
The Analytics platform serves as the central hub, providing event tracking, user behavior analysis, and data visualization through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, Cohort Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Stickiness, Lifecycle, Personas, Revenue LTV, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Data Tables, and Compass. Legacy chart types are maintained for backward compatibility.

**Experimentation Platform:**
Amplitude Experiment enables feature flagging, A/B testing, and advanced experimentation techniques. The platform includes experiment theory documentation, workflow management, troubleshooting guides, and "under the hood" technical implementation details. Experiment Results charts provide specialized analytics for measuring experiment performance.

**Session Analytics:**
Session Replay captures and reconstructs user interactions across web and mobile applications, providing visual session playback and behavioral heatmaps for user experience optimization.

**User Engagement Tools:**
Guides and Surveys facilitate in-app messaging, user onboarding, and feedback collection with dedicated APIs for programmatic control.

**Data Infrastructure:**
The Customer Data Platform (CDP) manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation through source and destination catalogs, audience management, and warehouse-native capabilities.

## SDK and Integration Ecosystem

**Analytics SDKs:**
The platform provides comprehensive SDK coverage across platforms:
- **Web:** Browser SDK with JavaScript implementation
- **Mobile:** Android SDK (Kotlin), iOS SDK (Swift), React Native SDK, Flutter SDK, Unity SDK, Unreal SDK
- **Server-side:** Node.js SDK, Python SDK, Java SDK, Go SDK
- **Code Generation:** Ampli provides type-safe analytics implementation with auto-generated tracking libraries

**Experiment SDKs:**
Dedicated experimentation SDKs enable feature flag evaluation and experiment participation across all supported platforms.

**API Infrastructure:**
- **Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/`) provides programmatic access to event data and analytics results
- **Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) enable experiment management and flag evaluation
- **Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) supports campaign management and user targeting

## Data Management and Integration

**Source Catalog:**
Comprehensive data ingestion capabilities through pre-built integrations categorized by `integration_category` taxonomy, enabling data collection from various platforms and services.

**Destination Catalog:**
Data activation through numerous destination integrations, also categorized by `integration_category`, allowing data export to downstream systems and marketing tools.

**Audience Management:**
Advanced segmentation capabilities for creating and managing user cohorts based on behavioral patterns and event data.

**PII Integrations:**
Specialized handling of Personally Identifiable Information with dedicated privacy controls and compliance features.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management:**
Comprehensive organizational administration including user management, permissions, and organizational settings accessible via `/admin/account-management/` routes.

**Single Sign-On (SSO):**
Enterprise authentication integration supporting various identity providers through `/admin/single-sign-on/` configuration.

**Billing and Usage:**
Transparent usage monitoring and billing management through `/admin/billing-use/` interfaces, enabling cost optimization and plan management.

## Developer Resources and Support

**Getting Started:**
Structured onboarding documentation (`/get-started/`) covering initial setup, instrumentation guidance (`/sdks/`), and migration assistance (`/migration/`) for platform transitions.

**Academy Content:**
Educational resources and best practices for platform utilization and analytics implementation.

**FAQ and Troubleshooting:**
Comprehensive support documentation addressing common implementation challenges and platform-specific issues.

**Partner Ecosystem:**
Integration documentation for technology partners and third-party service providers.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Event Segmentation:** Core analytics chart type for analyzing event frequency and user behavior patterns over time

**Funnel Analysis:** Conversion analysis tool measuring user progression through defined steps or actions

**Retention Analysis:** User engagement measurement tracking user return behavior over specified time periods

**Cohort Analysis:** User grouping and behavior comparison across different user segments or time periods

**Feature Flags:** Dynamic configuration system enabling controlled feature rollouts and experimentation

**Experiment:** Controlled test comparing different user experiences or feature variations

**Session Replay:** Visual reconstruction of user interactions for experience optimization

**Ampli:** Code generation tool creating type-safe analytics implementations

**CDP (Customer Data Platform):** Unified data infrastructure for collection, transformation, and activation

**Audience:** User segment defined by behavioral criteria or event patterns

**Source:** Data ingestion point collecting events from applications or services

**Destination:** Data export endpoint sending processed data to external systems

**Mount:** Content management system identifier linking collections to specific content trees

**Navigation Title (nav_title):** Organizational structure identifier for documentation categorization

**Blade:** Product-specific branding identifier (e.g., "Amplitude Experiment", "Amplitude Session Replay")

## Route Structure and API Endpoints

The platform follows consistent URL patterns:
- Analytics: `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/{slug}`
- SDKs: `/sdks/{platform}/{slug}` or `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/{slug}`
- APIs: `/apis/{product}/{slug}`
- Experimentation: `/feature-experiment/{category}/{slug}`
- Data Management: `/data/{category}/{slug}`
- Administration: `/admin/{category}/{slug}`

## Multi-Site and Localization

The platform supports multi-site deployment with English (`en`) as the primary site and Japanese (`jp`) localization. Content propagation controls (`propagate: false`) manage content distribution across sites, while site-specific collections handle localized documentation.

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's architecture enables seamless data flow between products through shared user identification, session management, and event tracking. Analytics data informs experiment design, while experiment results feed back into analytics dashboards. Session Replay provides qualitative context for quantitative analytics insights, and Guides and Surveys enable direct user engagement based on analytical findings. The CDP serves as the foundational data layer supporting all product functionality while maintaining data governance and privacy compliance across the entire platform ecosystem.
