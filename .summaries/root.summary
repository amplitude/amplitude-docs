Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to collect, analyze, and act on user behavioral data across web, mobile, and server environments. The platform combines behavioral analytics, A/B testing, session replay, user engagement tools, and customer data management into an integrated ecosystem designed for data-driven product development.

## Product Architecture and Ecosystem

The Amplitude platform operates through five core product areas that work together to provide end-to-end analytics and experimentation capabilities:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational data collection and analysis engine, providing behavioral event tracking, user segmentation, and advanced visualization capabilities. This product handles the core data ingestion, processing, and querying that powers all other platform features.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities, enabling controlled feature rollouts and statistical experimentation. The experimentation platform integrates directly with Analytics data to provide comprehensive impact analysis and results interpretation.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user interaction recordings, providing qualitative insights to complement quantitative analytics data. This enables teams to understand not just what users do, but how they interact with products.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user engagement through targeted messaging, onboarding flows, and feedback collection. This product allows teams to act on analytics insights by directly engaging users within their product experience.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data integration, routing, and activation across the entire ecosystem. The CDP handles data ingestion from external sources, audience management, and data export to downstream systems.

## Analytics and Visualization Framework

Amplitude Analytics provides a sophisticated charting and analysis system organized into specialized analysis types, each designed for specific analytical use cases:

**Core Behavioral Analysis:**
- **Event Segmentation** enables detailed analysis of user actions with advanced filtering, grouping, and breakdown capabilities
- **Funnel Analysis** tracks conversion flows and identifies optimization opportunities in multi-step processes  
- **User Sessions** analyzes session-based behavior patterns and engagement metrics
- **Retention Analysis** provides cohort-based analysis of user return behavior over time

**Advanced Analytics Capabilities:**
- **Journeys** maps user paths and identifies common navigation patterns
- **Personas** creates behavioral user segments based on action patterns and properties
- **Lifecycle** tracks users through acquisition, activation, retention, and resurrection stages
- **Stickiness** measures product engagement frequency and habit formation
- **Engagement Matrix** provides multi-dimensional analysis of user engagement patterns
- **Revenue LTV** calculates customer lifetime value and revenue attribution
- **Impact Analysis** measures the effect of product changes on key metrics
- **Compass** tracks strategic metrics and goal achievement over time

The platform also includes **Data Tables** for raw data exploration and **Experiment Results** charts for statistical analysis of A/B test outcomes.

The platform also includes dedicated **Experiment SDKs** for feature flagging and A/B testing across all supported platforms.

## Data Management and Customer Data Platform

The CDP provides comprehensive data management capabilities organized into several key areas:

**Data Integration:**
- **Source Catalog** contains pre-built integrations for ingesting data from third-party platforms, organized by taxonomy categories including advertising, CRM, customer support, and business intelligence tools
- **Destination Catalog** provides data export integrations to downstream systems including advertising platforms, marketing automation tools, and data warehouses
- **Sources** handles configuration and management of data ingestion pipelines
- **Warehouse-native Amplitude** enables direct integration with cloud data warehouses for analysis without data movement

**Audience and Privacy Management:**
- **Audiences** provides user segmentation and audience creation capabilities for data activation
- **PII Integrations** handles personally identifiable information compliance and privacy controls

## API Infrastructure

Amplitude provides extensive REST API coverage across all product areas:

**Core APIs:**
- **Analytics API** enables programmatic data ingestion, querying, and export capabilities
- **Experiment APIs** provide experimentation management, feature flag configuration, and results retrieval
- **Guides and Surveys API** enables programmatic management of in-product engagement campaigns

The API infrastructure supports both direct REST endpoint usage and SDK-based implementations, providing flexibility for different integration approaches and technical requirements.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account and User Management:**
- **Account Management** provides organization administration, user provisioning, and permission management
- **Single Sign-on** enables enterprise authentication integration with SAML and OAuth providers
- **Billing and Use** offers usage monitoring, quota management, and billing administration

**Platform Onboarding and Migration:**

## Key Technical Architecture

**Content Management System:** The platform uses a UUID-based mount point system (e.g., `mount: ba956cb4-9ae1-456a-b122-984b491048f6`) for modular content organization and reuse across documentation sections.

**Multi-Site Deployment:** Supports English (`en`) and Japanese (`jp`) localization with content propagation controls and site-specific configurations for global market deployment.

**Navigation Architecture:** Uses systematic categorization through `nav_title` properties including `analytics`, `experiment`, `data`, `apis`, `admin`, and `developers` for consistent user experience.

**Product Branding:** Implements blade architecture with product-specific branding (`Amplitude Experiment`, `Amplitude Session Replay`, `Amplitude Guides and Surveys`) while maintaining unified platform experience.

**Content Versioning:** Supports staged content releases through date behavior controls with `past: public` and `future: private` settings, enabling controlled documentation updates and feature announcements.

The platform represents a comprehensive analytics and experimentation ecosystem designed for enterprise-scale behavioral analysis, with extensive integration capabilities, multi-language SDK support, and sophisticated data management tools optimized for modern product development workflows.
