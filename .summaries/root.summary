Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables product teams to understand user behavior, optimize experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform centers around event-based analytics, A/B testing capabilities, and user engagement measurement across web, mobile, and server-side applications.

## Product Architecture and Core Components

Amplitude's ecosystem consists of several interconnected products organized around a unified data foundation:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the core behavioral analytics engine, providing chart-based analysis tools including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Lifecycle analysis, Stickiness measurement, Revenue LTV tracking, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Personas clustering, Journeys mapping, Data Tables, and Compass strategic insights. Legacy chart types are maintained for backward compatibility.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced statistical methodologies, experiment theory foundations, workflow management, troubleshooting tools, and "under the hood" technical implementations. The platform includes specialized Experiment Results charts for analyzing test performance.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user session recordings to provide qualitative insights complementing quantitative analytics.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user research and engagement through targeted messaging and feedback collection.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** functionality includes data management, audience creation, source and destination catalogs with integration taxonomies, warehouse-native capabilities, and PII handling integrations.

## Technical Implementation and SDKs

The platform provides extensive instrumentation options through multiple SDK categories:

**Analytics SDKs** support all major platforms including Browser (JavaScript), iOS (Swift/Objective-C), Android (Java/Kotlin), React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine. Each SDK collection is mounted to specific content hierarchies with dedicated routing structures.

**Experiment SDKs** provide feature flag and experimentation capabilities across platforms with specialized routing under `/sdks/experiment-sdks/`.

**Ampli** offers a type-safe analytics wrapper that generates strongly-typed tracking libraries from Amplitude's tracking plans, mounted at `/sdks/ampli/`.

## API Infrastructure

Amplitude exposes comprehensive API access across product lines:

**Analytics APIs** provide programmatic access to event ingestion, data export, and behavioral cohorts management through endpoints like `/apis/analytics/`.

**Experiment APIs** enable programmatic experiment management, flag evaluation, and results analysis via `/apis/experiment/`.

**Guides and Surveys API** supports in-product messaging automation through `/apis/guides-and-surveys/`.

## Data Management and Governance

The platform implements sophisticated data handling through multiple collection types:

**Source and Destination Catalogs** manage data flow with integration taxonomies, supporting hundreds of third-party connections for data ingestion and activation.

**Audiences** enable behavioral segmentation and targeting based on user actions and properties.

**Data Tables** provide multi-dimensional analysis capabilities with advanced filtering and grouping.

**Warehouse-native Amplitude** allows direct analysis of data stored in customer data warehouses without data movement.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

Enterprise-grade capabilities include:

**Account Management** with user provisioning, role-based access control, and organization hierarchy management.

**Single Sign-On (SSO)** integration supporting SAML and other enterprise authentication protocols.

**Billing and Usage** monitoring with detailed consumption tracking and cost management tools.

Administrative functions are centralized under `/admin/` routing with dedicated navigation structures.

## Content Organization and Localization

The documentation architecture supports multi-site deployment with English (`en`) and Japanese (`jp`) localization. Content propagation controls and site-specific routing enable targeted documentation delivery. The platform includes Academy Content for educational resources and comprehensive FAQ and Troubleshooting sections.

## Partner Ecosystem and Migration Support

Amplitude maintains an extensive partner network with dedicated integration documentation and migration tooling to facilitate platform adoption. Web experiment capabilities provide specialized A/B testing for web properties with dedicated routing and navigation structures.

## Navigation and Information Architecture

The platform organizes content through hierarchical navigation structures including:
- `get_started` for onboarding and initial setup
- `analytics` for core analytics features
- `experiment` for A/B testing and feature flags
- `data` for CDP and data management
- `apis` for developer resources
- `session_replay` for session analysis
- `web_experiment` for web-specific testing

Each collection maintains specific routing patterns, preview capabilities, and injection parameters for consistent user experience across the platform. The system supports both root-level and nested content structures with configurable date-based publishing controls and revision management.
