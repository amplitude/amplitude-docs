Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive business growth through data-driven decision making. The platform integrates behavioral analytics, A/B testing, customer data management, and user experience tools into a unified ecosystem designed for product teams, marketers, and data analysts.

## Core Product Architecture

The Amplitude ecosystem is structured around four primary pillars that create an integrated data and analytics workflow:

**Amplitude Analytics** functions as the foundational analytics engine, offering behavioral analysis through specialized chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Impact Analysis, Revenue LTV, and Engagement Matrix. Each visualization provides targeted insights into user behavior patterns and business performance metrics.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced statistical analysis, supporting both client-side and server-side experimentation workflows. The platform includes experiment design theory, advanced testing techniques, comprehensive troubleshooting tools, and detailed results analysis with statistical significance calculations.

**Amplitude CDP (Customer Data Platform)** manages the complete data lifecycle through three core components: Amplitude Sources for data ingestion, Amplitude Activation for personalization and audience targeting, and Amplitude Data for export and destination management. The CDP enables conversion lift improvements of 15-30% through integrated data management and audience activation capabilities.

**Supporting Products** encompass Amplitude Session Replay for qualitative user experience analysis, Amplitude Guides and Surveys for in-product messaging and feedback collection, plus comprehensive administrative and data governance tools.

## Product Relationships and Integration

The platform operates through a unified data pipeline architecture where Amplitude Sources collects and ingests data from multiple touchpoints, feeding into the Analytics engine for behavioral analysis. This same data simultaneously powers Amplitude Experiment for hypothesis testing and Amplitude CDP for audience creation and activation workflows.

**Data Flow Architecture**: Sources → Analytics/Experiment/CDP → Data Export → External Destinations

**Identity Resolution System**: Unified user tracking across all products using a three-tier identity framework combining Amplitude ID, Device ID, and User ID relationships with automatic anonymous user merging capabilities.

**Cross-Product Features**: Shared audience segments, unified user profiles, consistent event tracking schemas, and synchronized user journeys across all platform components.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Identity Framework:**
- **Amplitude ID**: Automatically generated unique identifier for each user profile across the platform
- **Device ID**: Platform-specific identifier (IDFV for iOS, UUID for web browsers, IDFA/AdID for advertising attribution)
- **User ID**: Application-defined identifier for authenticated users
- **Anonymous User Merging**: Automated process that combines pre-authentication and post-authentication user data into unified profiles

**Analytics Terminology:**
- **Events**: Discrete user actions tracked within applications and websites
- **Properties**: Attributes and metadata associated with events or user profiles
- **Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments defined by behavioral patterns or predictive criteria
- **Funnels**: Sequential user journey analysis measuring conversion through defined steps
- **Retention**: Measurement of user return behavior over specified time periods
- **Stickiness**: Analysis of user engagement frequency within defined time windows

**Experimentation Concepts:**
- **Feature Flags**: Boolean toggles controlling feature visibility and functionality
- **Variants**: Different versions of features or experiences being tested
- **Statistical Significance**: Confidence level measurement in experiment results
- **Lift**: Percentage improvement in key performance metrics

**Data Management Terms:**
- **Sources**: Data input channels and third-party integrations
- **Destinations**: External platforms and tools receiving exported data
- **Syncs**: Automated data transfer processes between systems
- **Computations**: Custom metrics and calculated fields
- **Predictions**: Machine learning-generated behavioral forecasts and propensity scores
