Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive data-driven decision making across web and mobile applications.

## Product Architecture and Core Components

Amplitude operates as an integrated ecosystem of four primary products that work together to provide end-to-end user analytics and optimization capabilities:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, providing event tracking, user behavior analysis, and comprehensive reporting through multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Cohort Analysis, and specialized visualizations like Compass, Journeys, and Personas.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced statistical analysis, supporting experiment design, execution, and results interpretation through dedicated theory documentation and troubleshooting resources.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and reconstructs user interactions across platforms, providing visual session recordings, heatmaps, and detailed behavioral analysis while maintaining strict privacy compliance.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user engagement through targeted messaging, onboarding flows, and feedback collection mechanisms.

## Data Infrastructure and Integration Ecosystem

The platform operates through a sophisticated data management layer called the Customer Data Platform (CDP), which handles data ingestion, processing, and distribution across multiple touchpoints:

**Source Catalog** encompasses data collection from various platforms through SDKs (Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal, Node.js, Python, Java, Go) and third-party integrations categorized by integration types.

**Destination Catalog** manages data export and synchronization with external systems, organized by integration categories for seamless data flow to downstream applications.

**Ampli** provides a code-generation framework that creates type-safe analytics implementations, ensuring data quality and consistency across development teams.

## Technical Implementation and API Structure

The platform exposes functionality through multiple API layers:

**Analytics APIs** handle core event ingestion, user management, and data retrieval with endpoints structured around `/apis/analytics/` routes.

**Experiment APIs** manage feature flag configuration, experiment setup, and results retrieval through `/apis/experiment/` endpoints.

**Guides and Surveys API** controls in-product messaging and survey deployment via `/apis/guides-and-surveys/` routes.

**SDK Architecture** follows a hierarchical structure with platform-specific implementations under `/sdks/analytics/` and `/sdks/experiment-sdks/` routes, each providing comprehensive documentation for installation, configuration, and advanced usage patterns.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** represent discrete user actions tracked within applications, forming the fundamental data unit for all analytics operations.

**Properties** are attributes attached to events or users, enabling segmentation and detailed analysis across multiple dimensions.

**Cohorts** define user segments based on behavioral patterns or demographic characteristics, supporting targeted analysis and experimentation.

**Funnels** track user progression through defined sequences of events, measuring conversion rates and identifying optimization opportunities.

**Retention** measures user return behavior over specified time periods, providing insights into product stickiness and long-term engagement.

**Experiments** encompass A/B tests and feature flag implementations, with statistical frameworks for measuring impact and significance.

**Sessions** group related user interactions within defined time windows, enabling session-based analysis and replay functionality.

**Taxonomies** organize integrations and features by categories, supporting discovery and management of the extensive integration ecosystem.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

**Warehouse-Native Amplitude** enables direct analysis of data stored in customer data warehouses, eliminating data movement requirements while maintaining full platform functionality.

**Audiences** provides advanced user segmentation capabilities with real-time updates and cross-platform synchronization for targeted campaigns and analysis.

**Partners** ecosystem extends platform capabilities through certified integrations and specialized use case implementations.

**Migration** tools and documentation support transitions from other analytics platforms, ensuring data continuity and minimal implementation disruption.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

The platform includes comprehensive administrative capabilities:

**Account Management** handles user provisioning, permissions, and organizational structure configuration through `/admin/account-management/` interfaces.

**Single Sign-On** provides enterprise authentication integration with SAML and OAuth providers via `/admin/single-sign-on/` configuration.

**Billing and Use** offers usage monitoring, quota management, and billing administration through `/admin/billing-use/` dashboards.

**Data Governance** includes PII management, privacy controls, and compliance tools for handling sensitive data across all product components.

The platform supports multi-language implementations with Japanese translation capabilities and comprehensive FAQ and troubleshooting resources. The modular architecture allows organizations to implement components incrementally while maintaining data consistency and unified user tracking across all touchpoints. Advanced techniques documentation provides guidance for complex implementations, statistical analysis, and optimization strategies across the entire product ecosystem.
