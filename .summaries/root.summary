Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive data-driven decision making across web and mobile applications through event-based tracking, A/B testing, session replay, and customer data platform capabilities.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of four integrated product areas that form a complete analytics ecosystem:

**Amplitude Analytics** functions as the foundational data collection and analysis engine, providing event-based user behavior tracking through comprehensive SDKs spanning Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal platforms. The analytics engine supports 13 distinct chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Revenue LTV, and Experiment Results, enabling multifaceted behavioral analysis.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced statistical analysis, supporting complete experiment lifecycle management from hypothesis formation through results interpretation. The system includes dedicated Experiment SDKs and APIs for programmatic experiment control and automated decision-making workflows.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and reconstructs complete user interaction sequences through visual session recordings, heatmaps, and behavioral analytics while maintaining enterprise-grade privacy controls across web, mobile, and React Native platforms. The system provides configurable masking levels (Conservative/Light/Medium) for PII protection.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user engagement through targeted messaging campaigns and feedback collection mechanisms, with dedicated APIs for programmatic campaign management and response analysis.

## Data Management and Customer Data Platform

The Customer Data Platform (CDP) functionality orchestrates comprehensive data flows through Source and Destination Catalogs, supporting warehouse-native implementations and real-time audience segmentation. The platform manages data residency controls across US and EU server zones, ensuring compliance with regional data protection requirements.

**SDK Architecture:** The Ampli wrapper provides type-safe analytics implementation across all supported platforms, generating platform-specific tracking code that prevents instrumentation errors. The SDK Catalog offers consistent API patterns while accommodating platform-specific optimization requirements.

**Integration Ecosystem:** The platform connects with major analytics providers, marketing platforms, and data warehouses through bidirectional data synchronization, supporting both real-time streaming and batch processing workflows.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Analytics Foundation:**
- **Events**: Discrete user actions tracked within applications (clicks, page views, purchases, custom interactions)
- **Properties**: Metadata attributes associated with events and users enabling behavioral segmentation
- **Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments based on behavioral patterns or demographic criteria
- **Funnels**: Sequential conversion path analysis through predefined user journey steps
- **Retention**: Longitudinal user return behavior measurement across specified time intervals

**Experimentation Framework:**
- **Feature Flags**: Boolean configuration toggles enabling controlled feature rollout and instant rollback capabilities
- **Variants**: Alternative feature implementations tested against control groups in experiments
- **Statistical Significance**: Confidence threshold measurements ensuring experiment result reliability
- **Sample Rate**: User population percentage allocation for experiment participation

**Data Orchestration:**
- **Sources**: Input connectors ingesting data from external platforms, applications, and services
- **Destinations**: Output connectors distributing processed data to external systems and warehouses
- **Transformations**: Real-time data processing rules applied during ingestion pipeline execution
- **Audiences**: Behavioral segments exported to external marketing and activation platforms

**Privacy and Compliance:**
- **Data Residency**: Geographic data storage controls ensuring regional compliance (US/EU zones)
- **Consent Management**: GDPR/CCPA compliance framework integration with automated consent enforcement
- **PII Handling**: Personally identifiable information processing controls with configurable anonymization

## API Infrastructure and Technical Integration

**Analytics API**: Provides programmatic access to event ingestion, user property management, and behavioral data retrieval with RESTful endpoints supporting bulk operations and real-time streaming.

**Experiment API**: Enables automated experiment management including flag configuration, variant assignment, and statistical result retrieval through programmatic interfaces.

**Guides and Surveys API**: Supports campaign creation, targeting rule configuration, and response data collection through dedicated endpoints.

**Route Architecture**: The platform implements hierarchical URL structure with dedicated namespaces:
- `/analytics/` - Core behavioral analysis and chart configuration
- `/feature-experiment/` - A/B testing and feature flag management  
- `/session-replay/` - User interaction recording and analysis
- `/data/` - CDP functionality and data pipeline management
- `/sdks/` - Development tools and instrumentation libraries
- `/apis/` - Programmatic access documentation
- `/admin/` - Organizational administration and user management

## Enterprise Administration and Ecosystem Integration

**Account Management** encompasses comprehensive billing and usage monitoring, single sign-on (SSO) integration supporting SAML and OAuth protocols, and organizational administration with role-based access controls. The platform provides granular permission management enabling secure multi-team collaboration.

**Partner Ecosystem** includes pre-built integrations with major analytics providers, marketing automation platforms, and cloud data warehouses, supporting both real-time event streaming and scheduled batch synchronization patterns.

**Multi-language Support**: The platform includes Japanese localization with dedicated translation collections, indicating comprehensive international market support and cultural adaptation capabilities.

**Migration and Implementation Support**: The system provides structured migration paths for existing analytics implementations, comprehensive troubleshooting resources, and academy content for technical team onboarding and advanced feature adoption.

The platform architecture reveals an enterprise-grade analytics solution designed for technical teams requiring sophisticated user behavior analysis, statistical experimentation capabilities, and comprehensive data management across diverse technology stacks and complex organizational requirements.
