Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that provides businesses with event-based behavioral analytics, A/B testing capabilities, and user engagement optimization tools. The platform centers around tracking discrete user actions (events) with associated metadata to deliver deep insights into user behavior and product performance.

## Core Product Architecture and Relationships

Amplitude's ecosystem consists of several interconnected product suites that work together to provide end-to-end analytics and experimentation capabilities:

**Analytics Core**: The foundational analytics platform includes the main Analytics dashboard, various chart types (Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Revenue LTV, User Sessions, Journeys, Personas, Compass, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, Data Tables), and legacy chart support. These analytics tools are accessible through routes like `/analytics/{slug}` and `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/{slug}`.

**Amplitude Experiment**: A feature flagging and A/B testing platform that integrates with the analytics core, accessible via `/feature-experiment/{slug}` routes. This includes experiment theory, advanced techniques, workflow management, troubleshooting, and "under the hood" technical documentation.

**Session Replay**: User session recording capabilities that capture user interactions for qualitative analysis, available through `/session-replay/{slug}` routes.

**Guides and Surveys**: In-app messaging and survey capabilities for user engagement and feedback collection, documented under `/guides-and-surveys/{slug}`.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)**: Data management capabilities including audience creation, source/destination catalogs, and warehouse-native functionality, organized under `/data/{slug}` routes.

## Data Collection and SDK Architecture

Amplitude provides comprehensive SDKs across multiple platforms and languages:

**Analytics SDKs**: Platform-specific SDKs for data collection including Browser SDK, Android SDK, iOS SDK, React Native SDK, Flutter SDK, Unity SDK, Unreal SDK, Node.js SDK, Python SDK, Java SDK, and Go SDK. These are organized under `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/{slug}` routes.

**Experiment SDKs**: Specialized SDKs for feature flag evaluation and experiment participation, available through `/sdks/experiment-sdks/{slug}`.

**Ampli**: A code generation tool that creates strongly-typed analytics APIs from tracking plans, accessible via `/sdks/ampli/{slug}`.

**Web Experiment**: Specialized web-based experimentation tools available through `/web-experiment/{slug}`.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events and Properties**: Events represent discrete user actions following verb+noun naming conventions. Event properties provide contextual metadata, while user properties define user characteristics. The platform distinguishes between active and inactive events for analysis purposes.

**User Identification**: Multi-layered tracking system using Device IDs (platform-specific identifiers), Amplitude IDs (internal identifiers), and User IDs (application-specific identifiers for cross-device tracking).

**Sessions**: User interaction periods with platform-specific timeout intervals (5 minutes for mobile, 30 minutes for web), tracked via Session IDs generated as milliseconds since epoch UTC.

**Behavioral Cohorts**: User groups defined by shared behaviors or characteristics, used for segmentation and analysis.

**Monthly Tracked Users (MTU)**: Core billing and usage metric representing unique users tracked within a monthly period.

**Autocapture**: Automatic event tracking for common user interactions like page views, clicks, form submissions, and session management.

## API Endpoints and Integration Points

**Analytics APIs**: HTTP API v2 for server-side data ingestion (`/apis/analytics/{slug}`), Identify API for user property updates, Dashboard REST API, Export API, Attribution API, and Behavioral Cohorts API.

**Experiment APIs**: Dedicated APIs for feature flag management and experiment configuration (`/apis/experiment/{slug}`).

**Guides and Surveys API**: APIs for managing in-app messaging and survey campaigns (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/{slug}`).

**CLI Commands**: 
- `ampli pull` - Downloads generated tracking code from Amplitude Data tracking plans
- `ampli status` - Verifies local tracking implementation against remote schema

**Core SDK Methods**:
- `amplitude.init(apiKey, options)` - SDK initialization
- `amplitude.track(eventType, eventProperties)` - Event tracking
- `amplitude.identify(identifyObject)` - User property management
- `amplitude.flush()` - Force event transmission

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management**: User administration, team management, and organizational settings accessible through `/admin/account-management/{slug}`.

**Single Sign-On**: Enterprise authentication integration documented under `/admin/single-sign-on/{slug}`.

**Billing and Usage**: Usage monitoring, plan management, and billing administration via `/admin/billing-use/{slug}`.

**Privacy and Compliance**: Built-in GDPR/CNIL compliance features, consent management, data subject access rights (DSAR), and PII handling capabilities documented under `/data/pii/{slug}`.

## Broader Ecosystem Integration

**Partner Integrations**: Extensive third-party integrations documented under `/partners/{slug}`, including marketing platforms, data warehouses, and business intelligence tools.

**Source and Destination Catalogs**: Pre-built integrations for data ingestion (`/data/source-catalog/{slug}`) and data export (`/data/destination-catalog/{slug}`) with taxonomy-based organization.

**Migration Support**: Comprehensive migration documentation for transitioning from other analytics platforms (`/migration/{slug}`).

**Academy Content**: Educational resources and best practices for platform adoption and optimization.

The platform supports both English and Japanese localization, with dedicated content collections for international users. The documentation architecture uses a hierarchical structure with preview capabilities, content injection for navigation organization, and specialized routing patterns for different product areas.
