Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that provides businesses with behavioral analytics, feature experimentation, customer data management, and user engagement tools. The platform consists of several interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Core Product Architecture and Relationships

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational product, providing behavioral event tracking and analysis through multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Cohort Analysis (Lifecycle), Revenue LTV, Stickiness, Journeys, Personas, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Data Tables, and Compass. These analytics capabilities are supported by a comprehensive SDK ecosystem and REST APIs for data ingestion and analysis.

**Amplitude Experiment** enables feature flagging and A/B testing with advanced statistical analysis, experiment results visualization, and integration with the analytics platform for impact measurement. The product includes experiment theory documentation, advanced techniques, workflow management, troubleshooting resources, and "under the hood" technical implementation details.

**Session Replay** provides user session recording and analysis capabilities that integrate with analytics data to provide deeper behavioral insights.

**Guides and Surveys** (branded as "Amplitude Guides and Surveys") offers in-product user guidance and feedback collection tools with dedicated APIs for programmatic management.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation through source catalogs, destination catalogs, audience management, and warehouse-native capabilities.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Collections** represent content organization structures within the documentation system, each with specific routing patterns, navigation injection, and content management properties. Collections use `mount` identifiers to link related content and `inject` properties to assign navigation categories.

**Navigation Titles** (`nav_title`) organize content into logical sections including `analytics`, `experiment`, `data`, `apis`, `analytics_sdks`, `experiment_sdks`, `charts`, `get_started`, `admin`, `session_replay`, `guides_and_surveys`, `partners`, `faq`, and specialized catalogs.

**Blade Identifiers** specify product branding with values like "Amplitude Experiment", "Amplitude Session Replay", and "Amplitude Guides and Surveys" for product-specific documentation sections.

**Route Patterns** define URL structures using variables like `{slug}`, `{parent_uri}`, and `{{section}}/{{slug}}` for dynamic content routing across the documentation platform.

**Mount Points** are UUID identifiers that link collections to specific content hierarchies, enabling content reuse and cross-referencing between related documentation sections.

**Sites Configuration** supports multi-language content with `en` (English) and `jp` (Japanese) site variants, with `propagate` settings controlling content distribution across locales.

## SDK and API Ecosystem

The platform provides extensive SDK support across multiple programming languages and platforms:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine implementations, each with dedicated documentation collections and routing under `/sdks/analytics/`.

**Experiment SDKs** provide feature flagging capabilities across platforms with documentation routed under `/sdks/experiment-sdks/`.

**Ampli** serves as a type-safe analytics wrapper that generates strongly-typed tracking libraries from Amplitude's data taxonomy.

**APIs** encompass Analytics APIs (`/apis/analytics/`), Experiment APIs (`/apis/experiment/`), and Guides and Surveys APIs (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) for programmatic platform interaction.

## Data Management and Integration

The **Source Catalog** (`/data/source-catalog/`) provides data ingestion capabilities from various platforms and services, while the **Destination Catalog** (`/data/destination-catalog/`) enables data activation across marketing, advertising, and business intelligence tools. Both catalogs use `integration_category` taxonomies for organization.

**Audiences** (`/data/audiences/`) enable behavioral segmentation and cohort management, while **PII Integrations** (`/data/pii/`) handle personally identifiable information processing with privacy compliance.

**Warehouse-native Amplitude** (`/data/warehouse-native/`) provides analytics capabilities directly within customer data warehouses without data movement requirements.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** (`/admin/account-management/`) covers user provisioning, permissions, and organizational settings.

**Single Sign-on** (`/admin/single-sign-on/`) provides enterprise authentication integration with SAML and OAuth providers.

**Billing and Use** (`/admin/billing-use/`) manages subscription tiers, usage monitoring, and cost optimization.

## Content Organization and Localization

The platform supports **Japanese Translation** through dedicated collections with `hide_helpful` injection properties and specialized routing for localized content delivery.

**Academy Content** provides educational resources and training materials, while **FAQ and Troubleshooting** offers comprehensive support documentation.

**Partners** documentation covers third-party integrations and ecosystem relationships with dedicated mounting and navigation structures.

**Migration** resources assist customers transitioning from other analytics platforms with step-by-step implementation guidance.

The documentation architecture uses **date_behavior** settings with `past: public` and `future: private` configurations for content publication control, **preview_targets** for content review workflows, and **structure** settings defining hierarchical relationships between content collections.

This comprehensive product ecosystem enables businesses to implement complete behavioral analytics workflows from data collection through analysis, experimentation, and activation across their technology stack.
