# Amplitude Analytics Platform

Amplitude is an enterprise-grade product analytics and experimentation platform that provides comprehensive tools for data collection, behavioral analysis, feature experimentation, and customer engagement. The platform enables organizations to instrument their applications, analyze user behavior, conduct controlled experiments, and activate insights across their technology stack.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem consists of six interconnected core products that share data models and user contexts:

**Amplitude Analytics** forms the analytical foundation, offering chart-based analysis tools including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Cohort Analysis, and specialized visualizations like Compass, Journeys, and Personas. These tools consume event data and user properties to generate behavioral insights accessible through `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/{slug}` routes.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities that integrate with Analytics data for experiment analysis. It supports controlled feature rollouts, multivariate testing, and statistical analysis, accessible through `/feature-experiment/` routes with specialized sections for implementation theory and advanced techniques.

**Amplitude Data (CDP)** serves as the customer data platform orchestrating data flow between Analytics and Experiment while managing external integrations. It handles data ingestion through source catalogs, transformation via tracking plans, and distribution through destination catalogs, with audience creation capabilities that leverage Analytics cohorts.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user session recordings, providing qualitative context to quantitative Analytics insights and enabling deeper investigation of user behavior patterns identified through charts and funnels.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-app messaging and feedback collection, using Analytics cohorts for targeting and Experiment feature flags for controlled message delivery, supporting customer engagement workflows.

**Ampli** represents the type-safe analytics implementation layer that generates strongly-typed tracking libraries from Data tracking plans, ensuring consistent event instrumentation across platforms while providing compile-time validation.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** are discrete user actions tracked within applications (e.g., button clicks, page views, purchases), serving as the fundamental data unit across all Amplitude products. Events contain properties that provide contextual information.

**Properties** are attributes associated with events (event properties) or users (user properties) that enable segmentation, filtering, and analysis across Analytics charts and Experiment targeting.

**Cohorts** represent user segments defined by shared characteristics or behaviors, created in Analytics and reusable across Experiment targeting, Data audiences, and Guides campaigns.

**Tracking Plans** define event schemas, validation rules, and governance policies within Amplitude Data, serving as the authoritative source for analytics implementation and Ampli code generation.

**Feature Flags** control feature visibility and behavior within applications, managed through Experiment for controlled rollouts, A/B testing, and gradual feature deployment.

**Sources** are external platforms and services that send data to Amplitude through pre-built integrations in the source catalog, supporting comprehensive data collection strategies.

**Destinations** are external platforms receiving data from Amplitude through the destination catalog, enabling data activation and cross-platform analytics workflows.

**Warehouse-native** refers to analytics capabilities that operate directly on data warehouse infrastructure, supporting modern data stack architectures without data movement.

## SDK and Integration Ecosystem

The platform provides extensive SDK coverage across development environments:

**Analytics SDKs** support Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine platforms through `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/` routes, providing consistent event tracking APIs while accommodating platform-specific implementation patterns.

**Experiment SDKs** offer feature flagging capabilities across the same platform matrix through `/sdks/experiment-sdks/` routes, enabling consistent experimentation implementations with local evaluation and remote configuration capabilities.

Both SDK families integrate with Ampli-generated libraries to provide type-safe implementation with autocomplete support and compile-time validation.

## API Infrastructure and Endpoints

The platform exposes multiple API layers for programmatic access:

**Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/`) provides endpoints for event data retrieval, user property management, cohort definitions, and chart result extraction, supporting custom integrations and automated reporting workflows.

**Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) enable feature flag management, experiment configuration, variant assignment, and results analysis through programmatic interfaces supporting CI/CD integration and automated experimentation workflows.

**Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) supports programmatic campaign management, message delivery, and response collection for automated customer engagement workflows.

## Data Management and Integration Architecture

**Source Catalog** provides pre-built integrations accessible through `/data/source-catalog/` routes, organized by taxonomy categories including analytics platforms, customer data platforms, marketing tools, and custom webhook implementations.

**Destination Catalog** offers data export capabilities through `/data/destination-catalog/` routes, supporting data activation to advertising platforms, marketing automation tools, data warehouses, and custom endpoints.

**PII Integrations** handle personally identifiable information through specialized `/data/pii/` routes with privacy-compliant processing, encryption, and governance controls.

**Warehouse-native Amplitude** (`/data/warehouse-native/`) enables analytics directly on existing data warehouse infrastructure, supporting Snowflake, BigQuery, and Redshift implementations without data duplication.

## Enterprise Administration and Governance

**Account Management** (`/admin/account-management/`) provides organizational administration including user provisioning, role-based access control, project management, and cross-product permissions.

**Single Sign-on** (`/admin/single-sign-on/`) supports enterprise authentication through SAML, OIDC, and other identity provider integrations with automated user provisioning and role mapping.

**Billing and Usage** (`/admin/billing-use/`) offers usage monitoring, cost optimization tools, and billing management across all Amplitude products with detailed consumption analytics.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates with the modern data stack through warehouse-native capabilities, supporting dbt transformations, Reverse ETL workflows, and composable CDP architectures. The platform connects with marketing automation platforms, advertising networks, and customer engagement tools through the destination catalog, while ingesting data from product analytics tools, customer support platforms, and marketing channels through the source catalog.

The documentation structure supports multi-language access with English (`en`) primary content and Japanese (`jp`) translations, organized around navigation contexts including `analytics`, `experiment`, `data`, `apis`, `analytics_sdks`, `experiment_sdks`, `admin`, `get_started`, and `faq` sections. Content includes date-based visibility controls, preview capabilities, and hierarchical organization supporting both technical implementers and business users across the complete product analytics lifecycle.
