Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive data-driven decision making across web and mobile applications.

## High-Level Product Overview

Amplitude's platform consists of several interconnected products that form a complete analytics ecosystem:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the core product, providing event-based user behavior tracking, segmentation, and analysis through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Personas, Stickiness, Revenue LTV, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Data Tables, and Compass. The platform also includes legacy chart types for backward compatibility.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced statistical analysis, supporting experiment design, execution, and results interpretation through dedicated experiment theory documentation and advanced techniques.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and reconstructs user interactions across applications, providing session recordings, heatmaps, and behavioral analytics for detailed user experience optimization.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-app messaging and user feedback collection to drive engagement and gather insights directly from users.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** functionality includes data management, audience creation, source and destination integrations, and warehouse-native capabilities for organizations managing data across multiple systems.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

The Amplitude ecosystem operates through a hub-and-spoke architecture where Analytics serves as the central data collection and analysis engine, with other products building upon this foundation:

**Data Flow Architecture**: All products feed into a unified data model where events, user properties, and behavioral data are collected through various SDKs and APIs, then made available across the platform for analysis, experimentation, and activation.

**Cross-Product Integration**: Session Replay integrates with Analytics through session replay ID injection into event streams. Experiment results are analyzed using Analytics charts. Audiences created in the CDP can be used for targeting in Experiments and Guides and Surveys.

**Unified User Identity**: Device IDs, user IDs, and session IDs are synchronized across all products, enabling consistent user tracking and cross-product analysis capabilities.

**Shared Infrastructure**: Common authentication, billing, account management, and administrative controls span all products, with single sign-on support and unified organizational settings.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Analytics Concepts:**
- **Events**: User actions tracked within applications (clicks, page views, purchases)
- **Properties**: Attributes associated with events (event properties) or users (user properties)
- **Segments**: Filtered subsets of users or events based on specific criteria
- **Cohorts**: Groups of users who performed specific actions within defined time windows
- **Funnels**: Sequential user journey analysis showing conversion rates between steps
- **Retention**: Analysis of user return behavior over time periods

**Experimentation Terminology:**
- **Feature Flags**: Boolean controls for enabling/disabling functionality
- **Variants**: Different versions of features or experiences being tested
- **Allocation**: Percentage of users assigned to each experiment variant
- **Statistical Significance**: Confidence level that observed differences are not due to chance
- **Lift**: Percentage improvement of a variant compared to control

**Data Management Terms:**
- **Sources**: Systems that send data into Amplitude (SDKs, APIs, third-party integrations)
- **Destinations**: External systems that receive data from Amplitude
- **Transformations**: Data processing rules applied during ingestion
- **Audiences**: User segments that can be synced to external platforms
- **Warehouse-Native**: Architecture allowing analysis of data stored in customer data warehouses

**Technical Infrastructure:**
- **SDKs**: Software Development Kits for various platforms (Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal, Node.js, Python, Java, Go)
- **APIs**: RESTful interfaces for data ingestion, querying, and management
- **Ampli**: Code generation tool creating type-safe tracking implementations
- **Server Zones**: Geographic data residency options (US/EU)

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates extensively with external platforms and tools through multiple integration patterns:

**Analytics SDKs** support major development platforms with consistent APIs across Browser SDK, Android SDK, iOS SDK, React Native SDK, Flutter SDK, Unity SDK, Unreal SDK, Node.js SDK, Python SDK, Java SDK, and Go SDK implementations. Each SDK provides platform-specific optimizations while maintaining API consistency.

**Third-Party Integrations** include comprehensive source and destination catalogs supporting hundreds of tools across categories including advertising platforms, customer support systems, email marketing tools, data warehouses, and business intelligence platforms.

**Partner Ecosystem** enables specialized integrations and professional services through certified implementation partners and technology integrations.

**Enterprise Infrastructure** supports single sign-on (SSO) providers, custom domains, advanced security controls, and compliance frameworks including GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA requirements.
