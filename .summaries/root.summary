Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and optimization platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, conduct experiments, and activate insights across their entire product ecosystem. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products that work together to provide end-to-end analytics, experimentation, and user engagement capabilities.

## Core Product Architecture and Relationships

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational product, providing event-based behavioral analytics through sophisticated chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, and Pathfinder. The platform operates on an event-driven architecture where user interactions are captured as events with associated properties, supporting both individual user analysis and account-level reporting through the Accounts add-on.

**Amplitude Data** functions as the central governance layer, orchestrating data quality through tracking plans, schema management, and the Ampli developer tools that generate type-safe tracking libraries. The platform provides comprehensive data transformation capabilities, automated validation through the Observe feature, and maintains data lineage across the entire analytics ecosystem.

**Amplitude Experiment** enables feature flagging and A/B testing with advanced statistical analysis, supporting both client-side and server-side implementations. The platform integrates deeply with Analytics for experiment result analysis and provides sophisticated targeting mechanisms through behavioral cohorts and user segmentation.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** delivers in-product user experiences through contextual guides, feedback collection surveys, and an intelligent Resource Center. The platform replaces traditional popups with targeted, interactive experiences that drive user onboarding, engagement, and retention.

**Amplitude Sources** manages data ingestion and instrumentation, providing robust tools for event tracking, user identification, revenue monitoring, and session management across web and mobile applications. The platform serves as the central data collection hub with comprehensive third-party integrations.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events and Properties**: Events represent discrete user actions while properties provide contextual attributes. The platform distinguishes between event properties (action-specific), user properties (persistent user attributes), and group properties (account-level attributes for B2B analytics).

**Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments based on behavioral criteria, supporting both static cohorts (fixed user lists) and behavioral cohorts (dynamically updated based on user actions). Cohorts integrate across all chart types and can be synced to external platforms for activation.

**Tracking Plans**: Structured schemas in Amplitude Data that define events, properties, and validation rules, serving as the single source of truth for analytics instrumentation across development teams.

**Ampli**: Type-safe code generation tool that creates tracking libraries with autocompletion and compile-time validation, accessed through CLI commands like `ampli pull` and `ampli status --is-merged`.

**Groups and Group Types**: Account-level analytics framework enabling analysis of business accounts, teams, or other organizational units rather than individual users, supporting up to five group types per project.

**Sessions**: Periods of user activity with platform-specific timeout configurations (5 minutes for mobile, 30 minutes for web), tracked through session IDs and supporting comprehensive engagement analysis.

**Experiments**: A/B tests and feature flags with statistical analysis capabilities, supporting multiple allocation methods and integration with Analytics for comprehensive result analysis.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

The platform provides extensive API access across all products:

**Analytics APIs**:
- HTTP V2 API (`api2.amplitude.com`) for real-time event ingestion
- Batch API for bulk event processing
- Dashboard REST API for programmatic chart access
- Export API for data extraction with timezone standardization

**Data Management APIs**:
- Taxonomy API for programmatic schema management
- Group Identify API for account-level property updates
- Identify API for user property management

**Experiment APIs**:
- Evaluation API for feature flag and experiment variant retrieval
- Management API for experiment configuration and results

**Guides and Surveys APIs**:
- Engagement SDK with methods like `engagement.init()`, `engagement.boot()`, `engagement.gs.show()`
- Analytics integration through `forwardEvent()` methods

**Command Line Tools**:
- Ampli CLI for tracking plan management and code generation
- SDK configuration parameters including `setServerUrl()`, `apiEndpoint`, and proxy configurations

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates extensively with external platforms and serves as a central hub in the modern data stack:

**Data Infrastructure**: Native integrations with Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, and S3 for data warehouse synchronization, supporting both raw data export and transformed data activation.

**Marketing and Engagement Platforms**: Comprehensive destination catalog with 100+ integrations including Braze, Customer.io, Klaviyo, Facebook Ads, Google Ads, and Salesforce, supporting real-time cohort sync and event streaming.

**Development Tools**: Chrome extensions for debugging, Jira integration for workflow management, and comprehensive SDK support across web, mobile, and server-side platforms.

**Third-Party Analytics**: Segment integration (both Actions and Classic), Google Analytics bridge, and various attribution platforms for comprehensive marketing analytics.

**Collaboration Platforms**: Native integrations with Slack, Google Workspace, Atlassian products, Notion, and Miro for seamless workflow integration and chart sharing.

## Advanced Features and Capabilities

**Machine Learning and AI**: Anomaly detection using Prophet algorithms, AI-powered Data Assistant for tracking plan optimization, and semantic search in Resource Center for intelligent content recommendations.

**Enterprise Features**: Multi-project portfolios for cross-application analysis, advanced permission systems, SSO integration, and comprehensive data governance controls including PII classification and access management.

**Real-time Capabilities**: Event streaming with p95 latency targets of 60 seconds, real-time cohort synchronization, and live experiment result monitoring.

**Data Quality and Governance**: Automated schema validation, data transformation pipelines, bot traffic filtering, and comprehensive audit trails for compliance and data integrity.

The platform represents a mature, enterprise-grade analytics ecosystem that enables organizations to implement comprehensive product analytics, experimentation, and user engagement strategies while maintaining data quality, governance, and scalability across their entire digital product portfolio.
