Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven decision making. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and supporting infrastructure for data management and developer tooling.

## Core Product Architecture and Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem operates on a unified event-driven architecture where user interactions are captured as events with associated properties. This foundational data layer supports multiple product experiences:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the central analytics engine, processing behavioral data through sophisticated chart types (Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys) and providing advanced features like anomaly detection, forecasting, and cohort analysis. The platform supports both individual user analytics and account-level reporting through the Accounts add-on.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with both remote and local evaluation modes. It integrates deeply with Analytics data for user targeting and leverages the same event infrastructure for exposure tracking and statistical analysis.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures web application recordings synchronized with event streams, providing visual context for user behavior analysis through integration with Analytics charts and dashboards.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** delivers in-product user engagement through contextual guides, feedback collection, and help resources, utilizing the same user segmentation and targeting capabilities as other platform components.

The platform's **Customer Data Platform (CDP)** capabilities include a comprehensive Source Catalog with 70+ pre-built connectors, destination management, and real-time data streaming to external platforms.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events and Properties**: The fundamental data model consists of events (user actions) with event_type, user_properties, event_properties, and group_properties. Events flow through the HTTP V2 API (`/2/httpapi`) and Batch API (`/batch`) for ingestion.

**User Identity Management**: The platform maintains user identity through user_id and device_id mapping, with Global User ID enabling cross-project analytics through the Portfolio add-on. The Identify API manages user properties without triggering events.

**Groups and Account-Level Analytics**: Group types and group values enable B2B analytics, supporting up to 5 group types per project with event-level and user-level group associations.

**Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments based on behavioral criteria or static user lists, with support for complex temporal parameters and logical operators. Cohorts synchronize across products for targeting and analysis.

**Experiments and Feature Flags**: Experiments support A/B testing with statistical analysis, while feature flags enable progressive rollouts. Both utilize bucketing units (User ID, Device ID, Company ID) for consistent assignment and support remote/local evaluation modes.

**Charts and Dashboards**: Analytics visualizations organized into collaborative workspaces called Spaces, with hierarchical permissions and sharing capabilities. Charts support templating, filtering, and subscription-based reporting.

**Deployments**: Environment-specific configurations in Experiment that generate unique deployment keys for SDK authentication, categorized as client-side or server-side.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates extensively across the modern data and marketing technology stack:

**Data Infrastructure**: Warehouse integrations (Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks) support bidirectional data flow with multiple sync strategies including Change Data Capture (CDC) and Mirror Sync. Customer Data Platform integrations (Segment, mParticle, Tealium) enable unified data collection.

**Marketing and Growth Stack**: Attribution platform integrations (AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch) provide mobile attribution with 72-hour matching windows. Advertising platform connections (Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, TikTok) enable campaign performance analysis and audience synchronization.

**Developer Ecosystem**: Comprehensive SDK support across platforms (iOS, Android, Browser, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal) with both analytics and experiment capabilities. The Ampli code generation layer provides type-safe event tracking through CLI-generated wrapper code.

**Collaboration Tools**: Native integrations with Slack (notifications, chart unfurling), Atlassian products (Smart Links), Notion, and Miro enable seamless workflow integration.
