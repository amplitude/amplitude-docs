Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of several interconnected products: Analytics (the core behavioral analysis engine), Experiment (feature flagging and A/B testing), Session Replay (user interaction recording), Guides and Surveys (in-product user experience tools), and a Customer Data Platform for unified data management.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational layer, providing event tracking and behavioral analysis through specialized chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Revenue LTV, and Experiment Results. Each chart type offers distinct visualization and analysis capabilities for different aspects of user behavior patterns.

**Amplitude Experiment** integrates directly with Analytics to provide feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities. It includes advanced experimentation techniques, workflow management, and comprehensive result analysis that leverages the same event data foundation as Analytics.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and plays back user interactions to identify friction points, working in conjunction with Analytics to provide context for behavioral patterns observed in the data.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** delivers in-product experiences for onboarding and feedback collection, with interaction data feeding back into the Analytics platform for comprehensive user journey analysis.

The **Customer Data Platform (CDP)** unifies data management across all products through Sources (data ingestion), Destinations (data activation), and Audiences (user segmentation), with warehouse-native capabilities for organizations preferring to maintain data in their own infrastructure.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** are tracked user actions that form the foundation of all analytics, with associated **Properties** providing contextual attributes for both events and users.

**Cohorts** represent user segments defined by shared characteristics or behaviors, while **Audiences** extend this concept within the CDP for cross-platform activation.

**Funnels** track sequential user journeys through defined steps, with **Conversion Events** measuring desired outcomes.

**Retention** measures user return behavior over specified time periods, complemented by **Lifecycle** analysis for user state transitions.

**Amplitude IDs** serve as unique user identifiers across sessions and devices, ensuring consistent tracking.

In the experimentation domain, **Feature Flags** control feature availability for different user segments, **Variants** represent different feature versions, and **Exposure Events** track when users encounter experiment variants.

**Ampli** provides type-safe wrapper functionality, generating strongly-typed tracking libraries from Amplitude's Data taxonomy to ensure consistent event implementation across teams.

## SDK and Integration Ecosystem

The platform provides comprehensive SDK coverage across multiple environments:

**Analytics SDKs** support Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine, each following platform-specific conventions while maintaining consistent core functionality for initialization, event tracking, user identification, and configuration management.

**Experiment SDKs** provide feature flag evaluation and experiment participation across the same platform coverage, with consistent APIs for flag retrieval and variant assignment.

All SDKs follow standardized patterns for authentication, error handling, and data transmission while optimizing for platform-specific performance characteristics.

## API Infrastructure

The platform exposes comprehensive REST APIs for programmatic access:

**Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/`) provides endpoints for event ingestion, user management, and data retrieval with RESTful conventions.

**Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) enable programmatic flag management, experiment configuration, and results analysis.

**Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) supports content management and interaction tracking for in-product experiences.

All APIs implement consistent authentication, rate limiting, and error handling patterns across the platform.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates into the broader product development and marketing technology ecosystem through its **Source Catalog** and **Destination Catalog**, which provide standardized connections to various platforms and services. The Source Catalog enables data ingestion from marketing tools, customer support platforms, and other business systems, while the Destination Catalog facilitates data activation across marketing automation, data warehouses, and business intelligence tools.

**Partner integrations** extend platform capabilities through certified third-party extensions and ecosystem partnerships, documented in the Partners collection.

The platform supports enterprise requirements through **Single Sign-On** integration with SAML and OAuth providers, comprehensive **Account Management** for organization-level controls, and **PII Integrations** for privacy-compliant data handling.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** (`/admin/account-management/`) provides organization-level user access controls, permissions management, and configuration settings.

**Billing and Usage** (`/admin/billing-use/`) offers usage monitoring, plan management, and cost optimization tools for enterprise deployments.

The platform supports internationalization through multi-language capabilities, including comprehensive Japanese localization with dedicated content routing and navigation for both English (`en`) and Japanese (`jp`) markets.

**Migration** documentation assists organizations transitioning from other analytics platforms, while **Get Started** guides provide structured onboarding flows. **Academy Content** delivers educational resources and certification programs for users at different skill levels.

The architecture emphasizes modularity, allowing organizations to adopt individual components or the complete suite while maintaining data consistency and integration across all products through unified user identification and event tracking systems.
