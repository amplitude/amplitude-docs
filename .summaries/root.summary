Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, run experiments, and optimize digital experiences through data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Product Architecture and Core Components

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, providing behavioral event tracking and analysis capabilities through multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Revenue LTV, and Experiment Results. Each chart type offers specialized visualization and analysis capabilities for different behavioral patterns and business metrics.

**Amplitude Experiment** functions as a feature flagging and A/B testing platform with advanced statistical capabilities, supporting both client-side and server-side experimentation workflows. The platform includes experiment theory documentation, advanced techniques, troubleshooting resources, and comprehensive SDK support.

**Session Replay** captures and analyzes user session recordings to provide qualitative insights into user behavior and experience issues.

**Guides and Surveys** enables in-product messaging and user feedback collection through targeted campaigns and survey deployment.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation through source and destination catalogs, audience management, and warehouse-native capabilities.

## SDK and API Ecosystem

The platform provides extensive SDK coverage across multiple programming languages and platforms:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal implementations, each following consistent initialization patterns and event tracking methodologies.

**Experiment SDKs** offer feature flag and experimentation capabilities across the same platform coverage with both local and remote evaluation modes.

**Ampli** serves as a type-safe wrapper and code generation tool that ensures consistent event tracking implementation across development teams and platforms.

**API Infrastructure** includes Analytics APIs for event ingestion and data export, Experiment APIs for flag management and evaluation, and Guides and Surveys APIs for campaign management. All APIs follow RESTful conventions with comprehensive authentication and rate limiting.

## Data Management and Integration

**Source Catalog** provides pre-built integrations for data ingestion from various platforms, categorized by integration types and supporting both real-time and batch data collection methods.

**Destination Catalog** enables data activation by sending processed insights and audiences to downstream marketing, analytics, and operational tools through standardized integration patterns.

**Audiences** functionality allows creation of dynamic user segments based on behavioral criteria, with real-time updates and cross-platform activation capabilities.

**Warehouse-native Amplitude** supports direct analysis of data stored in customer data warehouses without requiring data movement, enabling analysis at scale while maintaining data governance requirements.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** provides organization-level controls for user provisioning, project management, and cross-product access coordination.

**Single Sign-On (SSO)** integration supports enterprise authentication requirements with SAML and OAuth protocols.

**Billing and Use** management includes usage monitoring, plan management, and cost optimization tools across all Amplitude products.

**PII Integrations** ensure compliance with data privacy regulations through specialized handling of personally identifiable information.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** represent discrete user actions tracked within applications, containing properties that describe the context and attributes of the action.

**User Properties** store persistent attributes about users that remain consistent across sessions and events.

**Cohorts** define user segments based on behavioral criteria or imported user lists, enabling targeted analysis and experimentation.

**Funnels** track user progression through defined sequences of events, measuring conversion rates and identifying drop-off points.

**Retention** measures user return behavior over specified time periods, indicating product stickiness and engagement quality.

**Amplitude ID** serves as the unified user identifier that connects user behavior across devices and sessions.

**Deployments** in Experiment context represent environment-specific configurations for feature flags and experiments.

**Variants** define different treatment conditions within experiments, including control and treatment groups.

**Allocation** determines what percentage of users are included in experiments or feature flag evaluations.

## Navigation and Content Organization

The documentation follows a hierarchical structure with primary navigation categories:

- **Get Started** covers initial setup, instrumentation basics, and migration guidance
- **Analytics** encompasses all chart types, analysis methodologies, and behavioral insights
- **Data** includes CDP functionality, sources, destinations, and data management
- **APIs** provides comprehensive API documentation across all products

## Ecosystem Integration and Workflow

Amplitude products integrate seamlessly to provide end-to-end analytics and optimization workflows. Analytics data informs experiment design and audience creation, while experiment results feed back into analytics for comprehensive impact analysis. Session Replay provides qualitative context for quantitative insights, and Guides and Surveys enable direct user feedback collection based on behavioral triggers.

The platform supports both technical and business users through role-based access controls, with developers accessing SDKs and APIs while business users leverage the web interface for analysis and campaign management. Cross-product data sharing ensures consistent user identification and behavioral tracking across all Amplitude products.

**Partner Integrations** extend platform capabilities through third-party connections, enabling data sharing with marketing automation, customer support, and business intelligence tools.

**Migration Support** assists organizations transitioning from other analytics platforms, providing data mapping guidance and implementation best practices to ensure continuity of insights and analysis capabilities.
