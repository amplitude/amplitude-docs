Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Core Product Architecture and Relationships

The platform operates through several primary products that work together to provide end-to-end user analytics and optimization:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, providing event tracking, user segmentation, and behavioral analysis through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Personas, Stickiness, Revenue LTV, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Data Tables, and Compass. These charts enable deep analysis of user behavior patterns and product performance metrics.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities, integrating closely with Analytics for experiment analysis and results measurement. It includes advanced techniques, experiment theory, workflow management, and troubleshooting tools.

**Session Replay** captures and analyzes user sessions to provide visual insights into user interactions and behavior patterns.

**Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user engagement through targeted onboarding experiences and feedback collection, operating through guides (tours, announcements, checklists, banners, tooltips) and surveys (NPS, user feedback, rating).

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation through source and destination catalogs, audiences, and warehouse-native capabilities.

## Technical Implementation and SDKs

The platform provides comprehensive SDK coverage across multiple platforms and languages:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal implementations, each following platform-specific patterns while maintaining consistent event tracking and user identification capabilities.

**Experiment SDKs** provide feature flag evaluation and experiment participation across the same platform ecosystem.

**Ampli** serves as a code-generation tool that creates type-safe analytics implementations based on tracking plans, ensuring data quality and consistency across implementations.

## API Infrastructure

The platform exposes multiple API endpoints:

**Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/`) provides programmatic access to event data, user properties, and analytics results.

**Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) enable feature flag management, experiment configuration, and results retrieval.

**Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) supports programmatic control of in-product messaging and survey deployment.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** are discrete user actions tracked within applications, forming the foundation of all analytics.

**Properties** are attributes associated with events or users that enable segmentation and analysis.

**Segments** are dynamic user groups based on behavioral criteria or properties.

**Cohorts** are static user groups created at specific points in time.

**Funnels** track user progression through defined sequences of events.

**Retention** measures user return behavior over time periods.

**Lifecycle** categorizes users based on their engagement patterns (New, Current, Dormant, Resurrected).

**Personas** create behavioral user segments based on event patterns and properties.

**Feature Flags** control feature visibility and behavior without code deployments.

**Experiments** are controlled tests comparing different user experiences or feature variations.

**Variants** are different versions of features or experiences being tested in experiments.

**Exposure Events** track when users encounter experiment variants.

**Statistical Significance** indicates confidence levels in experiment results.

**Lift** measures the percentage improvement of experiment variants over control groups.

## Data Management and Integration

The platform supports extensive data integration through:

**Source Catalog** provides pre-built integrations for data ingestion from various platforms and services, categorized by integration types.

**Destination Catalog** enables data activation by sending processed data to downstream tools and platforms.

**Audiences** create targetable user segments that can be synced to external platforms for marketing and personalization.

**PII Integrations** handle personally identifiable information with appropriate privacy controls.

**Warehouse-native Amplitude** enables analytics directly on data warehouse infrastructure.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** provides user provisioning, role management, and access controls.

**Single Sign-on** enables enterprise authentication integration.

**Billing and Use** tracks platform usage and manages subscription limits.

The platform implements hierarchical permission systems with roles like Viewer, Member, and Manager providing different levels of access to features and data.

## Internationalization and Localization

The platform supports multiple languages with dedicated Japanese translation collections and localization frameworks for SDKs and user interfaces. Content can be configured for different sites (en, jp) with propagation controls and region-specific routing.

## Migration and Onboarding

Comprehensive migration tools and documentation support transitions from other analytics platforms, with getting started guides, instrumentation best practices, and troubleshooting resources.

## Partner Ecosystem

The platform integrates with numerous third-party tools and services through a partner ecosystem, enabling data sharing, workflow integration, and extended functionality.

## Content Organization and Documentation

The documentation is structured hierarchically with collections organized by product area, feature type, and user journey stage. Each collection includes routing patterns (e.g., `/analytics/charts/`, `/sdks/analytics/`, `/feature-experiment/`), navigation injection for consistent user experience, and preview capabilities for content validation.

The platform uses mount points to organize related content and supports taxonomies for categorizing integrations and features. Content behavior is controlled through date-based visibility rules and revision management systems.
