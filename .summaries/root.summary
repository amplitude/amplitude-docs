# Amplitude Documentation Product Overview

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics platform that helps organizations understand user behavior, optimize digital experiences, and drive business growth. The platform enables tracking, analyzing, and visualizing user interactions across digital products, running experiments, managing customer data, and making data-driven decisions.

Key features include behavioral analytics with various visualization tools, experimentation and A/B testing capabilities, customer data platform (CDP) functionality, session recording and replay, cross-platform SDK support, extensive API access, and data integration with various sources and destinations.

Primary use cases include product analytics, user behavior analysis, feature experimentation, conversion optimization, and customer journey mapping.

## Product Relationships and Structure

The Amplitude ecosystem consists of several interconnected products:

1. **Amplitude Analytics** - The core platform providing behavioral analytics through:
   - Various chart types (Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention, etc.)
   - User behavior analysis tools (User Sessions, Personas, Journeys)
   - Custom dashboards and reporting

2. **Amplitude Experiment** - Built on Analytics, enabling:
   - A/B testing and feature flagging
   - Experiment targeting and segmentation
   - Statistical analysis of experiment results
   - Integration with Analytics for deeper insights

3. **Amplitude CDP** - Manages data flows with:
   - Source integrations for data ingestion
   - Destination integrations for data export
   - Audience management and segmentation
   - PII handling and privacy controls

4. **Amplitude Session Replay** - Provides visual session recordings that:
   - Complement quantitative Analytics data
   - Enable qualitative user experience analysis
   - Help identify UX issues and opportunities

These products share implementation resources (SDKs, APIs) and administrative tools, creating an integrated analytics ecosystem.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Events**: User actions or system occurrences tracked in Amplitude
- **Properties**: Metadata associated with events or users
- **User Properties**: Attributes that describe users (demographics, preferences, etc.)
- **Event Properties**: Attributes specific to individual events
- **Charts**: Visualization tools for analyzing user behavior
- **Cohorts**: Groups of users who share common behaviors or attributes
- **Audiences**: Defined user segments based on behavior or properties
- **Experiments**: A/B tests to measure the impact of product changes
- **Variations**: Different versions of a feature being tested in experiments
- **Sources**: Data integration points that bring data into Amplitude
- **Destinations**: Integration points that export data from Amplitude
- **SDKs**: Software Development Kits for implementing Amplitude tracking
- **Ampli**: Type-safe wrapper for SDKs providing code completion and validation
- **Session Replay**: Visual recording of user sessions for qualitative analysis
- **CDP**: Customer Data Platform for managing customer data across touchpoints

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's products form a cohesive ecosystem:

1. **Data Collection Layer**: SDKs and APIs capture user behavior data across platforms, while Sources bring in data from third-party tools.

2. **Data Processing Layer**: Raw event data is processed, enriched, and stored according to the tracking plan and data governance rules.

3. **Analysis Layer**: Analytics provides visualization and analysis tools to derive insights from the collected data.

4. **Action Layer**: 
   - Experiment uses insights to test hypotheses and optimize experiences
   - CDP exports segments to marketing and engagement tools
   - Session Replay provides qualitative context for quantitative findings

5. **Integration Layer**: Destinations connect Amplitude data to external tools in the customer's tech stack.

This integrated approach allows organizations to move from data collection to insight to action within a single ecosystem, while also connecting with external tools through an extensive integration network.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

### Analytics API
- Endpoints for querying analytics data, managing users, and accessing charts
- Supports both REST and HTTP/2 protocols

### Experiment API
- Endpoints for creating and managing experiments, variations, and results
- Supports feature flag management and experiment targeting

### SDK Implementation
Amplitude provides SDKs for multiple platforms:

- **Client-side SDKs**: Browser/JavaScript, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal
- **Server-side SDKs**: Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Ruby, PHP
- **Ampli SDK**: Type-safe wrapper available for multiple platforms

Each SDK follows a similar implementation pattern:
1. Initialize the SDK with API key
2. Set user identification
3. Track events with optional properties
4. Manage user properties
5. Handle session lifecycle

The platform supports both client-side and server-side tracking, with options for batching, offline support, and various configuration options to optimize performance and data quality.
