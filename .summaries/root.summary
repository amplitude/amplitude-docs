Amplitude is a comprehensive behavioral analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment (A/B testing), Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Core Product Architecture and Relationships

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational product, providing behavioral event tracking and analysis through a sophisticated charting ecosystem. The analytics platform includes specialized chart types: Event Segmentation for user action analysis, Funnel Analysis for conversion optimization, Retention Analysis for user engagement measurement, Cohorts for audience segmentation, User Sessions for session-based analytics, Journeys for user path analysis, and Revenue LTV for monetization insights. Advanced chart types include Compass (metric monitoring), Personas (user clustering), Lifecycle (user state transitions), Stickiness (engagement frequency), Impact Analysis (statistical significance testing), and Engagement Matrix (feature adoption correlation).

**Amplitude Experiment** integrates deeply with the analytics platform to provide feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities. The experimentation framework includes advanced statistical methodologies, sequential testing, and automated experiment analysis. Experiment results are visualized through dedicated chart types within the analytics interface, creating a unified view of feature performance and user behavior impact.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and reconstructs user sessions for qualitative analysis, complementing quantitative behavioral data with visual context. Session recordings integrate with analytics events to provide comprehensive user experience insights.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product messaging and user feedback collection, with survey responses and guide interactions automatically tracked as behavioral events within the analytics platform.

## Data Infrastructure and Customer Data Platform

The **Amplitude CDP** orchestrates data collection, transformation, and activation across the entire customer data ecosystem. The platform supports sophisticated data ingestion through the Source Catalog (80+ integrations) and data activation through the Destination Catalog, enabling organizations to create unified customer profiles and activate behavioral insights across their technology stack.

**Audiences** functionality allows creation of behavioral cohorts that can be exported to marketing platforms, advertising networks, and customer engagement tools for targeted campaigns and personalization. The CDP includes advanced identity resolution, real-time data processing, and privacy-compliant data management.

**Warehouse-native Amplitude** provides direct integration with cloud data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks), enabling organizations to analyze behavioral data alongside business intelligence and operational data within their existing data infrastructure.

## SDK Ecosystem and Instrumentation

Amplitude provides comprehensive SDK coverage across platforms and languages:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser SDK (JavaScript), iOS SDK (Swift/Objective-C), Android SDK (Java/Kotlin), React Native SDK, Flutter SDK, Unity SDK, Unreal SDK, Node.js SDK, Python SDK, Java SDK, and Go SDK. Each SDK provides platform-optimized event tracking, user identification, and behavioral data collection.

**Experiment SDKs** offer feature flag evaluation and experiment assignment across all supported platforms, with real-time flag updates and local evaluation capabilities for performance optimization.

**Ampli** serves as a type-safe wrapper that generates strongly-typed tracking libraries from Amplitude's Data taxonomy, ensuring consistent event implementation across development teams and platforms.

## API Architecture and Integration Endpoints

**Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/`) provides programmatic access to behavioral data, chart configurations, and user properties with endpoints for event ingestion, user management, and data export.

**Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) enable feature flag management, experiment configuration, and results analysis through RESTful endpoints supporting both management operations and real-time flag evaluation.

**Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) facilitates programmatic creation and management of in-product messaging campaigns and survey distribution.

The platform supports both server-side and client-side API implementations with comprehensive authentication mechanisms including API keys, OAuth flows, and service account configurations.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** represent discrete user actions tracked within applications, containing properties that describe the action context and user attributes that describe the user performing the action.

**Cohorts** are dynamic user segments based on behavioral criteria, demographic properties, or custom definitions that automatically update as user behavior changes.

**Funnels** analyze sequential user actions to identify conversion rates and drop-off points in critical user journeys.

**Retention** measures user return behavior over specified time periods, typically calculated as N-day, weekly, or monthly retention rates.

**Amplitude IDs** serve as universal user identifiers that persist across sessions and devices, enabling cross-platform user journey analysis.

**User Properties** store persistent attributes about users (demographics, subscription status, user preferences) while **Event Properties** capture contextual information about specific actions.

## Enterprise Administration and Governance

**Account Management** (`/admin/account-management/`) provides organizational controls for user permissions, project access, and team collaboration with role-based access control and audit logging.

**Single Sign-On** (`/admin/single-sign-on/`) supports enterprise authentication through SAML and OAuth integrations with identity providers like Okta, Azure AD, and Google Workspace.

**Billing and Use** (`/admin/billing-use/`) offers usage monitoring, plan management, and cost optimization tools with detailed event volume tracking and overage alerts.

The platform includes comprehensive privacy controls supporting GDPR, CCPA, and other regulatory requirements through automated data deletion, consent management, and regional data residency options.

## Advanced Analytics Capabilities

**Legacy Charts** maintain backward compatibility with deprecated chart types while **Other Charts** encompass specialized visualization types for specific use cases.

**Data Tables** provide raw data access and custom query capabilities for advanced analysis beyond standard chart types.

The platform supports advanced statistical analysis including confidence intervals, statistical significance testing, and predictive analytics through machine learning models.

## Migration and Integration Support

**Migration** tools facilitate data platform transitions from competitors like Google Analytics, Mixpanel, and Adobe Analytics with automated data mapping and validation.

**Partners** ecosystem includes certified implementation partners, technology integrations, and consulting services for enterprise deployments.

The platform provides comprehensive **FAQ and Troubleshooting** resources, **Academy Content** for user education, and extensive documentation covering implementation best practices, data governance, and advanced analytics methodologies.

Amplitude's architecture enables organizations to implement comprehensive behavioral analytics programs that scale from startup product analytics to enterprise-grade customer intelligence platforms, with deep integration capabilities across modern technology stacks and robust governance frameworks for data-driven organizations.
