Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven decision making. The platform consists of four core products: Analytics, Experiment, Data, and Session Replay, supported by extensive SDK libraries, APIs, and integration capabilities.

## High-Level Product Overview

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational behavioral analytics engine, providing 15+ chart types for analyzing user journeys, conversion funnels, retention patterns, and engagement metrics. The platform processes events through a sophisticated event tracking system that captures user actions, properties, and contextual data across web and mobile applications.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers A/B testing and feature flag management capabilities with both remote and local evaluation modes, statistical analysis tools including mSPRT and CUPED variance reduction, and automated traffic allocation through machine learning algorithms.

**Amplitude Data** functions as the governance and data quality layer, providing tracking plan management, schema validation, real-time data monitoring, and code generation through the Ampli wrapper system that creates strongly-typed analytics implementations.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and reconstructs user sessions for qualitative analysis, enabling teams to understand user behavior beyond quantitative metrics through visual session recordings and interaction analysis.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

The products operate as an integrated ecosystem where Data serves as the foundational governance layer, Analytics provides the core behavioral insights, Experiment enables optimization through testing, and Session Replay adds qualitative context. This integration is facilitated through:

**Unified Identity Management**: All products share consistent user identification through amplitude_id, user_id, and device_id systems, enabling cross-product user journey analysis and consistent experimentation targeting.

**Event Schema Consistency**: Amplitude Data's tracking plans ensure consistent event structures across Analytics charts, Experiment exposure tracking, and Session Replay correlation analysis.

**Behavioral Cohort Integration**: Analytics-generated cohorts serve as targeting mechanisms for Experiment audience definition and Session Replay user filtering.

**Statistical Framework Alignment**: Experiment's statistical analysis capabilities leverage Analytics' event data for comprehensive A/B testing analysis and impact measurement.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Monthly Tracked Users (MTU)**: Primary billing metric representing unique users tracked within calendar month boundaries, calculated through sophisticated user identification and event attribution mechanisms.

**Event Tracking Architecture**: Events represent user actions with associated properties, processed through HTTP V2 API endpoints with batching, retry logic, and real-time validation against tracking plan schemas.

**Behavioral Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments based on action sequences, property values, or engagement patterns, updated in real-time and used across all platform products for targeting and analysis.

**Plugin Architecture**: Extensible system supporting enrichment plugins (data enhancement) and destination plugins (event routing) across SDK implementations.

**Autocapture**: Automatic tracking of user interactions including page views, sessions, form interactions, file downloads, and element clicks without manual instrumentation.

**Sticky Bucketing**: Deterministic experiment assignment algorithm ensuring consistent variant allocation even when experiment configurations change.

**Schema Violations**: Events or properties that don't conform to defined tracking plan structures, with configurable handling through "Mark As Unexpected" or "Reject" responses.

**Derived Properties**: Retroactively created event properties using formula-based transformations with functions like REGEXEXTRACT, SPLIT, and CONCAT.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude positions itself as the central behavioral data hub within modern data stacks through extensive integration capabilities:

**Source Integrations**: 70+ connectors including data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks), marketing platforms (Facebook Ads, Google Ads), customer engagement tools (Braze, Intercom), and mobile attribution platforms (AppsFlyer, Adjust).

**Destination Catalog**: 100+ destinations enabling real-time event streaming, cohort synchronization, and data warehouse exports for activating behavioral insights across marketing, product, and customer engagement workflows.

**Development Workflow Integration**: Git-like versioning for tracking plans, CI/CD pipeline integration through Ampli CLI, and comprehensive SDK support across web (JavaScript/TypeScript), mobile (iOS Swift, Android Kotlin), and server-side (Node.js, Python, Go, Java) platforms.

**Enterprise Data Infrastructure**: Support for EU data residency, GDPR compliance, SSO integration through SAML 2.0, and enterprise-grade security with role-based access controls and data classification capabilities.

## API Endpoints and Command Line Interfaces

**Core Analytics APIs**:
- HTTP V2 API: `api.amplitude.com/2/httpapi` for event ingestion
- Identify API: User property management and identification
- Batch Event Upload API: High-volume event processing
- Dashboard REST API: Programmatic access to chart data and configurations
- Taxonomy API: CRUD operations for event types, properties, and categories

**Experiment APIs**:
- Flag Evaluation API: `/v1/vardata` for variant assignment
- Assignment and Exposure tracking through SDK `.variant()` method calls
- Remote evaluation through Fastly CDN with 60-minute TTL caching

**Ampli CLI Commands**:
- `ampli pull`: Download and generate strongly-typed tracking code from tracking plans
- `ampli status`: Validate implementation against tracking plan schemas
- `ampli status --is-merged`: Verify tracking plan deployment status

**SDK Integration Methods**:
- **Analytics**: `track()`, `identify()`, `revenue()`, `flush()`, `setUserId()`, `setDeviceId()`
- **Experiment**: `fetch()` (remote evaluation), `evaluate()` (local evaluation), `variant()`
- **Unified SDK**: `initAll()` for synchronized Analytics, Experiment, and Session Replay initialization

**Configuration Management**:
- Batch processing: `flushQueueSize`, `flushIntervalMillis`
- Privacy controls: `trackingOptions`, `setOptOut()`, `enableCoppaControl()`
- Data residency: `serverZone` configuration for EU compliance
- Storage management: `identityStorage` options (cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage, none)

The platform's comprehensive API ecosystem enables both real-time operational integration and batch analytical workflows, supporting everything from simple event tracking to complex enterprise data pipeline orchestration across the entire customer data lifecycle.
