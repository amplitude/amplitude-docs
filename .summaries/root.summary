Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables product teams to analyze user behavior, conduct feature experiments, manage customer data, and optimize product experiences. The platform integrates multiple products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP) into a unified ecosystem for data-driven product development.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The platform centers around **Analytics Core** as its foundation, providing event tracking, user segmentation, and behavioral analysis through specialized chart types. Event Segmentation measures event volume and property breakdowns, while Funnel Analysis tracks conversion through sequential steps. Retention Analysis measures user return behavior, and Cohort Analysis groups users by shared characteristics. Additional analysis types include User Sessions, Journeys (user path mapping), Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas (behavioral segments), Revenue LTV, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Data Tables, and Compass for comprehensive product insights.

**Amplitude Experiment** integrates directly with the analytics platform to provide feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities. It supports both remote and local evaluation modes with comprehensive APIs for flag management and variant assignment. The experiment platform includes advanced statistical techniques, experiment theory, workflow management, troubleshooting tools, and results analysis that leverage the underlying analytics data.

The **Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages the entire data lifecycle through source and destination catalogs, audience management, and warehouse-native capabilities. It connects the broader ecosystem through extensive integrations while supporting PII management for privacy compliance. **Session Replay** provides qualitative user session recordings that complement quantitative analytics, while **Guides and Surveys** enables in-product messaging and user feedback collection.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

The platform's data model is built on **Events** (user actions) and **Properties** (attributes describing events, users, or groups). Events are tracked through various SDKs and APIs, forming the basis for all analysis.

**Chart Types** represent different analytical approaches:
- *Event Segmentation*: Event volume measurement and property analysis
- *Funnel Analysis*: Sequential step conversion tracking
- *Retention Analysis*: User return behavior over time
- *Cohort Analysis*: User grouping by shared characteristics
- *Journeys*: User path mapping through product experiences
- *Personas*: Behavioral user segmentation

**Experimentation terminology** includes:
- *Feature Flags*: Configuration controls for feature rollouts
- *Variants*: Different experiment versions
- *Bucketing*: User assignment to experiment groups
- *Holdout Groups*: Control populations for measuring experiment impact
- *Mutex Groups*: Traffic allocation management preventing experiment overlap

**Data Management concepts** encompass:
- *Sources*: Data ingestion points from various platforms
- *Destinations*: Data activation endpoints for external tools
- *Audiences*: User segments synchronized to external platforms
- *Transformations*: Data processing and enrichment capabilities

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates extensively with external tools through comprehensive source and destination catalogs supporting hundreds of integrations across marketing, analytics, and business intelligence platforms. The CDP enables bi-directional data flow, allowing teams to collect data from various sources and activate insights through downstream tools.

The platform supports **multi-site configurations** with English and Japanese localizations and region-specific deployments including US and EU data residency options. A robust **partner ecosystem** extends functionality through technology provider partnerships across product development and marketing technology stacks.

## API Specifications and Technical Implementation

**Analytics APIs** provide programmatic access through REST endpoints at `/apis/analytics/` for event ingestion, user management, and data export capabilities.

**Experiment APIs** offer comprehensive experiment management:
- **Evaluation API**: `/v1/vardata` for variant assignments, `/v1/flags` for flag configurations
- **Management API**: CRUD operations for flags, experiments, deployments, mutex groups, and holdout groups
- **Authentication**: API keys for evaluation, bearer tokens for management

**SDK Coverage** spans multiple platforms:
- **Client-side**: Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal
- **Server-side**: Node.js, Python, Java, Go
- **Specialized**: Ampli (type-safe analytics), various experiment SDKs

**URL Patterns** follow consistent routing:
- Analytics SDKs: `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/`
- Experiment SDKs: `/sdks/experiment-sdks/`
- APIs: `/apis/{product}/`
- Charts and analysis: `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/`

The platform supports both real-time and batch data processing with comprehensive instrumentation guidance, migration tools, and troubleshooting resources. Administrative capabilities include account management, billing controls, single sign-on integration, and granular access controls across the entire platform ecosystem.
