Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform combines behavioral analytics, A/B testing, customer data management, and session replay capabilities into an integrated ecosystem designed for product teams, marketers, and data professionals.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

Amplitude's ecosystem consists of four primary product pillars that work together to provide end-to-end analytics and optimization capabilities:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the core behavioral analytics engine, featuring event-based tracking with multiple chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Pathfinder, and Journeys. The platform supports both individual user-level analysis and account-level reporting through the Accounts add-on, enabling group-level analytics for organizational structures like companies or teams.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides A/B testing and feature flagging capabilities with advanced statistical methodologies including sequential testing, mutual exclusion groups, and sophisticated targeting through behavioral cohorts. The platform integrates deeply with Analytics for experiment analysis and supports both client-side and server-side experimentation workflows.

**Amplitude Data** functions as the data governance and management layer, providing tracking plan creation, type-safe code generation through Ampli, data quality monitoring, and retroactive data transformations. The platform includes Autocapture functionality for automated event tracking and comprehensive data catalog management.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures user interactions for qualitative analysis, with configurable sampling rates and privacy controls. The feature integrates with Analytics charts and cohorts to provide contextual user behavior insights.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Data Concepts:**
- **Events**: User actions tracked with verb+noun naming conventions, representing discrete interactions
- **Event Properties**: Contextual data attached to specific events (maximum 20 properties per event)
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes describing user characteristics that update over time
- **Group Properties**: Account-level attributes for B2B analytics (requires Accounts add-on)
- **Amplitude ID**: Platform-generated unique identifier for user tracking
- **Device ID**: Platform-specific identifiers (IDFV for iOS, UUID for Android)
- **User ID**: Custom business-defined identifier for cross-device tracking

**Analytics Terminology:**
- **Monthly Tracked Users (MTU)**: Primary billing metric for active users
- **Behavioral Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments based on shared behaviors and actions
- **Session Timeout**: Configurable inactivity periods (5 minutes mobile, 30 minutes web)
- **Active Users**: Users triggering non-inactive events within specified timeframes
- **Retention**: User return behavior analysis across various time intervals
- **Stickiness**: Engagement frequency measurement showing usage intensity

**Experimentation Framework:**
- **Feature Flags**: Boolean toggles for feature rollouts and targeting
- **Variants**: Different versions of features or experiences in experiments
- **Exposure Events**: Automatic tracking when users encounter experiment variations
- **Sequential Testing**: Statistical methodology providing always-valid p-values
- **Mutual Exclusion Groups**: Preventing cross-experiment contamination

**Data Management:**
- **Tracking Plans**: Structured schemas defining events, properties, and validation rules
- **Ampli**: Code generation tool creating type-safe SDK wrappers from tracking plans
- **Autocapture**: Automated tracking of user interactions without manual instrumentation
- **Transformations**: Retroactive data modifications including event merging and property renaming

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude operates within a comprehensive analytics and optimization ecosystem through multiple integration layers:

**Data Collection and Instrumentation** supports multiple ingestion methods including Browser SDK, iOS/Android SDKs, HTTP API v2, server-side SDKs (Node.js, Python, Java, Go), and third-party integrations through the source catalog. The platform provides unified cross-platform instrumentation strategies and separate platform approaches depending on user crossover analysis needs.

**Data Activation and Distribution** occurs through the destination catalog featuring over 100 integrations spanning marketing automation (Braze, Customer.io, Klaviyo), advertising networks (Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads), experimentation platforms (Optimizely, LaunchDarkly), and data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Amazon S3). The platform supports both real-time event streaming and scheduled cohort synchronization.

**Enterprise Integration** includes SCIM 2.0 provisioning for user management, SSO configuration, webhook endpoints for real-time notifications, and comprehensive APIs for programmatic access. The platform maintains SOC2 Type 2, GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA compliance with configurable data retention policies and privacy controls.

**Developer Ecosystem** encompasses SDKs for web (Browser), mobile (iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity), and server-side platforms (Node.js, Python, Java, Go), along with specialized tools like the Chrome Instrumentation Explorer, Ampli CLI for code generation, and comprehensive debugging interfaces.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Primary Data Ingestion APIs:**

- `GET profile-api.amplitude.com/v1/userprofile` - Comprehensive user profile retrieval
- Dashboard REST API endpoints for analytics queries and chart data
- Behavioral Cohorts API (v3/v5) for user segment management

**Management and Governance APIs:**
- Taxonomy API for schema management and event/property CRUD operations
- User Privacy API for GDPR/CCPA compliance and data deletion
- SCIM 2.0 API for enterprise user provisioning
- Releases API for product change tracking and correlation analysis

**Authentication and Configuration:**
- API key authentication for ingestion endpoints
- HTTP Basic authentication for retrieval and management APIs
- Secret key authentication for User Profile API

**SDK Configuration Options:**
Key configuration parameters include `deferInitialization` for consent management, `disableCookies` for cookieless tracking, `setOptOut()` and `enableTracking()` for privacy controls, `batchEvents` and `eventUploadThreshold` for performance optimization, and `autocapture` settings for automated event collection.

The platform implements comprehensive rate limiting, supports both real-time and batch processing workflows, and provides extensive debugging capabilities through detailed response codes, real-time event verification, and sophisticated deduplication logic using event ID/client event time/device ID matching.
