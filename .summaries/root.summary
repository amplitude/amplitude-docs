Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables product teams to understand user behavior, optimize experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of several interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP), all unified around event-based tracking and user journey analysis.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem is built on a foundation of **Analytics** as the core product, with specialized modules extending its capabilities:

**Analytics Core**: The central hub featuring multiple chart types for behavioral analysis including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Compass, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Revenue LTV, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Data Tables, and Experiment Results. These charts work together to provide comprehensive user behavior insights across the entire customer lifecycle.

**Amplitude Experiment**: A feature flagging and A/B testing platform that integrates deeply with Analytics for experiment analysis. It includes advanced techniques, experiment theory, workflow management, troubleshooting capabilities, and "under the hood" technical documentation. Web Experimentation provides client-side testing capabilities with visual editing tools.

**Session Replay**: Captures and replays user sessions to provide qualitative insights that complement quantitative analytics data.

**Guides and Surveys**: An in-product messaging and feedback collection system that enables teams to gather user insights and guide user experiences.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)**: Manages data flow through Sources (data ingestion), Destinations (data activation), Audiences (user segmentation), and warehouse-native capabilities for organizations using modern data stacks.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Event Segmentation**: The foundational chart type for analyzing how users perform specific events over time, with segmentation by user properties and behaviors.

**Funnel Analysis**: Tracks user progression through sequential steps to identify conversion rates and drop-off points in user journeys.

**Cohort Analysis**: Groups users by shared characteristics or behaviors for comparative analysis over time, particularly prominent in Retention Analysis charts.

**User Journey Mapping**: Visualizes the paths users take through products, implemented through the Journeys chart type.

**Feature Flags**: Boolean toggles that control feature visibility and experiment variants, managed through Amplitude Experiment.

**Amplitude Query Language (AQL)**: The underlying query system that powers chart creation and data analysis across the platform.

**Instrumentation**: The process of implementing event tracking through various SDKs and APIs to capture user behavior data.

**Ampli**: A type-safe wrapper that ensures consistent event tracking implementation across development teams and platforms.

**Behavioral Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments based on actions users have or haven't performed, used for targeting and analysis.

**Revenue LTV**: Customer lifetime value analysis that connects user behavior to business outcomes and revenue impact.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude operates as a central nervous system for product intelligence, integrating with the broader technology stack through multiple touchpoints:

**Data Integration Layer**: The Source Catalog and Destination Catalog provide pre-built integrations with hundreds of tools including CDPs (Segment, mParticle), marketing platforms (Braze, Iterable), data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery), and business intelligence tools. The platform supports both real-time streaming and batch data synchronization.

**Development Ecosystem**: Comprehensive SDK support across platforms including Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine. Each SDK provides consistent event tracking capabilities while accommodating platform-specific requirements.

**Enterprise Infrastructure**: Single Sign-On (SSO) integration, account management capabilities, billing and usage monitoring, and administrative controls ensure enterprise-grade security and governance.

**Partner Ecosystem**: Strategic partnerships extend Amplitude's capabilities through specialized integrations and joint solutions, documented in the Partners collection.

**Migration Support**: Dedicated migration documentation helps organizations transition from other analytics platforms while preserving historical data and maintaining business continuity.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Analytics API**: Primary REST API for querying chart data, managing projects, and accessing behavioral insights at `/apis/analytics/`

**Experiment APIs**: Dedicated endpoints for feature flag management, experiment configuration, and results analysis at `/apis/experiment/`

**Guides and Surveys API**: Enables programmatic control of in-product messaging and survey deployment at `/apis/guides-and-surveys/`

**SDK Implementation Routes**: Platform-specific documentation and implementation guides available at `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/` for each supported development environment

**Chart-Specific Endpoints**: Each analytics chart type has dedicated API access patterns, documented under `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/`

**Data Management APIs**: Source and destination management, audience synchronization, and warehouse-native operations accessible through the CDP API layer

The platform emphasizes developer experience through comprehensive documentation, code examples, troubleshooting guides, and FAQ resources. Multi-language support includes Japanese translations, and the academy content provides educational resources for teams adopting the platform. The architecture supports both cloud-hosted and warehouse-native deployments, accommodating diverse organizational data strategies and compliance requirements.
