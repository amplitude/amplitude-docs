## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Analytics Concepts:**
- **Events** - User actions or system occurrences tracked within applications
- **Properties** - Attributes associated with events or users that provide context
- **Segments** - Filtered subsets of users or events based on specific criteria
- **Cohorts** - Groups of users who share common characteristics or behaviors
- **Funnels** - Sequential user journey analysis showing conversion rates between steps
- **Retention** - Analysis of user return behavior over time periods

**Identity and Session Management:**
- **User ID** - Unique identifier for authenticated users across sessions and devices
- **Device ID** - Anonymous identifier for tracking users before authentication
- **Session ID** - Temporary identifier for individual user sessions
- **Amplitude ID** - Internal user identifier that unifies User ID and Device ID

**Data Architecture:**
- **Sources** - Systems that send data into Amplitude (SDKs, APIs, third-party integrations)
- **Destinations** - External systems that receive data from Amplitude
- **Transformations** - Data processing rules applied during ingestion or export
- **Taxonomies** - Organizational structures for categorizing events and properties

**Experimentation Terminology:**
- **Feature Flags** - Boolean toggles that control feature availability
- **Variants** - Different versions of features being tested in experiments
- **Allocation** - Percentage of users assigned to experiment variants
- **Statistical Significance** - Confidence level in experiment results
- **Lift** - Percentage improvement of variant over control
