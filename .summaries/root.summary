Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics platform that provides event-based tracking and analysis capabilities across web, mobile, and server environments. The platform enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights.

## Core Product Architecture and Features

The platform is built around several interconnected product areas:

**Analytics Core**: The foundational analytics engine processes user events and properties through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Compass, Journeys, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Personas, Revenue LTV, Data Tables, and Experiment Results. These charts are accessible through a unified interface and support both real-time and historical analysis.

**Amplitude Experiment**: A comprehensive feature flagging and A/B testing platform that includes experiment theory, advanced techniques, workflow management, troubleshooting capabilities, and "under the hood" technical documentation. The experiment system integrates directly with analytics for results measurement and includes dedicated APIs and SDKs.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)**: Manages data flow through Sources, Audiences, and a comprehensive Destination Catalog with integration taxonomies. The CDP includes warehouse-native capabilities and PII integration management for privacy compliance.

**Session Replay**: Provides user session recording and playback capabilities integrated with the broader analytics platform for behavioral analysis.

**Guides and Surveys**: An in-product messaging and feedback collection system with dedicated APIs for programmatic management.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

The platform follows a hierarchical content organization structure with collections representing different product areas and feature sets. Key relationships include:

**SDK Ecosystem**: Multiple platform-specific SDKs (Android, iOS, Browser, Flutter, React Native, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, Unreal) all integrate with the core Analytics API, while Experiment SDKs provide feature flag functionality. The Ampli wrapper provides type-safe analytics implementation across platforms.

**Chart Integration**: All chart types (Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention, etc.) share common analytics infrastructure but provide specialized visualization and analysis capabilities. Legacy charts are maintained for backward compatibility.

**API Ecosystem**: Separate API collections for Analytics, Experiment, and Guides and Surveys, each with dedicated endpoints and authentication mechanisms.

**Administrative Structure**: Account Management, Billing and Use, and Single Sign-on collections support enterprise deployment with centralized administration capabilities.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Analytics Concepts**:
- **Events**: User actions tracked with associated properties and timestamps
- **Charts**: Visualization and analysis tools for different analytical use cases
- **Cohorts**: User segments based on behavioral criteria (Audiences)
- **Funnels**: Multi-step conversion analysis workflows
- **Retention**: User return behavior measurement over time periods

**Experiment Terminology**:
- **Feature Flags**: Boolean toggles for feature activation/deactivation
- **Variants**: Different versions of features being tested
- **Allocation**: User assignment to experiment groups
- **Statistical Significance**: Confidence levels for experiment results

**Data Management**:
- **Sources**: Data input mechanisms and integrations
- **Destinations**: Data output targets and integrations
- **Instrumentation**: Code implementation for event tracking
- **Taxonomy**: Organized event and property naming conventions

**Platform Structure**:
- **Organizations**: Top-level account containers
- **Projects**: Data collection and analysis environments
- **Spaces**: Content organization and collaboration areas
- **Collections**: Documentation and feature groupings

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude operates as a comprehensive analytics platform with multiple integration points:

**Multi-Site Support**: The platform supports both English (`en`) and Japanese (`jp`) localization with site-specific content propagation and routing structures.

**Partner Ecosystem**: Dedicated partner integrations and marketplace with categorized integration types for data sources and destinations.

**Migration Support**: Comprehensive migration documentation for transitioning from other analytics platforms with specific guidance and tooling.

**Academy Content**: Educational resources and training materials for platform adoption and best practices.

**Enterprise Features**: Advanced administrative capabilities including SSO integration, billing management, and account-level controls for large-scale deployments.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Primary API Collections**:
- **Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/{slug}`): Core event ingestion and data retrieval
- **Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/{slug}`): Feature flag management and experiment configuration
- **Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/{slug}`): In-product messaging and feedback collection

**SDK Routes**:
- Analytics SDKs: `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/{slug}` (Browser, iOS, Android, etc.)
- Experiment SDKs: `/sdks/experiment-sdks/{slug}`
- Ampli wrapper: `/sdks/ampli/{slug}`

**Chart-Specific Endpoints**:
Each chart type maintains dedicated routes under `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/{slug}` for specialized documentation and configuration guidance.

**Administrative APIs**:
- Account management: `/admin/account-management/{slug}`
- Billing: `/admin/billing-use/{slug}`
- SSO configuration: `/admin/single-sign-on/{slug}`

The platform uses a mount-based architecture where many collections reference specific mount IDs, indicating a modular content management system that allows for flexible content organization and reuse across different product areas. Preview targets are consistently configured with entry-level URLs and refresh capabilities for real-time content updates.
