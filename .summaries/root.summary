Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP), all unified under a cohesive ecosystem for product intelligence.

## Core Product Architecture and Relationships

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational layer, providing event tracking, user segmentation, and behavioral analysis through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Revenue LTV, Journeys, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, and Experiment Results. These charts enable teams to understand user behavior patterns, conversion flows, and product performance metrics.

**Amplitude Experiment** integrates deeply with Analytics to provide feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities. It includes advanced techniques, experiment theory, workflow management, and troubleshooting tools. The platform supports sophisticated experimentation through variant management, statistical analysis, and result interpretation within the broader analytics context.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user sessions to provide qualitative insights that complement quantitative analytics data. This enables teams to understand not just what users do, but how they interact with products at a granular level.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** delivers in-product user experience optimization through contextual guidance and feedback collection, leveraging analytics data for targeting and personalization.

The **Customer Data Platform (CDP)** unifies data management through Sources, Destinations, Audiences, and warehouse-native capabilities, creating a centralized data infrastructure that feeds all other platform components.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** represent user actions tracked within applications, forming the foundation of all analytics. **Properties** are attributes associated with events or users that enable segmentation and analysis. **Cohorts** are user segments based on shared characteristics or behaviors.

**Funnels** track user progression through defined steps, while **Retention** measures user return behavior over time. **Lifecycle** categorizes users based on their engagement patterns (New, Current, Dormant, Resurrected).

**Amplitude IDs** serve as unique user identifiers across the platform. **Device IDs** and **User IDs** provide different levels of user tracking granularity. **Session IDs** group related user actions within time-bounded interactions.

**Taxonomies** organize and categorize integrations and content. **Blueprints** provide standardized tracking implementations. **Governance** ensures data quality and consistency across implementations.

**Experiments** encompass feature flags, A/B tests, and multi-armed bandit configurations. **Variants** represent different versions of features or experiences being tested. **Allocation** determines user assignment to experiment variants.

## SDK and API Ecosystem

The platform provides comprehensive SDK support across multiple platforms and languages:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser (JavaScript), iOS (Swift), Android (Kotlin/Java), React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal, Node.js, Python, Java, and Go implementations. Each SDK follows consistent patterns for initialization, event tracking, user identification, and configuration management.

**Experiment SDKs** provide feature flag evaluation and variant assignment across the same platform ecosystem, with tight integration to Analytics SDKs for seamless data collection.

**Ampli** serves as a type-safe wrapper that generates strongly-typed tracking libraries based on predefined tracking plans, ensuring implementation consistency and reducing tracking errors.

Key API endpoints include:
- Analytics API (`/apis/analytics/`) for event ingestion and data retrieval
- Experiment APIs (`/apis/experiment/`) for flag management and variant assignment
- Guides and Surveys API (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) for experience delivery

Common SDK methods include `init()` for initialization, `track()` for event logging, `identify()` for user association, and `setUserProperties()` for user attribute management.

## Data Management and Integration Framework

The **Source Catalog** provides pre-built integrations for data ingestion from various platforms, while the **Destination Catalog** enables data activation across marketing, analytics, and operational tools. Both catalogs support extensive integration categories including advertising, analytics, attribution, CRM, email marketing, and data warehouses.

**Warehouse-native Amplitude** enables direct analysis of data stored in customer data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift) without data movement. This approach maintains data residency while providing full Amplitude analytics capabilities.

**PII Integrations** handle personally identifiable information with appropriate privacy controls and compliance measures.

## Administrative and Operational Framework

**Account Management** encompasses user provisioning, role assignment, and organizational structure management. **Single Sign-On (SSO)** provides enterprise authentication integration with SAML and OAuth providers.

**Billing and Use** tracking monitors platform consumption across events, MTUs (Monthly Tracked Users), and feature usage to ensure compliance with subscription limits.

The platform implements role-based access control with permissions for viewing, editing, and publishing across different product areas. **Navigation titles** organize content hierarchically (analytics, data, experiment, apis, etc.) for intuitive user experience.

## Localization and Global Support

The platform supports internationalization through multiple site configurations (en, jp) with propagation controls for content distribution. **Japanese Translation** provides localized documentation and interface elements for Japanese users.

Date behavior controls manage content visibility based on publication timing, while preview targets enable content validation before publication.

## Migration and Onboarding Support

**Migration** tools and documentation facilitate transitions from other analytics platforms, providing mapping guides, data import utilities, and implementation assistance.

**Get Started** resources include quick-start guides, implementation checklists, and best practice recommendations for new users.

**Academy Content** provides educational materials, training resources, and certification programs for platform mastery.

**FAQ and Troubleshooting** sections address common implementation challenges and provide resolution guidance across all platform components.

The platform's architecture emphasizes interconnectedness, where analytics data informs experimentation decisions, experiment results drive product iterations, session replay provides qualitative context, and guides/surveys enable direct user engagement—all supported by a robust data infrastructure and comprehensive developer tooling ecosystem.
