Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to collect, analyze, and act on user behavior data across web, mobile, and server-side applications. The platform combines real-time analytics, A/B testing, feature flagging, customer data management, and user engagement tools into an integrated ecosystem designed to support data-driven product development and optimization.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The platform is structured around four core product areas that work in concert:

**Analytics Core** serves as the foundational layer, providing event tracking, user behavior analysis, and visualization through specialized chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, Cohort Analysis (Lifecycle), User Journey mapping (Journeys), Revenue LTV analysis, and behavioral metrics (Stickiness, Engagement Matrix). This core engine processes all user interaction data and makes it available for analysis across other platform components.

**Amplitude Experiment** builds on the analytics foundation to deliver feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities. It leverages the same event data to measure experiment impact through dedicated Experiment Results charts, providing statistical analysis and experiment theory implementation with real-time result tracking.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages the complete data lifecycle through Sources and Destinations catalogs, Audiences creation, and warehouse-native integrations. It orchestrates both real-time and batch data processing workflows, ensuring data quality and enabling activation across external systems.

**User Engagement Suite** includes Amplitude Session Replay for qualitative user session analysis, and Amplitude Guides and Surveys for in-product user engagement and feedback collection, creating a closed loop between analysis and user interaction.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Analytics Terminology
- **Events**: Discrete user actions tracked through the platform, forming the atomic unit of all analysis
- **Properties**: Metadata associated with events (event properties) or users (user properties) that enable segmentation and filtering
- **Segments**: Dynamically filtered subsets of users or events used for targeted analysis
- **Cohorts**: Groups of users defined by shared characteristics, behaviors, or time-based criteria
- **Funnels**: Sequential analysis of user journeys showing conversion rates between defined steps
- **Retention**: Measurement of user return behavior over specified time periods, indicating product stickiness

### Experimentation Framework
- **Feature Flags**: Boolean or multi-variant toggles controlling feature availability and behavior
- **Variants**: Different versions of features or experiences distributed to experiment participants
- **Allocation**: Percentage-based distribution of users across experiment variants
- **Statistical Significance**: Confidence level in experiment results, typically measured at 95% or 99%
- **Lift**: Percentage improvement of treatment variants compared to control groups

### Data Infrastructure
- **Sources**: Input connectors that ingest data from various platforms, applications, and third-party services
- **Destinations**: Output connectors that send processed data and audiences to external systems
- **Transformations**: Data processing rules applied during ingestion to clean, enrich, or modify incoming data
- **Audiences**: Dynamically updated user segments based on behavioral criteria, synchronized across platforms
- **Warehouse-native**: Direct integration approach that processes data within cloud data warehouses

### Technical Implementation
- **Instrumentation**: Implementation of tracking code across applications using SDKs or APIs
- **Autocapture**: Automated event collection that captures user interactions without manual instrumentation
- **Ampli**: Type-safe wrapper providing strongly-typed event tracking generated from centralized tracking plans
- **Agents**: Automated components handling data collection, processing, and synchronization tasks

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude operates as a central nervous system for product analytics, integrating with enterprise data infrastructure through multiple connection points. The platform maintains warehouse integrations with Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, and other cloud data platforms, enabling bidirectional data flow and warehouse-native processing capabilities.

The marketing technology integration layer connects with advertising platforms, email marketing tools, and customer engagement systems, allowing for audience activation and campaign measurement. Product development workflows integrate through feature management platforms, CI/CD pipelines, and development tools, creating seamless connections between analysis and implementation.

Privacy and compliance capabilities support GDPR, CCPA, and other regulatory requirements through configurable data residency, user consent management, and PII handling controls, ensuring the platform can operate within various regulatory environments.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

### Core Analytics APIs
- **HTTP v2 API** (`/2/httpapi`): Primary real-time event ingestion endpoint supporting high-volume data collection
- **Batch API**: Bulk event upload system for historical data import and high-volume batch processing
- **Export API**: Comprehensive data extraction system for external analysis, backup, and data portability
- **Cohort API**: Programmatic audience management enabling automated segment creation and synchronization

### Experimentation APIs
- **Flag Evaluation API**: Real-time feature flag resolution and variant assignment with sub-100ms response times
- **Assignment API**: Experiment enrollment tracking and user assignment management
- **Results API**: Programmatic access to experiment statistics, confidence intervals, and outcome metrics

### Data Management APIs
- **Taxonomy API**: Event and property schema management for maintaining data governance
- **User API**: Individual user data management supporting privacy compliance and data deletion requests
- **Project API**: Organizational structure and access control management

### SDK Architecture
The platform supports comprehensive SDK implementations across development environments:

**Analytics SDKs** provide consistent APIs across Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine platforms, each optimized for platform-specific performance and integration patterns.

**Experiment SDKs** deliver feature flagging capabilities with local evaluation, caching, and fallback mechanisms to ensure reliable feature delivery even during network interruptions.

### Command Line Tools
**Ampli CLI** provides development workflow integration with commands including:
- `ampli pull`: Downloads tracking plan schemas and generates type-safe code
- `ampli push`: Validates and uploads tracking implementations
- `ampli status`: Verifies implementation compliance with tracking plans

The platform's architecture supports both real-time and batch processing workflows, enabling immediate insights for operational decisions while maintaining comprehensive historical analysis capabilities. This dual-mode approach ensures the platform can serve both tactical optimization needs and strategic product planning requirements within a unified analytics framework.
