## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Analytics Concepts:**
- **Events** - User actions tracked within applications (clicks, page views, purchases)
- **Properties** - Metadata associated with events and users
- **Cohorts** - User segments based on shared characteristics or behaviors
- **Funnels** - Sequential user journey analysis
- **Retention** - User return behavior measurement
- **Segmentation** - Event volume and property analysis over time

**Experimentation Terminology:**
- **Feature Flags** - Dynamic configuration controls for application features
- **Variants** - Different versions of features being tested
- **Statistical Significance** - Confidence level in experiment results
- **Lift** - Performance improvement measurement between variants

**Data Infrastructure:**
- **Instrumentation** - Code implementation for data collection
- **Schema** - Data structure and validation rules
- **Taxonomy** - Standardized naming conventions and categorization
- **Real-time vs Batch Processing** - Data ingestion and processing modes

**Identity Management:**
- **User ID** - Unique identifier for authenticated users
- **Device ID** - Anonymous device-level tracking identifier
- **Amplitude ID** - Platform-generated unique user identifier
- **Group Properties** - Organization or account-level attributes
