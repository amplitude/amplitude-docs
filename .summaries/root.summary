Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Core Product Architecture

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, offering sophisticated charting capabilities through specialized visualization tools. The platform includes Event Segmentation for analyzing user actions, Funnel Analysis for conversion tracking, Retention Analysis for user lifecycle insights, Cohort Analysis through Lifecycle charts, User Journey mapping via Journeys, Engagement Matrix for behavioral analysis, Impact Analysis for feature assessment, Revenue LTV for monetization insights, Stickiness analysis for engagement patterns, User Sessions tracking, Personas for user segmentation, and Data Tables for raw data exploration. Legacy chart types are maintained for backward compatibility.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced statistical methods. The platform supports experiment design through workflow management, statistical analysis via experiment theory documentation, advanced techniques for complex testing scenarios, and comprehensive troubleshooting tools. Results are analyzed through dedicated Experiment Results charts integrated with the analytics platform.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user sessions to provide qualitative insights into user behavior, complementing the quantitative analytics data.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** delivers in-product user engagement through contextual guides, feedback collection surveys, and resource centers for user support and onboarding.

## Multi-Platform SDK Ecosystem

The platform supports comprehensive instrumentation through language and platform-specific SDKs:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser SDK (`@amplitude/analytics-browser`), Android SDK, iOS SDK, React Native SDK, Flutter SDK, Node.js SDK, Python SDK, Java SDK, Go SDK, Unity SDK, and Unreal SDK. Each SDK provides platform-optimized event tracking, user identification, and data collection capabilities.

**Experiment SDKs** enable feature flag evaluation and experiment participation across all supported platforms, with client-side and server-side implementations.

**Ampli** serves as a type-safe wrapper that generates strongly-typed tracking libraries from Amplitude's Data taxonomy, ensuring consistent and validated event instrumentation across development teams.

## Customer Data Platform (CDP)

The CDP provides comprehensive data management through **Sources** for data ingestion from various platforms, **Destinations** for data activation and export, **Audiences** for user segmentation and targeting, and **Warehouse-native Amplitude** for direct data warehouse integration. The platform includes extensive **Source Catalog** and **Destination Catalog** with pre-built integrations, plus **PII Integrations** for privacy-compliant data handling.

## API Infrastructure

Amplitude provides comprehensive API access through:

**Analytics API** for programmatic data querying, event ingestion, and chart configuration
**Experiment APIs** for feature flag management, experiment configuration, and results retrieval  
**Guides and Surveys API** for programmatic content management and analytics access

All APIs follow RESTful conventions with authentication, rate limiting, and comprehensive documentation.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Account Management** provides organization-level controls, user provisioning, and access management. **Billing and Use** tracking offers usage monitoring and cost optimization tools. **Single Sign-on (SSO)** integration supports enterprise authentication systems for secure access control.

## Developer Resources and Support

The platform includes comprehensive **Get Started** documentation for onboarding, **Migration** guides for platform transitions, **FAQ and Troubleshooting** resources, and **Academy Content** for educational materials. **Partners** documentation covers third-party integrations and marketplace solutions.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** are user actions tracked within applications, forming the foundation of all analytics
**Properties** are attributes associated with events or users that enable segmentation and analysis
**Cohorts** are user groups defined by shared characteristics or behaviors
**Funnels** represent sequential user flows with conversion tracking between steps
**Segments** are filtered subsets of events or users based on specific criteria
**Experiments** are controlled tests comparing different user experiences
**Feature Flags** are toggles that control feature availability for different user groups
**Variants** are different versions of features or experiences in experiments
**Instrumentation** refers to the implementation of tracking code within applications

## Integration Patterns

The platform supports multiple integration approaches including direct SDK implementation, server-side tracking, client-side tracking, hybrid implementations, and third-party tool integrations through partners. The **Agents** system provides automated data collection and processing capabilities.

## Localization and Global Support

The platform includes **Japanese Translation** support with localized documentation and interfaces, indicating broader internationalization capabilities for global deployments.

## Data Governance and Privacy

**PII Integrations** provide privacy-compliant data handling with encryption, anonymization, and regulatory compliance features. The platform supports data residency requirements and privacy regulations across different jurisdictions.

This comprehensive ecosystem enables organizations to implement complete product analytics workflows from data collection through analysis, experimentation, and user engagement, with enterprise-grade security, scalability, and integration capabilities.
