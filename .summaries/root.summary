Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables product teams to understand user behavior, optimize conversion funnels, and run sophisticated A/B tests across web and mobile applications. The platform is built around event-based tracking with a robust ecosystem of interconnected products for analytics, experimentation, data management, and user journey optimization.

## Core Product Architecture and Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem consists of four primary product areas that work together to provide end-to-end product intelligence:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the central analytics engine, featuring multiple chart types including Event Segmentation for behavioral analysis, Funnel Analysis for conversion tracking, Retention Analysis for engagement measurement, User Sessions for session-based metrics, and Pathfinder for user journey visualization. The platform supports both individual user-level and account-level reporting through the Accounts add-on, enabling B2B organizations to analyze customer accounts alongside individual user behaviors.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides A/B testing and feature flagging capabilities with sequential testing methodology, mutual exclusion groups, and statistical significance calculations. The platform integrates deeply with the analytics engine to provide experiment results analysis and supports both client-side and server-side experimentation workflows.

**Amplitude Data** handles data governance and tracking plan management, enforcing schema validation, managing instrumentation limits, and providing event/property blocking, hiding, and deletion capabilities. This product ensures data quality and compliance across the entire analytics ecosystem.

**Session Replay** bridges quantitative analytics with qualitative user experience insights by providing synchronized event streams with actual user session recordings, enabling comprehensive analysis from high-level metrics to granular interaction patterns.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events and Properties**: Events represent discrete user actions (e.g., "Button Clicked"), while event properties provide contextual data (e.g., button_name: "Sign Up"). User properties describe persistent user attributes across sessions. The platform supports up to 2,000 event types, 2,000 event properties, and 1,000 user properties per project.

**User Identification System**: The platform uses multiple identifier types including User ID (custom identifier), Device ID (SDK-generated), and Amplitude ID (internal unique identifier). User merging combines anonymous and known user profiles to create unified user journeys.

**Sessions**: Time-bounded user activity periods with configurable timeout windows (30 minutes web, 5 minutes mobile by default). Session tracking differs from other platforms in timeout behavior and midnight rollover handling.

**Behavioral Cohorts**: Dynamic and static user segments defined by behavioral criteria, available as behavioral (recalculated) or static (fixed membership) types. Cohorts can span 3-year date ranges and integrate across all chart types.

**Group Types and Account-Level Reporting**: The Accounts add-on supports up to 5 group types per project with event-level and user-level group associations, enabling analysis of organizational hierarchies and B2B customer accounts.

**Statistical Testing**: Amplitude Experiment uses sequential testing with always-valid p-values, while Funnel Analysis charts use two-tailed T-tests. Both maintain 5% false positive rates with different minimum sample requirements.

**Conversion Windows and Attribution**: Time periods within which funnel steps must be completed, with support for first-touch and last-touch attribution models for marketing channel analysis.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude operates as the central hub in a comprehensive product intelligence ecosystem with extensive integration capabilities:

**Data Infrastructure**: Multiple ingestion methods including HTTP V2 API for real-time events (30 events/second throttling), Batch Event Upload API for high-volume data, Export API for JSON format data extraction, and Behavioral Cohorts API for programmatic cohort management.

**SDK Ecosystem**: Comprehensive SDK support including Browser SDK, Android SDK, iOS SDK, React Native SDK, Flutter SDK, Unity SDK, Unreal SDK, Node.js SDK, Python SDK, Java SDK, and Go SDK, each with platform-specific optimizations and features.

**Third-Party Integrations**: Deep integrations with Segment (cloud-mode and device-mode), mobile attribution providers (Appsflyer, Adjust, Branch, Singular), data warehouses (Snowflake, Amazon S3), and collaboration tools (Slack, Confluence, Jira, Notion, Miro, Google Workspace).

**Collaboration and Workflow**: Spaces for content organization, Notebooks for analytical storytelling, dashboard sharing via public links or embed codes, and extensive third-party integrations that transform analytical insights into actionable business intelligence.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Core Analytics APIs**:
- `/2/httpapi` - HTTP V2 API for real-time event ingestion
- `/batch` - Batch Event Upload API for bulk data processing
- `/export` - Export API for raw event data extraction
- `/cohort/{cohort_id}/users` - Behavioral Cohorts API with propKeys parameter support

**Experiment APIs**:
- Experiment Management API for flag and experiment configuration
- Assignment API for user variant assignment
- Results API for experiment performance data

**Data Management APIs**:
- Group Identify API (`/groupidentify`) for account-level property management
- Identity API for user profile management
- Attribution API for mobile attribution event processing

**SDK Configuration Methods**:
- `amplitude.init()` for SDK initialization across platforms
- `amplitude.setServerUrl()` for domain proxy configuration
- Platform-specific methods for session tracking, user identification, and event batching

## Chart Types and Analysis Capabilities

The platform provides sophisticated analytical tools through multiple specialized chart types:

**Event Segmentation**: Core behavioral analysis with support for 100 breakdown table values and multiple comparison methodologies.

**Funnel Analysis**: Conversion tracking with three ordering modes (This Order, Any Order, Exact Order), Microscope integration for conversion driver analysis, and A/B testing integration with statistical significance calculations.

**Retention Analysis**: User engagement measurement over time with cohort-based analysis and configurable retention windows.

**Data Tables**: Multi-dimensional analysis supporting 10,000 baseline limits and complex property breakdowns.

**Specialized Charts**: Compass for correlation analysis, Lifecycle for user state tracking, Personas for user segmentation, Journeys for path analysis, Impact Analysis for feature impact measurement, Revenue LTV for monetization analysis, and Stickiness for engagement frequency analysis.

## Platform Limits and Enterprise Features

**Instrumentation Limits**: Monthly event volume limits vary by plan tier (Scholarship, Plus, Growth, Enterprise), with chart-specific limits including Event Segmentation's 100 breakdown values, Funnel Analysis's 300 group-by limits, and varying CSV export row restrictions.

**Enterprise Capabilities**: Advanced security controls, custom retention periods, enhanced API rate limits, account-level reporting, anomaly detection with Prophet-based algorithms, and enhanced collaboration controls for large-scale implementations.

**Compliance and Security**: SOC2 Type 2, GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA compliance with User Privacy API for GDPR compliance, Customer Trust Portal access, and Bug Bounty program for security vulnerability management.
