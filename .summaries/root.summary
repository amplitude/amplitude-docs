# Amplitude Product Documentation

## Product Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that helps businesses understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth. The platform enables data-driven decision making through tools for data collection, analysis, visualization, experimentation, and user engagement.

Key features include:
- Behavioral analytics
- User segmentation
- Funnel analysis
- Retention tracking
- A/B testing
- Feature flagging
- Customer journey mapping

These capabilities allow product teams to gain insights into user interactions, identify improvement opportunities, and measure the impact of product changes.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

Amplitude's platform consists of five interconnected products:

1. **Analytics** - Core analytics engine for processing and visualizing user behavior data
2. **Experiment** - Platform for A/B testing and feature flagging
3. **Data Management** - Tools for collecting, organizing, and activating user data
4. **Guides and Surveys** - In-product messaging and feedback collection
5. **Session Replay** - User session recording and analysis

The platform follows a data flow architecture:
- Data collection through SDKs or APIs
- Data processing, enrichment, and storage
- Data analysis via visualization tools
- Insight activation through experiments or integrations

Integration points between products create seamless workflows:
- Analytics segments can target specific users in Experiments
- Experiment configurations are delivered to SDKs
- User behavior data informs guide targeting
- Guide interaction data flows back to Analytics
