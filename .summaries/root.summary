# Amplitude Product Ecosystem

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that enables businesses to understand user behavior, optimize digital experiences, and make data-driven decisions. The platform provides robust capabilities for tracking user interactions, analyzing behavioral patterns, conducting experiments, and managing customer data.

The core components of Amplitude include:

- **Analytics** - The foundational analytics engine that processes user events and provides visualization tools for understanding user behavior through charts, funnels, retention analysis, and user journey mapping
- **Experiment** - A feature flagging and A/B testing platform that allows teams to test hypotheses and optimize user experiences
- **CDP (Customer Data Platform)** - A system for unifying, managing, and activating customer data across various touchpoints
- **Data** - Infrastructure for collecting, processing, and integrating data from multiple sources
- **SDKs** - Client and server libraries for various platforms to facilitate data collection and feature flag implementation
- **APIs** - Programmatic interfaces for accessing and manipulating data within the Amplitude ecosystem

## Product Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem functions as an integrated suite with the following relationships:

1. **Analytics Core** serves as the foundation of the platform, providing:
   - Event tracking and processing capabilities
   - Visualization tools including charts, funnels, and journey analysis
   - User segmentation and cohort analysis
   - Retention and engagement metrics

2. **Experiment** builds upon Analytics by:
   - Leveraging user segments defined in Analytics for targeted experiments
   - Using feature flags to control feature rollouts
   - Providing A/B testing capabilities to measure impact on key metrics
   - Offering SDKs that integrate with the Analytics SDKs for seamless implementation

3. **Data Management** components work together to ensure data quality and accessibility:
   - CDP orchestrates customer data across the platform
   - Source/Destination catalogs facilitate data integration with external systems
   - PII management ensures privacy compliance
   - Audiences functionality enables advanced user segmentation

4. **Implementation Options** span multiple platforms and approaches:
   - Client SDKs for Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity, and Unreal
   - Server SDKs for Node.js, Python, Java, and Go
   - Ampli SDK wrapper providing type-safe instrumentation
   - Direct API access for custom implementations

5. **Administrative Functions** handle operational aspects:
   - Account management for user permissions and access control
   - Billing and subscription management
   - SSO integration for enterprise authentication
   - Organization-level configuration settings

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event** - A discrete user action or system occurrence tracked in Amplitude (e.g., "Button Click", "Purchase Completed")
- **User** - An individual interacting with a product, identified by a unique ID
- **Session** - A period of continuous user engagement, typically ending after a period of inactivity
- **Cohort** - A group of users who share common characteristics or behaviors
- **Funnel** - A visualization of a series of steps users take toward a conversion goal, showing drop-offs between steps
- **Retention** - Measurement of how many users return to a product over specific time intervals
- **Feature Flag** - A toggle that enables or disables features or conducts experiments without code deployment
- **Variant** - A specific version of a feature in an experiment (e.g., control vs. treatment)
- **Source** - An origin point for data coming into Amplitude (e.g., website, mobile app, server)
- **Destination** - An external system where Amplitude sends processed data (e.g., CRM, marketing platform)
- **Instrumentation** - The process of implementing tracking code to collect user behavior data
- **Taxonomy** - The structured organization of events and properties to ensure consistent data collection

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude platform operates as a cohesive ecosystem with the following integration patterns:

1. **Data Flow Architecture**:
   - Raw data is collected via SDKs or direct API calls from client or server environments
   - This data is processed through the CDP or data pipeline for cleaning and enrichment
   - Processed data is stored and made available for analysis through the Analytics engine
   - Insights are visualized through various chart types and dashboards
   - Actions are taken based on insights through experiments or integrations with external systems

2. **Cross-Product Capabilities**:
   - User identity is maintained consistently across all Amplitude products
   - Data collected for analytics is immediately available for experimentation
   - Taxonomies and event definitions are shared across the platform
   - Experiment results are automatically reflected in analytics reports
   - Segments created in Analytics can be used for targeting in Experiment

3. **Integration Architecture**:
   - The Source catalog connects external data sources to bring data into Amplitude
   - The Destination catalog pushes processed data to external systems for activation
   - APIs provide programmatic access to all platform capabilities
   - SDKs offer streamlined implementation options for various client and server environments

## API Endpoints and Implementation

### Analytics API
- Base URL: `/apis/analytics/`
- Key endpoints include:
  - `/events` - For querying event data
  - `/users` - For managing user profiles
  - `/cohorts` - For creating and managing user segments
  - `/funnels` - For analyzing conversion paths

### Experiment API
- Base URL: `/apis/experiment/`
- Notable endpoints:
  - `/flags` - For managing feature flags
  - `/experiments` - For creating and monitoring experiments
  - `/variants` - For defining experiment variations
  - `/results` - For accessing experiment outcomes

### SDK Implementation Examples

**Client-side initialization:**
```javascript
amplitude.init('API_KEY', {
  optOut: false,
  userId: 'user@example.com',
  logLevel: 3
});
```

**Server-side initialization:**
```
AmplitudeClient client = Amplitude.getInstance().initialize(context, "API_KEY");
client.setUserId("user@example.com");
```

**Tracking events:**
```javascript
amplitude.track('Event Name', {
  property1: 'value1',
  property2: 'value2'
});
```

**Feature flag evaluation:**
```javascript
const variant = experiment.variant('flag-key', 'default-value');
if (variant === 'treatment') {
  // Show new feature
} else {
  // Show existing experience
}
```

### Command Line Tools
The Ampli CLI provides tools for code generation and tracking implementation:
```
ampli pull        # Pull tracking plan from Amplitude
ampli status      # Check implementation status
ampli generate    # Generate type-safe wrapper code
```

This tooling ensures consistent implementation of tracking across different parts of an application and helps maintain data quality throughout the analytics lifecycle.
