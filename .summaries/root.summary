Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive data-driven decision making across web and mobile applications through event-based tracking, advanced analytics, and integrated optimization tools.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform operates through four interconnected product areas that form a unified analytics and optimization ecosystem:

**Amplitude Analytics** functions as the foundational data collection and analysis engine, capturing user interactions through event-based tracking. The analytics suite provides 15+ specialized visualization types including Event Segmentation for behavioral analysis, Funnel Analysis for conversion optimization, Retention Analysis for engagement measurement, User Sessions for interaction patterns, Journeys for path analysis, Lifecycle for user progression tracking, Personas for behavioral clustering, Compass for metric correlation, Data Tables for raw data exploration, Engagement Matrix for feature adoption, Impact Analysis for causal inference, Stickiness for usage frequency, Revenue LTV for monetization analysis, and Legacy Charts for backward compatibility.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with statistical rigor, supporting controlled feature rollouts, multivariate testing, and advanced optimization techniques. The experimentation framework includes dedicated experiment theory documentation, implementation guides, and comprehensive troubleshooting resources for statistical analysis validation.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures complete user interaction sequences through video-like session recordings, providing visual context for quantitative analytics data and enabling detailed user experience optimization through behavioral observation.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user engagement through targeted messaging systems, interactive onboarding flows, and contextual feedback collection mechanisms, creating closed-loop optimization workflows.

## Data Infrastructure and Integration Architecture

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** capabilities provide enterprise-grade data management through four core components: Sources for multi-channel data ingestion, Destinations for data activation across marketing and product tools, Audiences for behavioral segmentation and targeting, and Warehouse-native Amplitude for direct data warehouse integration without data movement. The platform maintains extensive third-party integration catalogs with taxonomic categorization for streamlined implementation.

**Multi-Platform SDK Ecosystem** supports comprehensive instrumentation across technology stacks:
- **Mobile SDKs**: Native Android and iOS implementations, plus cross-platform Flutter, React Native, Unity, and Unreal Engine support
- **Web SDKs**: Browser JavaScript with framework-specific integrations for modern web development
- **Server-Side SDKs**: Node.js, Python, Java, and Go implementations for backend event tracking
- **Code Generation**: Ampli provides type-safe, auto-generated tracking libraries with compile-time validation

**API Infrastructure** exposes programmatic access through dedicated Analytics APIs for data querying, Experiment APIs for feature flag management, and Guides and Surveys APIs for in-product messaging automation, enabling custom integrations and workflow automation.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events and Properties** form the fundamental data model, where events represent discrete user actions and properties provide contextual attributes, creating the analytical foundation for all platform capabilities.

**Sessions and Users** establish identity resolution and continuity tracking through device ID and user ID management, enabling cross-platform user journey analysis and behavioral attribution.

**Cohorts and Audiences** represent user segmentation constructs, where cohorts define behavioral user groups for analysis and audiences enable activation and targeting across integrated platforms.

**Feature Flags and Experiments** encompass controlled rollout mechanisms with variant assignment, exposure tracking, statistical analysis, and results interpretation for product optimization.

**Charts and Dashboards** provide pre-configured visualization templates optimized for specific analytical use cases, from basic event tracking to complex multi-dimensional behavioral analysis.

**Integrations and Destinations** define third-party platform connections enabling bidirectional data flow, audience activation, and workflow automation across marketing, product, and analytics tool ecosystems.

## Administrative and Enterprise Capabilities

**Account Management** encompasses user provisioning, role-based access control (RBAC), and hierarchical organizational structure management with granular permission controls.

**Billing and Usage** tracking provides real-time usage monitoring, cost allocation, and consumption forecasting for enterprise resource management.

**Single Sign-On (SSO)** integration supports enterprise identity providers including SAML and OAuth implementations for centralized authentication management.

**Migration Tools** facilitate platform transitions with data portability, configuration mapping, and implementation validation for organizations transitioning from alternative analytics providers.

## Developer Resources and Implementation Support

**SDK Documentation** provides comprehensive implementation guides with code examples, best practices, and troubleshooting resources for each supported platform and framework.

**API Documentation** includes detailed endpoint specifications, authentication methods, rate limiting guidelines, and response schemas for programmatic integration.

**Framework Integrations** offer pre-built connectors for popular development frameworks, reducing implementation complexity and accelerating time-to-value.

**Academy Content** delivers structured educational materials, certification programs, and training resources for platform proficiency development across technical and business user personas.

**Partners Ecosystem** includes certified implementation partners, technology integrations, and consulting services, extending platform capabilities through third-party expertise and specialized tooling.

The platform maintains multi-language documentation support with Japanese localization and provides comprehensive troubleshooting resources, FAQ databases, and community support channels for implementation assistance and platform optimization guidance.
