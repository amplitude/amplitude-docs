Key capabilities include tracking user journeys across platforms, conducting experiments through A/B testing, and maintaining data quality through governance features.

## Product Ecosystem and Relationships

The Amplitude platform consists of several integrated products that work together to provide a complete analytics solution:

1. **Amplitude Data** serves as the foundation for data governance and management, offering:
   - Tracking plan definition and management
   - Data quality validation and monitoring
   - Schema management and enforcement
   - Data transformations and enrichment

2. **Amplitude Analytics** provides core analytics capabilities:
   - Multiple chart types including Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, and Event Segmentation
   - User journey visualization
   - Cohort analysis
   - Custom dashboards

3. **Experiment** functions as a feature experimentation platform with:
   - A/B testing capabilities
   - Feature flagging
   - Impact analysis
   - Experiment results visualization

4. **SDKs and Instrumentation** enable cross-platform data collection through:
   - Browser/Web SDK
   - Mobile SDKs (iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter)
   - Server-side SDKs (Node.js, Python, Java, Go)
   - Gaming SDKs (Unity, Unreal)
   - Ampli (type-safe SDK wrapper)

5. **Integrations** provide external system connectivity via:
   - Source Catalog (data import)
   - Destination Catalog (data export)
   - Warehouse-native connections

These components work together in a layered architecture, with data governance as the foundation, analytics capabilities for insight generation, and experimentation tools for testing and optimization.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Data Collection Terms
- **Events**: User actions or system occurrences tracked in the platform
- **Event Properties**: Contextual attributes attached to events
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes associated with users
- **Group Properties**: Attributes for organizational groupings
- **Tracking Plan**: Specification defining the structure of events and properties
- **Ampli**: Type-safe SDK wrapper generated from tracking plans

### Analytics Terms
- **Funnel Analysis**: Visualization of user progression through sequential steps
- **Retention Analysis**: Measurement of user return rates over time
- **Event Segmentation**: Breakdown of events by properties or user attributes
- **Journeys**: Visualization of user paths through a product
- **Personas**: User segmentation based on behavior patterns
- **Lifecycle**: Analysis of user stages (new, active, dormant)
- **Stickiness**: Measurement of user engagement frequency
- **Impact Analysis**: Assessment of feature impact on key metrics

### Experimentation Terms
- **Experiment**: Controlled test comparing variations
- **Feature Flag**: Toggle for enabling/disabling features
- **Experiment Results**: Statistical outcomes of experiments
- **Experiment Theory**: Methodological framework for testing

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude fits into a broader product ecosystem by connecting with various external systems:

1. **Data Sources**:
   - E-commerce platforms (Shopify)
   - CMS systems (WordPress)
   - Customer data platforms
   - Marketing automation tools

2. **Data Destinations**:
   - Data warehouses (Snowflake, Databricks)
   - Business intelligence tools
   - Marketing platforms
   - Customer engagement systems

3. **Warehouse-Native Integrations**:
   - Direct data loading via S3 or GCS
   - Keyless integrations with data warehouses

This positions Amplitude as a central hub for product analytics that can both ingest data from various sources and export insights to downstream systems, creating a comprehensive data ecosystem.
