# Amplitude Product Ecosystem Overview

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics platform that helps organizations understand user behavior, optimize experiences, and drive business growth. The platform consists of several interconnected products and features that enable data collection, analysis, experimentation, and data management. The core components include Analytics, Data, Experiment, and various SDKs for different platforms.

## Product Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem consists of these primary product areas:

1. **Analytics** - The core analytics platform for visualizing and analyzing user behavior through various charts and reports
2. **Data** - Tools for data governance, planning, validation, and transformation
3. **Experiment** - A/B testing and feature experimentation capabilities
4. **SDKs** - Client and server libraries for different platforms to collect and send data to Amplitude
5. **APIs** - Programmatic interfaces for interacting with Amplitude services
6. **Admin** - Account management, billing, and organizational settings

These products work together to provide a complete analytics solution:
- **SDKs** collect data and send it to Amplitude
- **Data** validates and transforms the incoming information
- **Analytics** provides visualization and analysis capabilities
- **Experiment** uses the collected data to test hypotheses and optimize experiences

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### General Terms
- **Events** - User actions or occurrences tracked in Amplitude
- **Properties** - Attributes associated with events or users
- **Tracking Plan** - Specification of events, properties, and sources
- **Cohorts** - Groups of users who share common attributes or behaviors
- **Sessions** - Periods of continuous user activity

### Data-Related Terms
- **Event Properties** - Attributes specific to an event occurrence
- **User Properties** - Persistent attributes of individual users
- **Group Properties** - Attributes of organizations or accounts
- **Derived Properties** - Properties created using formulas
- **Lookup Tables** - Data structures for enriching properties

### Analytics-Related Terms
- **Charts** - Visualizations of analytics data (Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, etc.)
- **Journeys** - User path analysis tools
- **Personas** - User segmentation based on behavior patterns
- **Compass** - Automated insights discovery

### Experiment-Related Terms
- **Variants** - Different versions being tested in an experiment
- **Metrics** - Measurements used to evaluate experiment outcomes
- **Targeting** - Rules for determining which users see which variants

## Product Ecosystem Integration

### Data Collection Flow
1. **Instrumentation** (via SDKs or APIs) captures user interactions
2. **Data Validation** checks incoming data against tracking plans
3. **Data Transformation** enriches and cleans the data
4. **Analytics Processing** prepares data for visualization and analysis
5. **Experiment Evaluation** uses the data to measure variant performance

### Cross-Product Features
- **Identity Resolution** works across all products to maintain consistent user identification
- **Data Access Controls** apply security policies throughout the platform
- **Integrations** connect Amplitude with external tools and platforms
- **Cross-Project Analysis** enables insights across multiple data sources

## API Endpoints and Implementation

The documentation reveals several key API endpoints:

- **HTTP V2 API**: `https://api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi` - For server-side event tracking
- **Batch Event Upload API**: `https://api2.amplitude.com/batch` - For data backfilling
- **Taxonomy API** - For programmatic management of tracking plans

SDK implementations follow consistent patterns across platforms:
1. **Initialization** with API key and configuration options
2. **Event Tracking** with event type and properties
3. **User Identification** to associate events with specific users
4. **User Property Management** to update user attributes
5. **Session Management** to track continuous user activity

The Ampli CLI provides developer tooling with commands like:
- `ampli pull` - Pull tracking plan changes
- `ampli status` - Check implementation status

## Collection Structure

The documentation is organized into several key sections:

1. **Product-specific collections** (Analytics, Data, Experiment, etc.)
2. **SDK documentation** for various platforms (iOS, Android, Browser, etc.)
3. **Chart-specific documentation** (Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, etc.)
4. **Integration documentation** for sources and destinations
5. **Administrative documentation** for account management and billing

This structure reflects Amplitude's comprehensive approach to product analytics, providing tools for data collection, governance, analysis, and optimization in a unified platform.
