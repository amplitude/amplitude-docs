# Amplitude Product Suite

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that helps organizations understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive business growth through data-driven insights. The platform collects, analyzes, visualizes, and enables action on user behavioral data across digital products.

Key features include event tracking, user journey analysis, cohort segmentation, experimentation capabilities, personalization tools, and data management solutions. Amplitude serves product teams, marketers, data analysts, and executives who need to understand user interactions with digital products and make data-driven decisions.

## Product Relationships and Features

Amplitude's ecosystem consists of five core products that work together:

1. **Amplitude Analytics**: The central analytics engine providing:
   - Event Segmentation for analyzing specific user behaviors
   - Funnel Analysis for tracking conversion paths
   - Retention Analysis for measuring user return rates
   - Journeys for visualizing user paths
   - User Sessions for analyzing engagement duration
   - Compass for identifying behaviors that predict retention
   - Engagement Matrix for assessing feature adoption

2. **Amplitude Data**: The foundation for data management:
   - Data collection from multiple sources (SDKs, APIs, integrations)
   - Tracking plan management and schema validation
   - User identity resolution across platforms
   - Data transformation and enrichment
   - Warehouse-native capabilities for direct data warehouse querying

3. **Amplitude Experiment**: Tools for testing and optimization:
   - A/B testing with statistical rigor
   - Feature flags for controlled rollouts
   - Multi-armed bandit experiments
   - Web experimentation for non-technical users
   - Integration with analytics for results analysis

4. **Amplitude CDP**: Customer data platform capabilities:
   - Audience segmentation through behavioral and predictive cohorts
   - Data activation through third-party integrations
   - Personalization with recommendations and predictions
   - Real-time profile API for dynamic experiences

5. **Amplitude Engage**: Targeted user engagement solutions:
   - In-product Guides and Surveys for user feedback
   - Session Replay for visual context of user experiences
   - Personalized messaging capabilities

These products form a closed loop system where data collection feeds analytics, analytics inform experiments, experiments drive engagement strategies, and engagement generates new data to analyze.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Events**: Discrete user actions tracked within a product (e.g., clicks, page views, purchases)
- **Event Properties**: Additional contextual information attached to events
- **User Properties**: Attributes that describe users (e.g., demographics, subscription status)
- **Cohorts**: Groups of users who share common characteristics or behaviors
- **Sessions**: Periods of continuous user activity within a product
- **Amplitude ID**: Internal identifier that links user activities across devices
- **Device ID**: Unique identifier for a specific device when user is anonymous
- **User ID**: Custom identifier assigned by the customer's application
- **Bucketing**: The process of assigning users to experiment variants
- **Feature Flags**: Controls that enable or disable features for specific users
- **Behavioral Cohorts**: User segments based on actions and behaviors
- **Predictive Cohorts**: User segments based on likelihood to perform future actions
- **MTU (Monthly Tracked Users)**: Unique users tracked in a calendar month (used for billing)

   - Warehouse-native connections to Snowflake, BigQuery, and other data warehouses

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Analytics tools for understanding user behavior
   - Experimentation capabilities for testing hypotheses
   - Session Replay for qualitative insights
   - AI-powered analysis with "Ask Amplitude"

3. **Data Activation**:
   - Cohort synchronization to marketing platforms
   - Feature flag deployment across applications
   - In-product messaging and surveys
   - Personalization through recommendations

4. **Development Integration**:
   - Ampli for type-safe analytics implementation
   - SDK plugins for extending functionality
   - API access for programmatic control
   - CI/CD integration for tracking plan validation

## Technical Implementation

Amplitude offers multiple implementation methods:

1. **Client-side SDKs**:
   ```javascript
   // Browser SDK example
   import * as amplitude from '@amplitude/analytics-browser';
   amplitude.init('API_KEY');
   amplitude.track('Button Clicked', {buttonColor: 'blue'});
   ```

2. **Server-side SDKs**:
   ```python
   # Python SDK example
   from amplitude import Amplitude
   amplitude = Amplitude('API_KEY')
   amplitude.track('user_id', 'Button Clicked', {'buttonColor': 'blue'})
   ```

3. **HTTP API**:
   ```
   POST https://api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi
   ```

4. **Ampli (Type-safe wrapper)**:
   ```typescript
   // Generated from tracking plan
   ampli.track('Button Clicked', {
     buttonColor: 'blue',
     buttonText: 'Sign Up'
   });
   ```

The platform provides extensive configuration options for data collection, user identification, session management, and privacy controls, with support for both US and EU data residency options for compliance with regional data regulations.
