2. **Experiment** - Platform for A/B testing and feature experimentation
   - Experiment design with targeting capabilities
   - Results analysis and impact measurement
   - Integration with Analytics for deeper insights

3. **CDP (Customer Data Platform)** - For data management and audience building
   - Audience creation and segmentation
   - Data source and destination management
   - Identity resolution across touchpoints

4. **SDKs and Instrumentation** - Implementation tools for various platforms
   - Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, and Flutter SDKs
   - Ampli for type-safe analytics implementation
   - Server-side SDKs (Node.js, Python, Java, Go)

5. **Data Management**
   - Sources for data ingestion
   - Destinations for data export
   - Audience segmentation
   - PII management controls

6. **Admin and Account Management**
   - Billing and usage monitoring
   - Single Sign-On implementation
   - User access management

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event** - A tracked user action or system occurrence
- **User/Device ID** - Unique identifiers for individual users across sessions
- **Session** - A period of continuous user activity
- **Funnel** - A sequence of events representing a user journey
- **Retention** - Measurement of users returning to the product over time
- **Cohort** - A group of users sharing common characteristics
- **Experiment** - A controlled test comparing variations of features
- **Audience** - A segment of users defined by specific criteria
- **Source** - A data provider sending information to Amplitude
- **Destination** - A system receiving data from Amplitude
- **SDK** - Libraries for implementing Amplitude in applications
- **Ampli** - Code generation tool for type-safe analytics implementation

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's platform architecture consists of four integrated layers:

1. **Data Collection Layer**
   - SDKs capture events from various platforms
   - Sources bring in data from external systems
   - APIs enable custom integrations

2. **Data Processing Layer**
   - Event processing and enrichment
   - Identity resolution
   - Data transformation

3. **Analysis and Action Layer**
   - Analytics for insights
   - Experiment for testing
   - CDP for audience activation
   - Destinations for data export

4. **Administration Layer**
   - Account management
   - Billing and usage monitoring
   - Access control and SSO

## API Endpoints and Implementation

### SDK Implementation Examples

**Browser SDK:**
```javascript
import * as amplitude from '@amplitude/analytics-browser';
amplitude.init('API_KEY');
amplitude.track('Button Clicked');
```

**iOS SDK:**
```swift
import AmplitudeSwift
let amplitude = Amplitude(configuration: Configuration(apiKey: "API_KEY"))
amplitude.track(event: BaseEvent(eventType: "Button Clicked"))
```

**Android SDK:**
```kotlin
import com.amplitude.android.Amplitude
val amplitude = Amplitude(Configuration(apiKey = "API_KEY", context = applicationContext))
amplitude.track("Button Clicked")
```

**Ampli SDK (Generated Code):**
```javascript
import { ampli } from './ampli';
ampli.init();
ampli.buttonClicked({
  buttonName: "Submit",
  buttonColor: "blue"
});
```
