# Amplitude Product Ecosystem Overview

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive analytics and customer data platform that helps businesses understand user behavior, optimize experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The product suite encompasses analytics, experimentation, data management, and personalization capabilities designed to create a complete data-insight-action loop.

## Product Relationships and Features

### Analytics Platform
The core analytics offering includes multiple visualization tools and analysis methods:
- **Event Segmentation**: Analyzes specific user actions and behaviors over time
- **Funnel Analysis**: Tracks conversion paths and identifies drop-off points in user journeys
- **Retention Analysis**: Measures how users continue to engage with a product over time
- **Revenue LTV**: Analyzes lifetime value and revenue metrics for different user segments
- **User Sessions**: Provides insights into user journeys and session behavior patterns
- **Journeys**: Visualizes the paths users take through a product
- **Impact Analysis**: Measures the impact of feature releases on key metrics
- **Personas**: Creates user segments based on behavioral patterns
- **Stickiness**: Measures the frequency of user engagement with specific features
- **Compass**: Discovers which behaviors correlate with retention and conversion
- **Legacy Charts**: Previous generation visualization tools maintained for backward compatibility

### Experimentation Platform
Integrated with the analytics platform, the experimentation suite includes:
- **Web Experiment**: Tools specifically designed for website experimentation
- **Experiment Theory**: Educational content on experimentation methodology and best practices
- **Advanced Techniques**: Sophisticated approaches for complex experimentation scenarios
- **Experiment Results**: Tools for analyzing and interpreting experiment outcomes
- **Workflow**: Processes and frameworks for managing the experimentation lifecycle
- **Under the Hood**: Technical details explaining how the experimentation platform functions
- **Experiment Troubleshooting**: Solutions for common issues encountered during experiments

### Data Management
Tools for collecting, organizing, and activating user data:
- **Sources**: Integration points for collecting data from various platforms
- **Source Catalog**: Directory of available data sources and integration options
- **Destination Catalog**: Directory of platforms where Amplitude data can be activated
- **Audiences**: Capabilities for creating and managing user segments
- **CDP**: Customer Data Platform functionality for unified user profiles
- **PII Integrations**: Specialized tools for handling personally identifiable information

### SDKs and APIs
Development tools for implementing Amplitude across platforms:
- **Analytics SDKs**: Platform-specific libraries (Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal)
- **Experiment SDKs**: Libraries for implementing and managing experiments
- **Ampli**: Amplitude's type-safe wrapper for analytics SDKs that provides code completion and validation
- **Instrumentation**: Guidelines and best practices for implementing tracking
- **API Documentation**: Comprehensive reference for Amplitude's programmatic interfaces

### Administration and Account Management
Tools for managing Amplitude implementation:
- **Account Management**: User permissions, organization settings, and workspace configuration
- **Billing and Use**: Subscription management and usage monitoring
- **Single Sign-On**: Authentication configuration for enterprise deployments

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: A discrete user action or system occurrence tracked in Amplitude (e.g., "Button Click", "Purchase Completed")
- **User Property**: Attributes associated with users that persist across sessions (demographics, preferences, account settings)
- **Cohort**: A defined group of users who share common characteristics or behaviors
- **Session**: A period of continuous user activity, typically ending after a period of inactivity
- **Funnel**: A sequence of events representing a conversion path or user journey
- **Retention**: Measurement of how users continue to engage with a product over time
- **Experiment**: A controlled test to measure the impact of changes to a product or experience
- **Variant**: A specific version in an experiment (control or treatment)
- **SDK (Software Development Kit)**: Libraries for implementing Amplitude tracking in applications
- **API (Application Programming Interface)**: Programmatic interfaces for interacting with Amplitude services
- **Instrumentation**: The process of implementing event tracking in an application
- **Taxonomy**: The structured organization of events and properties in Amplitude
- **Behavioral Cohort**: A group of users defined by their actions rather than attributes
- **Amplitude Audiences**: Dynamically updated user segments that can be activated across tools

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's products form an integrated ecosystem that supports a complete data lifecycle:

1. **Data Collection**: Events and user properties are captured via SDKs, APIs, or data integrations from various sources
2. **Data Management**: Raw data is processed, validated, and organized according to the defined taxonomy
3. **Analysis**: Data is visualized and analyzed through various chart types to generate insights
4. **Segmentation**: Users are grouped into meaningful cohorts based on behavior and attributes
5. **Experimentation**: Hypotheses derived from analysis are tested through controlled experiments
6. **Activation**: Insights and segments are deployed through integrations with marketing and product tools
7. **Measurement**: The impact of actions is measured, creating a continuous improvement cycle

The platform supports cross-product workflows where insights from analytics inform experiment design, experiment results refine user segmentation, and segments drive personalized experiences.

## API Endpoints and Implementation

### SDK Implementation Examples

**Browser SDK:**
```javascript
amplitude.getInstance().logEvent("Button Clicked", {
  buttonColor: "blue",
  buttonText: "Sign Up"
});
```

**iOS SDK:**
```swift
Amplitude.instance().logEvent("Button Clicked", withEventProperties: [
  "buttonColor": "blue",
  "buttonText": "Sign Up"
])
```

**Android SDK:**
```java
Amplitude.getInstance().logEvent("Button Clicked", new JSONObject().put("buttonColor", "blue").put("buttonText", "Sign Up"));
```

**Experiment SDK (JavaScript):**
```javascript
const variant = amplitude.experiment.variant("experiment-key");
if (variant === "control") {
  // Show control experience
} else if (variant === "treatment") {
  // Show treatment experience
}
```

The Amplitude platform is designed to serve multiple stakeholders within an organization, including product managers, analysts, developers, marketers, and executives, providing them with the tools to understand user behavior and make data-driven decisions.
