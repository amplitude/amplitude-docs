# Amplitude Product Documentation

## Product Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that helps businesses understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth. The platform enables companies to track user interactions, analyze product performance, conduct experiments, collect user feedback, and visualize user sessions in detail.

The platform's core value proposition centers on providing data-driven insights that help product teams make better decisions. Key capabilities include behavioral analytics, experimentation, in-product messaging, session recording, and robust data management.

Primary use cases include:
- Product optimization based on user behavior data
- User engagement and retention analysis
- Conversion rate improvement
- Feature experimentation and A/B testing
- Data-driven product decision making

## Product Relationships and Features

The Amplitude ecosystem consists of several integrated products:

1. **Analytics Core**
   - Various chart types (Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis)
   - User Sessions and Journeys visualization
   - Compass for behavior pattern analysis
   - Data Tables for tabular data visualization

2. **Data Collection and Management**
   - Cross-platform SDKs (Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity)
   - Ampli for type-safe analytics implementation
   - Sources for external data ingestion
   - Destinations for data export
   - Audience segmentation tools
   - Customer Data Platform (CDP) capabilities
   - PII management and governance

3. **Experimentation Platform**
   - Web Experiment for A/B testing
   - Experiment SDKs and APIs
   - Advanced experimentation methodologies
   - End-to-end experiment workflow management

4. **User Experience Tools**
   - Guides and Surveys for in-product messaging and feedback
   - Session Replay for visual recording of user interactions

5. **Administration**
   - Account and user management
   - Billing and usage monitoring
   - SSO configuration and security settings

These products are designed to work together seamlessly. For example, experiments created in the Experimentation platform can be analyzed using Analytics charts, while Guide and Survey interactions generate events that can be tracked in the Analytics platform.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Analytics Terms
- **Event**: A discrete user action or system occurrence that is tracked
- **Property**: Metadata associated with events providing additional context
- **User Property**: Attributes associated with specific users that persist across sessions
- **Cohort**: A defined group of users sharing common characteristics or behaviors
- **Funnel**: A sequence of events representing a conversion path or user journey
- **Retention**: Measurement of how often and when users return to the product
- **Session**: A period of continuous user activity, typically bounded by inactivity thresholds

### Experimentation Terms
- **Experiment**: A controlled test comparing different variations of a feature or experience
- **Variant**: A specific version or implementation being tested in an experiment
- **Flag**: A feature toggle that controls experiment exposure
- **Targeting**: Rules determining which users are included in which experiment variants
- **Evaluation**: The process of determining which variant to show a specific user

### Data Management Terms
- **Source**: An origin point for data ingestion into Amplitude
- **Destination**: An endpoint for exporting data from Amplitude
- **Integration**: A connection between Amplitude and another system or platform
- **Taxonomy**: The organizational structure of events and properties
- **Tracking Plan**: A specification for what events to track and how to structure them

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's platform functions as an integrated ecosystem with data flowing between products:

1. **Analytics + Experiment**: Experiment results feed directly into Analytics for comprehensive analysis
2. **Analytics + Guides and Surveys**: User interactions with guides and surveys generate analytics events
3. **Data Management + Analytics**: Data collected through SDKs and integrations powers analytics capabilities
4. **Session Replay + Analytics**: Session recordings link to user profiles and specific events
5. **Experiment + Guides and Surveys**: In-product messaging can be A/B tested using the Experiment platform

The platform connects with external systems through:
- Data warehouse integrations (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift)
- REST API access for programmatic data management
- Extensive SDK ecosystem supporting various platforms and languages
- Pre-built integrations with common marketing, product, and data tools

## API and SDK References

### Analytics API
- Base URL: `/apis/analytics/`
- Key endpoints for querying analytics data, managing cohorts, and accessing user profiles
- Supports both REST and GraphQL interfaces

### Experiment API
- Base URL: `/apis/experiment/`
- Endpoints for managing experiments, flags, and retrieving results
- Supports experiment creation, modification, and analysis

### Guides and Surveys API
- Base URL: `/apis/guides-and-surveys/`
- Endpoints for creating and managing in-product messages and surveys
- Supports targeting, scheduling, and content management

### SDK Implementation Examples
```javascript
// Browser SDK example
amplitude.init('API_KEY');
amplitude.track('Event Name', {property: 'value'});
```

```swift
// iOS SDK example
Amplitude.instance().initializeApiKey("API_KEY")
Amplitude.instance().logEvent("Event Name", withEventProperties: ["property": "value"])
```

The Ampli SDK provides code generation for type-safe analytics implementation, ensuring consistent event tracking across client applications regardless of platform, which helps maintain data quality and reliability.
