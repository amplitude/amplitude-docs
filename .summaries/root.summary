## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Event Tracking and Data Model
- **Events** - User actions or system occurrences tracked within applications
- **Properties** - Attributes associated with events providing contextual information
- **User Properties** - Persistent attributes associated with individual users
- **Group Properties** - Attributes associated with organizational or account-level entities
- **Amplitude ID** - Unique user identifier generated by Amplitude for cross-session tracking
- **Device ID** - Device-specific identifier for anonymous user tracking
- **Session ID** - Temporary identifier grouping events within a user session

### Analytics and Measurement
- **Segmentation** - Process of filtering and grouping users or events by specific criteria
- **Cohorts** - User groups defined by shared characteristics or behaviors
- **Funnels** - Sequential event analysis measuring conversion through defined steps
- **Retention** - Measurement of user return behavior over specified time periods
- **LTV (Lifetime Value)** - Revenue attribution and prediction modeling
- **DAU/WAU/MAU** - Daily, Weekly, Monthly Active User metrics

### Experimentation Framework
- **Feature Flags** - Configuration switches enabling dynamic feature control
- **Variants** - Different versions of features or experiences in experiments
- **Allocation** - Distribution of users across experiment variants
- **Statistical Significance** - Confidence measurement in experiment results
- **Lift** - Percentage improvement measurement between experiment variants

### Data Management
- **Tracking Plan** - Schema definition specifying event structure and validation rules
- **Taxonomy** - Organized classification system for events and properties
- **Data Validation** - Process ensuring data quality and schema compliance
- **Ingestion** - Process of collecting and processing incoming event data
- **Transformation** - Data processing and enrichment operations
