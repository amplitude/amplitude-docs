# Amplitude Product Documentation Overview

## Product Overview

Amplitude is a digital analytics platform that helps organizations understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform tracks, analyzes, and enables action on user interactions across digital products through an integrated suite of solutions.

## Product Relationships and Features

Amplitude's ecosystem consists of several interconnected products:

1. **Analytics** - The core product for analyzing user behavior through visualizations and charts
2. **Experiment** - A/B testing platform with statistical analysis capabilities
3. **CDP (Customer Data Platform)** - Manages data integration and processing
4. **Session Replay** - Provides visual recordings of user sessions for qualitative analysis
5. **Guides and Surveys** - Tools for collecting user feedback and delivering in-app messaging

These products are supported by a comprehensive data infrastructure including:

- **Multi-platform SDKs** for data collection across Browser/JavaScript, iOS, Android, server-side, game engines, and cross-platform frameworks
- **APIs** for Analytics, Experiment, and Guides/Surveys
- **Data management tools** including Sources, Source Catalog, Destination Catalog, Audiences, and PII Integrations
- **Warehouse Native Amplitude** for direct data warehouse integration

The Analytics product offers numerous visualization capabilities through chart types such as Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Revenue LTV, Stickiness, Personas, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Compass, Data Tables, and Legacy Charts.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### User Identification
- **Device ID**: Default identifier automatically assigned by SDKs
- **User ID**: Custom identifier for logged-in users
- **Amplitude ID**: Internal identifier used for cross-platform tracking

### Data Structure
- **Events**: User actions tracked with timestamps
- **Event Properties**: Contextual information about specific events
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes about users
- **Group Properties**: Attributes for organizational hierarchies

### Experiment-Specific Terms
- **Experiment Theory**: Conceptual framework for experimentation
- **Workflow**: Process management for experiments
- **Advanced Techniques**: Complex experimentation methodologies
- **Under the Hood**: Technical implementation details

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's platform follows a logical flow:

1. **Data Collection**: SDKs and APIs capture user interactions and send them to Amplitude
2. **Data Processing**: CDP and data management features organize and structure the data
3. **Analysis**: Analytics tools transform raw data into actionable insights
4. **Action**: Experiment, Session Replay, and Guides & Surveys enable teams to act on insights
5. **Integration**: Destination Catalog allows exporting insights to other business tools

The platform enables cross-product workflows where insights from Analytics inform Experiments, which can be validated through Session Replay and followed up with targeted messaging via Guides and Surveys.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

### Analytics API
- HTTP V2 API: `https://api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi` for real-time, low-volume data
- Batch Event Upload API for high-volume data transfers

### SDK Implementation
All Amplitude SDKs follow similar initialization patterns:
```javascript
// JavaScript example
amplitude.init('API_KEY', {
  // Configuration options
});

// Track events
amplitude.track('Event Name', {
  property1: 'value1',
  property2: 'value2'
});

// Identify users
amplitude.identify(new amplitude.Identify().set('user_property', 'value'));
```

The platform provides consistent methods across SDKs:
- `track()` - Record user actions
- `identify()` - Update user properties
- `setGroup()` - Associate users with organizational groups
