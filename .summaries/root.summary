Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, run controlled experiments, and optimize digital experiences through data-driven insights. The platform combines behavioral analytics, feature flagging, A/B testing, session replay, user engagement tools, and customer data management into an integrated ecosystem.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform consists of five primary interconnected products:

**Analytics** serves as the foundational layer, providing event tracking, user behavior analysis, and comprehensive visualization capabilities. It supports 13 distinct chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Revenue LTV, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Data Tables, and Compass for advanced analytics workflows.

**Experiment** functions as the feature flagging and experimentation engine, supporting both local and remote evaluation modes with sophisticated traffic allocation mechanisms, mutual exclusion groups, and statistical analysis capabilities including Bonferroni correction for multiple hypothesis testing scenarios.

**Session Replay** captures granular user interactions and session recordings to provide qualitative context for quantitative behavioral data, enabling deeper understanding of user experience issues and optimization opportunities.

**Guides and Surveys** enables in-product messaging, user onboarding flows, and feedback collection through targeted surveys and interactive guides that can be triggered based on user behavior patterns.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages the entire data lifecycle through source and destination catalogs, audience management, data transformation capabilities, and warehouse-native analysis features.

## Product Integration and Relationships

The products integrate through shared foundational systems including unified user identification, event tracking infrastructure, and cross-platform data synchronization. Analytics provides the behavioral data foundation that powers Experiment's advanced targeting and segmentation capabilities, while Session Replay offers qualitative context that enriches quantitative analytics insights.

Experiment results automatically feed back into Analytics for comprehensive impact analysis, and both products leverage shared cohort definitions and user segmentation logic. Guides and Surveys can be dynamically triggered based on Analytics insights and Experiment variant assignments, creating unified user experience optimization workflows. The CDP serves as the central data backbone, orchestrating data flow between internal products and external integrations while maintaining data consistency and governance.

## Key Nomenclature and Technical Definitions

**Sticky Bucketing**: Deterministic algorithm ensuring consistent experiment variant assignments across user sessions and devices to maintain statistical validity

**Mutual Exclusion Groups**: Traffic allocation mechanism preventing users from participating in conflicting experiments simultaneously, avoiding interaction effects

**Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM)**: Statistical diagnostic test detecting unexpected imbalances in traffic allocation that could indicate implementation issues or bias

**Cumulative Exposure Analysis**: Methodology for analyzing experiment health by examining user assignment patterns over time to detect systematic issues

**Winsorization**: Statistical technique for handling outliers by capping extreme values at specified percentiles to reduce impact on experiment results

**Flag Prerequisites**: Dependency management system allowing experiments to be conditional on other feature flag states, enabling complex rollout strategies

**Holdout Groups**: Control populations maintained across multiple experiments to measure cumulative program impact and avoid selection bias

**Ampli**: Type-safe analytics wrapper that generates strongly-typed code for event tracking with compile-time validation and IDE autocomplete support

**Mount Points**: Content management system identifiers that link collections to specific content trees within the platform's information architecture

## SDK and API Architecture

The platform provides comprehensive SDK coverage across development environments:

**Analytics SDKs** support Browser JavaScript, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine with consistent APIs for event tracking, user identification, and behavioral data collection.

**Experiment SDKs** offer specialized feature flagging capabilities with both server-side and client-side evaluation modes, supporting real-time flag updates and local caching for performance optimization.

**Ampli Code Generation** creates platform-specific, type-safe analytics implementations with compile-time validation, reducing implementation errors and improving developer experience.

**RESTful APIs** provide programmatic access through dedicated endpoints:
- `/apis/analytics/` for behavioral data queries and chart configuration
- `/apis/experiment/` for experiment management and flag evaluation  
- `/apis/guides-and-surveys/` for in-product messaging and survey management

## Broader Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude functions as a central hub in modern data stacks through extensive integration capabilities:

**Source Catalog** ingests data from hundreds of platforms including marketing tools, customer support systems, payment processors, and custom applications through pre-built connectors and webhook integrations.

**Destination Catalog** activates insights by sending processed data, audiences, and experiment results to downstream tools including marketing automation platforms, personalization engines, and business intelligence systems.

**Partners Program** extends platform functionality through certified third-party integrations, specialized industry solutions, and consulting services that address specific use cases and vertical requirements.

**Warehouse-Native Capabilities** enable analysis of data stored in customer data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift) without requiring data movement, supporting privacy-first architectures and reducing data duplication.

The platform supports enterprise requirements through comprehensive administrative features including multi-organization account management, granular billing and usage monitoring, single sign-on integration with major identity providers, and PII handling compliance features for GDPR and CCPA requirements.

## Documentation and Content Architecture

The documentation system reflects the platform's complexity with specialized sections organized around user workflows: getting started guides, instrumentation best practices, detailed product documentation, comprehensive API references, troubleshooting resources, and migration assistance for platform transitions.

The content architecture supports internationalization with dedicated Japanese translations and includes an academy system for educational resources, certification programs, and best practice guidance. The URL structure (`/analytics/`, `/feature-experiment/`, `/data/`, `/sdks/`, `/apis/`) mirrors the product architecture, providing intuitive navigation while maintaining clear separation between different product areas and technical implementation details.
