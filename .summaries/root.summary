Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with integrated tools for product analytics, feature experimentation, user engagement, and customer data management. The platform operates as an interconnected ecosystem of specialized products designed to deliver end-to-end customer analytics and experimentation capabilities.

## Product Architecture and Core Components

The Amplitude ecosystem consists of five primary product areas that work synergistically to provide complete customer analytics solutions:

**Analytics** forms the foundational layer, offering event tracking, user behavior analysis, and data visualization through specialized chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, Cohort Analysis (Lifecycle), User Sessions, Journeys, Compass, Data Tables, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, Stickiness, Personas, Revenue LTV, and Experiment Results charts. This product serves as the central hub for understanding user behavior and product performance.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers advanced feature flagging, A/B testing, and experimentation capabilities with sophisticated statistical theory, workflow management, and troubleshooting tools. The product operates under dedicated `/feature-experiment/` routing and includes specialized sections for advanced experimentation techniques, statistical analysis, and comprehensive workflow management.

**Session Replay** provides user session recording and analysis capabilities as a standalone product with independent navigation structure, enabling teams to observe actual user interactions and identify usability issues through recorded session playback.

**Guides and Surveys** enables in-app messaging, user onboarding flows, and feedback collection mechanisms, operating as "Amplitude Guides and Surveys" with dedicated API endpoints and SDK integration for programmatic campaign management.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages comprehensive data ingestion, transformation, and distribution through source catalogs, destination catalogs, audience management, and warehouse-native capabilities, serving as the data backbone for all other platform components.

## SDK and Integration Framework

Amplitude provides extensive SDK coverage across multiple platforms and programming languages, organized into distinct categories:

**Client-Side SDKs** include Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Unity, and Unreal Engine implementations, all organized under `/sdks/analytics/` routing with dedicated `analytics_sdks` navigation. These SDKs handle client-side event tracking, user identification, and real-time analytics data collection.

**Server-Side SDKs** encompass Node.js, Python, Java, and Go implementations for backend event tracking, server-side analytics, and data processing workflows.

**Ampli** serves as a type-safe wrapper system for analytics SDKs, providing code generation, validation capabilities, and schema enforcement across all supported platforms to ensure data quality and consistency.

**Experiment SDKs** offer specialized feature flagging and experimentation capabilities separate from analytics SDKs, with dedicated routing under `/sdks/experiment-sdks/` for managing feature flags, experiment assignments, and variant delivery.

All SDKs utilize mount points for modular content organization, enabling consistent cross-platform implementation patterns and standardized integration approaches.

## API Ecosystem and Authentication

The platform exposes comprehensive REST APIs across three main product areas with consistent authentication and organizational patterns:

**Analytics APIs** (`/apis/analytics/`) provide event ingestion endpoints, data export capabilities, and reporting functionality with dedicated mount points for organized documentation. These APIs enable programmatic access to analytics data, custom dashboard creation, and automated reporting workflows.

**Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) deliver feature flag management, experiment configuration, assignment logic, and results analysis functionality for programmatic experiment control and automation.

**Guides and Surveys APIs** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) enable programmatic control of user engagement campaigns, survey deployment, and feedback collection workflows.

All APIs utilize consistent authentication patterns organized under the `/apis/` namespace with dedicated navigation injection for seamless documentation browsing and implementation guidance.

## Data Management and Integration Capabilities

The CDP component provides robust data management through several specialized systems:

**Source Catalog** offers pre-built integrations for data ingestion from various platforms, organized with taxonomy-based categorization using `integration_category` classifications and dedicated navigation under `source-catalog`. This enables seamless data collection from existing tools and platforms.

**Destination Catalog** enables data distribution to external platforms and tools, similarly organized with integration categories and specialized routing under `/data/destination-catalog/` for automated data syndication and activation.

**Audiences** functionality allows for sophisticated user segmentation and cohort management with routing under `/data/audiences/`, enabling targeted analysis and personalized user experiences.

**Warehouse-Native Amplitude** provides direct data warehouse integration capabilities for organizations preferring to maintain data in their existing infrastructure while leveraging Amplitude's analytics capabilities.

**PII Integrations** handle personally identifiable information with specialized privacy and compliance considerations, ensuring data protection and regulatory compliance.

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

The platform includes comprehensive administrative capabilities for enterprise deployment:

**Account Management** provides user administration, permissions management, and organizational settings accessible via `/admin/account-management/` routing, enabling granular access control and team management.

**Single Sign-On (SSO)** enables enterprise authentication integration with dedicated documentation under `/admin/single-sign-on/` for seamless organizational identity management.

**Billing and Usage** management tools help organizations monitor consumption, track costs, and manage subscription details through `/admin/billing-use/` interfaces.

All administrative features utilize the `admin` navigation injection for consistent user experience and appropriate access control mechanisms.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

The platform employs specific terminology and concepts:

- **Events**: User actions tracked within applications
- **Properties**: Attributes associated with events or users
- **Cohorts**: Groups of users defined by shared characteristics or behaviors
- **Funnels**: Sequential user journey analysis
- **Retention**: User return behavior measurement
- **Feature Flags**: Dynamic configuration controls for application features
- **Experiments**: A/B tests and multivariate testing implementations
- **Variants**: Different versions of features or experiences in experiments
- **Audiences**: Segmented user groups for targeted analysis or engagement
- **Mount Points**: UUID-based content organization identifiers for stable cross-references

## Content Organization and Localization

The documentation platform supports multi-site architecture with English (`en`) and Japanese (`jp`) localization capabilities. Japanese content receives specialized treatment with dedicated navigation (`japanese_content`) and modified user experience settings including disabled feedback mechanisms (`hide_helpful: true`).

The content management system employs several organizational patterns:

**Collections** group related content with consistent routing, templating, and navigation injection patterns for logical content organization.

**Propagation Controls** manage content distribution across multiple sites with granular control over localization workflows and regional customization.

**Date Behavior** implements publication controls with past content marked public and future content remaining private until scheduled publication dates.

## Navigation and User Experience Architecture

The platform implements a sophisticated navigation system with context-aware injection across multiple specialized areas:

- `analytics` for core analytics features and chart types
- `experiment` for Amplitude Experiment functionality and feature flagging
- `data` for CDP and data management features
- `apis` for comprehensive API documentation
- `analytics_sdks` and `experiment_sdks` for respective SDK documentation and implementation guides
- `get_started` for onboarding workflows and migration guidance
- `admin` for administrative functions and enterprise features
- `session_replay` for Session Replay capabilities and analysis tools
- `guides_and_surveys` for user engagement and feedback collection tools

Each navigation context provides specialized user experiences with appropriate feature highlighting and cross-product integration points, enabling efficient navigation through the comprehensive platform documentation while maintaining workflow context within specific product areas.
