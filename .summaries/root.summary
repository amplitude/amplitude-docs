# Amplitude Analytics Platform

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides product teams with tools for user behavior analysis, feature experimentation, data management, and customer engagement. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products designed to support the complete product development lifecycle from instrumentation to insights.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem is structured around four core product pillars:

**Analytics Core**: The foundational analytics platform featuring multiple chart types (Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Cohorts, Personas, Journeys, Stickiness, Lifecycle, Impact Analysis, Revenue LTV, Engagement Matrix, Data Tables, and Compass) that enable comprehensive user behavior analysis and business intelligence.

**Amplitude Experiment**: A feature flagging and A/B testing platform that includes experiment design, statistical analysis, advanced targeting techniques, and comprehensive SDKs for implementation across multiple platforms.

**Amplitude Data (CDP)**: A customer data platform managing data ingestion, transformation, and activation through source catalogs, destination catalogs, audience management, and warehouse-native capabilities.

**Specialized Products**: Including Session Replay for user experience analysis, Guides and Surveys for in-product engagement, and Web Experiment for web-specific testing scenarios.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Analytics Concepts**:
- **Events**: User actions tracked within applications (e.g., button clicks, page views, purchases)
- **Properties**: Attributes associated with events or users that provide context and enable segmentation
- **Cohorts**: Groups of users defined by shared characteristics or behaviors
- **Funnels**: Sequential analysis of user progression through defined steps
- **Retention**: Measurement of user return behavior over time periods
- **Segmentation**: Breaking down event data by various dimensions and filters

**Experimentation Terminology**:
- **Feature Flags**: Boolean toggles that control feature visibility and behavior
- **Variants**: Different versions of features or experiences being tested
- **Allocation**: Distribution of users across different experiment variants
- **Statistical Significance**: Confidence level in experiment results
- **Lift**: Percentage improvement of a variant over the control group

**Data Management**:
- **Sources**: Systems that send data into Amplitude (mobile apps, websites, servers)
- **Destinations**: External platforms that receive data from Amplitude
- **Transformations**: Data processing rules applied during ingestion or export
- **Tracking Plans**: Schemas that define expected event structure and properties
- **Ampli**: Code generation tool that creates type-safe tracking implementations

**SDK and Implementation**:
- **Instrumentation**: Process of adding tracking code to applications
- **Client-side SDKs**: Libraries for web browsers and mobile applications
- **Server-side SDKs**: Libraries for backend and server environments
- **Autocapture**: Automatic collection of common events without manual instrumentation

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The platform operates through a unified data model where events flow from instrumentation through the analytics engine to power all downstream products:

**Data Flow Architecture**: Events collected via SDKs or APIs are processed through the CDP layer, enriched with user and session context, then made available across Analytics charts, Experiment analysis, and audience activation workflows.

**Cross-Product Integration**: Experiment results can be analyzed using Analytics charts, audiences created in Analytics can be used for Experiment targeting, and Session Replay sessions can be filtered by Analytics segments or Experiment variants.

**Multi-Site Support**: The platform supports multiple site configurations (English and Japanese) with content propagation controls and localized navigation structures.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Analytics APIs**:
- Event ingestion endpoints for real-time data collection
- Query APIs for programmatic access to chart data and user segments
- Export APIs for raw event data and processed analytics results

**Experiment APIs**:
- Feature flag evaluation endpoints for real-time variant assignment
- Configuration management APIs for experiment setup and modification
- Results APIs for accessing statistical analysis and performance metrics

**Data Management APIs**:
- Source and destination configuration endpoints
- Transformation rule management
- Audience export and activation APIs

**SDK Implementation Routes**:
The platform provides comprehensive SDK coverage with specific routing patterns:
- Analytics SDKs: `/sdks/analytics/{platform}/{slug}` (Android, iOS, Browser, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, Unreal)
- Experiment SDKs: `/sdks/experiment-sdks/{slug}`
- Ampli implementations: `/sdks/ampli/{slug}`

**Administrative Interfaces**:
- Account management: `/admin/account-management/{slug}`
- Billing and usage: `/admin/billing-use/{slug}`
- Single sign-on configuration: `/admin/single-sign-on/{slug}`

The platform architecture supports enterprise-scale deployments with features for data governance, privacy compliance (including PII handling), migration utilities for platform transitions, and extensive integration capabilities with third-party tools and data warehouses. The documentation structure reflects a comprehensive approach to user onboarding, from getting started guides through advanced implementation techniques and troubleshooting resources.
