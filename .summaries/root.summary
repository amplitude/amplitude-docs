Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables product teams to understand user behavior, optimize experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform operates on an event-based architecture that captures user interactions across web and mobile applications, processing this data into analytical insights through various chart types, experimentation tools, and data governance capabilities.

## Core Product Architecture and Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem consists of several interconnected products that work together to provide end-to-end analytics and experimentation capabilities:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational product, ingesting event data through multiple SDKs (Android, iOS, Browser, Flutter, React Native, Unity, Unreal, Node.js, Python, Java, Go) and APIs. This data feeds into various analytical chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Revenue LTV, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Data Tables, and Compass.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides A/B testing and feature flag capabilities, with dedicated sections for workflow management, advanced techniques, experiment theory, troubleshooting, and results analysis. The platform includes specialized Experiment SDKs and APIs that integrate with the core analytics infrastructure.

**Amplitude Data (CDP)** handles data governance through sources, destinations, audiences, and warehouse-native capabilities. It manages data ingestion from various sources and distribution to multiple destinations through a comprehensive catalog system.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures user session recordings for qualitative analysis, complementing the quantitative insights from the analytics platform.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product messaging and user feedback collection, with its own dedicated API for programmatic management.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Monthly Tracked Users (MTUs)** represent the primary billing metric, with different plan tiers offering varying MTU quotas and overage structures. The platform enforces **instrumentation limits** of 2000 event types, 2000 event properties, and 1000 user properties per project.

**Device IDs** follow platform-specific conventions: Android uses UUID, iOS uses IDFV/IDFA, while server-side implementations require manual configuration. **Session IDs** operate with platform-specific timeout rules (30 minutes for web, 5 minutes for mobile) and can be customized through SDK parameters.

**User Properties** store current user state information separately from events, while **Event Properties** are stored with each event and reflect historical values at the time of the event. The **(none)** bucket appears in charts when properties have null values due to instrumentation timing or missing data.

**Collections** in this documentation system represent organized groupings of related content, with each collection having specific routing patterns, navigation titles, and structural relationships. Collections can be mounted to specific UUIDs, indicating content inheritance or shared documentation structures.

## API Endpoints and Technical Integration

The platform provides several key API endpoints:

- **HTTP V2 API** (`/apis/analytics/`) for real-time event streaming with throttling limits
- **Batch Event Upload API** for bulk data processing and backfills  
- **Export API** for JSON format data extraction
- **Behavioral Cohorts API** with `props` and `propKeys` parameters
- **Attribution API** for mobile attribution with 72-hour mapping windows
- **Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) for programmatic experiment management
- **Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) for in-product messaging

SDK configuration involves key parameters like `flushIntervalMillis`, `flushQueueSize`, `eventUploadPeriodSeconds`, and `eventUploadThreshold` for controlling data transmission behavior.

## Statistical Analysis and Experimentation Framework

Amplitude Experiment employs **sequential testing** methodology with specific statistical thresholds (25 conversions + 100 exposures for uniques, 100 exposures for totals). This approach provides always-valid p-values and controlled Type 1 error rates compared to traditional T-tests.

**Mutual exclusion groups** prevent users from being assigned to multiple experiments simultaneously through slot allocation percentages. The platform calculates **statistical significance** using improvement over baseline ratios, supporting both unique conversions and totals with minimum sample size requirements.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The documentation structure reveals a comprehensive ecosystem that supports multiple user personas and use cases:

**Developers** access SDK catalogs, Ampli (type-safe analytics), and various programming language-specific SDKs with detailed implementation guides.

**Product Teams** utilize the analytics charts, experiment workflows, and data governance tools to make informed product decisions.

**Data Teams** leverage the CDP capabilities, warehouse-native features, source and destination catalogs, and API integrations for data pipeline management.

**Administrators** manage account settings, billing, single sign-on, and organizational governance through dedicated admin interfaces.

The platform maintains **immutable data architecture** where ingested data cannot be modified, though workarounds exist using Export API + Batch API workflows. Privacy compliance includes SOC2 Type 2, GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA standards, with features like the User Privacy API and Data Processing Addendum for enterprise customers.

The routing structure (`/analytics/`, `/feature-experiment/`, `/data/`, `/sdks/`, `/apis/`) reflects the platform's modular architecture, allowing users to navigate between different product areas while maintaining contextual relationships between analytics, experimentation, and data management capabilities.
