# Amplitude Analytics Platform Product Overview

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics platform that helps businesses understand user behavior, optimize experiences, and drive growth. The platform enables product teams to track user interactions, analyze behavioral patterns, create audience segments, run experiments, and make data-driven decisions through visualization tools and charts.

Key features include event tracking, user segmentation, funnel analysis, retention analysis, session replay, A/B testing, and data integration capabilities. Amplitude serves various use cases such as product optimization, user journey mapping, conversion rate improvement, feature experimentation, and data-driven decision making.

## Product Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem consists of five interconnected product areas:

1. **Analytics** - The core analytics platform with visualization and analysis tools:
   - Various chart types (Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions)
   - Compass for understanding user journeys and behavior patterns
   - Session Replay for watching actual user sessions

2. **Data** - Comprehensive data management capabilities:
   - Sources for importing data from external systems
   - Destination Catalog for exporting data to external systems
   - Audiences for user segmentation and cohort creation
   - CDP (Customer Data Platform) capabilities
   - PII Integrations for handling personally identifiable information

3. **Experiment** - A/B testing and feature experimentation platform:
   - Web Experiment tools for web-based experimentation
   - Experiment Theory educational content
   - Advanced Techniques for complex experimentation methodologies
   - Workflow for experiment process management
   - Technical details about the experimentation system

4. **SDKs & APIs** - Implementation tools for different platforms:
   - Analytics SDKs for various platforms (iOS, Android, Web)
   - Experiment SDKs for client-side experimentation
   - Ampli for type-safe wrapper implementations
   - APIs for programmatic access

5. **Admin** - Administrative tools:
   - Account Management for user and organization settings
   - Billing and Use information
   - Single Sign-On configuration

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event**: A discrete user action or system occurrence tracked in Amplitude
- **User Properties**: Attributes associated with specific users
- **Event Properties**: Attributes associated with specific events
- **Cohort/Audience**: A group of users who share common characteristics or behaviors
- **Funnel**: A series of steps users take toward a conversion goal
- **Retention**: Measurement of how users continue to engage over time
- **Session**: A period of continuous user engagement
- **Instrumentation**: The process of implementing tracking in applications
- **Source**: An origin point for data imported into Amplitude
- **Destination**: A target system where Amplitude data is exported
- **Experiment**: A controlled test comparing variations of features or experiences
- **SDK**: Client libraries for implementing Amplitude in applications
- **API**: Programmatic interfaces for interacting with Amplitude
- **Taxonomy**: The organizational structure of events and properties

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude functions as an integrated ecosystem with a clear data flow:

1. **Data Collection**: Events are collected through SDKs or server-side APIs
2. **Data Processing**: Raw events are processed, enriched, and stored
3. **Analysis**: Processed data is made available through visualization tools
4. **Audience Creation**: Users are segmented into cohorts based on behavior or properties
5. **Experimentation**: Audiences can be targeted with experiments to test hypotheses
6. **Data Export**: Insights and raw data can be exported to external systems

The platform integrates with data warehouses, marketing platforms, and customer engagement tools through its extensive Destination Catalog.
