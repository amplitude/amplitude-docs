Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive data-driven decision making. The platform consists of several interconnected products that work together to provide end-to-end analytics capabilities from data collection to insights generation.

## Core Product Architecture

The Amplitude ecosystem is built around several key products that integrate seamlessly:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the core behavioral analytics engine, providing advanced charting capabilities, user segmentation, and behavioral insights. It processes event-based data to generate actionable insights about user journeys, retention patterns, and product performance.

**Amplitude Experiment** is the feature flagging and A/B testing platform that enables teams to run controlled experiments, manage feature rollouts, and measure the impact of product changes on user behavior.

**Amplitude Data** functions as the data governance and instrumentation management layer, providing tracking plan creation, schema validation, and data quality controls.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and replays user sessions to provide qualitative insights into user behavior and identify friction points in the user experience.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product messaging, user onboarding flows, and feedback collection to improve user engagement and gather insights.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

The products are deeply integrated through shared data models and cross-product workflows:

**Data Flow Integration**: Events collected through Amplitude Data's tracking plans flow into Analytics for analysis, Experiment for impact measurement, and Session Replay for behavioral context. The Customer Data Platform (CDP) capabilities enable data synchronization across the ecosystem and with external tools.

**Shared Analytics Foundation**: All products leverage the same underlying event data model, enabling consistent user identification, segmentation, and measurement across features. Charts and analysis capabilities are shared between Analytics and Experiment for unified reporting.

**Cross-Product Workflows**: Experiment results can be analyzed using Analytics charts, Session Replay provides qualitative context for quantitative Analytics insights, and Guides and Surveys can be triggered based on Analytics segments and behavioral patterns.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Data Concepts**:
- **Events**: User actions or system occurrences that are tracked (e.g., "Button Clicked", "Purchase Completed")
- **Event Properties**: Attributes specific to individual events at the time they occur
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes associated with users across sessions
- **Group Properties**: Account or organization-level attributes (requires Accounts add-on)
- **Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments based on behavioral criteria or properties

**Analytics Terminology**:
- **Segmentation**: Breaking down analysis by user properties, event properties, or cohorts
- **Funnels**: Multi-step conversion analysis showing drop-off rates between events
- **Retention**: Analysis of user return behavior over time periods
- **LTV (Lifetime Value)**: Revenue analysis showing user value over time
- **Stickiness**: Frequency analysis showing how often users perform actions within time periods

**Experimentation Concepts**:
- **Feature Flags**: Boolean toggles that control feature availability
- **Variants**: Different versions of features or experiences in experiments
- **Allocation**: Percentage of users exposed to experiments or feature flags
- **Holdout Groups**: Control groups that don't receive experimental treatments
- **Statistical Significance**: Confidence level that observed differences are not due to chance

**Data Management Terms**:
- **Tracking Plans**: Schema definitions that specify which events and properties to collect
- **Ampli**: Code generation tool that creates type-safe SDKs from tracking plans
- **Transformations**: Retroactive data modifications applied at query time
- **Derived Properties**: Calculated properties created from existing event or user data
- **Schema Violations**: Data that doesn't match the defined tracking plan structure

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates extensively with the modern data and product development stack:

**Data Infrastructure**: The platform connects with data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift), customer data platforms (Segment, mParticle), and supports both real-time streaming and batch data import/export workflows.

**Development Tools**: Git-like branching workflows for tracking plan management, comprehensive SDK support across platforms, and integration with development tools like Jira for project management.

**Marketing and Product Tools**: Destination catalogs enable data sharing with marketing automation platforms, CRM systems, and other product tools. Cohort synchronization allows behavioral segments to be used in downstream marketing campaigns.

**Enterprise Infrastructure**: Single sign-on (SSO) integration, role-based access controls, data access controls for sensitive information, and compliance features for GDPR/CCPA requirements.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Analytics APIs**:
- **HTTP V2 API**: Real-time event ingestion at `/2/httpapi` with support for 1000 events/second
- **Batch Event Upload API**: Historical data import with 500K events per device daily limits
- **Taxonomy API**: CRUD operations for event types, properties, and categories
- **Cohort API**: Programmatic cohort management and synchronization
- **Dashboard REST API**: Automated chart and dashboard management

**Experiment APIs**:
- **Evaluation API**: Real-time feature flag and experiment variant resolution
- **Management API**: Experiment configuration, flag management, and results retrieval
- **Deployment API**: Integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated flag management

**Data Management APIs**:
- **User Privacy API**: Data deletion for compliance requirements
- **Export API**: Bulk data export for warehouse integration
- **Import API**: Historical data backfill and migration support

**SDK Integration Commands**:
- **Ampli CLI**: `ampli pull` for tracking plan synchronization, `ampli status` for validation
- **Analytics SDKs**: `amplitude.track()`, `amplitude.identify()`, `amplitude.setUserProperties()`
- **Experiment SDKs**: `experiment.variant()`, `experiment.exposure()` for flag evaluation
- **Configuration Options**: Session timeout controls, batch size optimization, retry mechanisms

**Key Technical Specifications**:
- **Rate Limits**: 100 batches/second for Batch API, 30 requests/second for most APIs
- **Data Retention**: Varies by plan tier, with enterprise options for extended retention
- **Real-time Processing**: Sub-minute latency for most event processing and chart updates
- **Multi-region Support**: Data residency options for compliance requirements
- **SDK Coverage**: Client-side (Browser, iOS, Android, React Native, Flutter, Unity) and server-side (Node.js, Python, Java, Go, PHP) implementations

The platform is designed to scale from startup implementations to enterprise deployments, with comprehensive monitoring, alerting, and data quality controls throughout the analytics pipeline.
