Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and product intelligence platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive data-informed decision making across web, mobile, and server environments. The platform consists of four core products - Analytics, Data, Experiment, and Session Replay - that share a unified data foundation and work together to provide end-to-end product analytics capabilities.

## Core Product Architecture and Relationships

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the primary behavioral analytics engine, offering 16+ specialized chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Personas, and Revenue LTV. The analytics platform is built around four foundational modules: Events (for event selection and configuration), Segmentation (for user targeting), Measured As (for quantifying behavior), and Group-by functionality (for data breakdown).

**Amplitude Data** functions as the centralized data management and governance layer, providing data warehouse integrations, event schema management, user property tracking, and data quality monitoring. The Data platform includes Sources for data ingestion, destination catalog with 100+ integrations, and audience management capabilities.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers feature flag management and A/B testing capabilities through a structured workflow encompassing experiment creation, audience targeting, statistical analysis, and deployment management. The platform supports both traditional hypothesis-driven A/B testing and automated multi-armed bandit optimization using Thompson sampling.

**Amplitude Session Replay** provides visual user experience analytics through session recording, heatmaps, and behavioral analytics across web, mobile, and React Native applications. The product captures DOM interactions and user behavior patterns through view tree capture and diff-based replay construction.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Identity Framework:**
- **Amplitude ID**: System-generated unique identifier that tracks users across sessions and devices
- **Device ID**: Platform-specific identifier (IDFV for iOS, UUID for web browsers, advertising identifiers)
- **User ID**: Application-defined custom identifier for authenticated users
- **Session ID**: Automatically generated identifier grouping related user events

**Event and Property Types:**
- **Event Properties**: Contextual attributes describing specific user actions
- **User Properties**: Persistent characteristics associated with individual users
- **Group Properties**: Analytics data associated with user groups or organizations

**Experimentation Concepts:**
- **Bucketing Units**: Fundamental unit for experiment assignment (User or Group/Company ID)
- **Evaluation Modes**: Remote evaluation (real-time) vs. Local evaluation (client-side performance)
- **Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE)**: Smallest effect size an experiment can reliably detect
- **CUPED**: Controlled-experiment using pre-existing data for variance reduction

**Session Replay Terminology:**
- **Session Replay ID**: Unique identifier linking analytics events to replay data
- **Sample Rate**: Configuration parameter controlling percentage of sessions recorded
- **Masking Levels**: Privacy protection tiers (Conservative, Light, Medium)

**Data Management:**
- **Behavioral Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments defined by product usage patterns
- **Destination Catalog**: Data activation platform with 100+ integrations
- **Source Catalog**: Data ingestion platform for third-party data sources

## Product Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude platform integrates into broader product development and analytics ecosystems through multiple touchpoints:

**Data Infrastructure**: Native connectors to Snowflake, BigQuery, and Redshift data warehouses enable bi-directional data flow. The platform supports customer data platform (CDP) integrations and provides export capabilities for business intelligence tools.

**SDK Ecosystem**: Comprehensive SDKs across platforms including Browser SDK 2.x, Android SDK, iOS SDK, React Native SDK, Node.js SDK, Python SDK, Java SDK, Go SDK, Flutter SDK, Unity SDK, and Unreal SDK. The Ampli wrapper generates strongly-typed APIs from Amplitude Data tracking plans.

**Third-Party Integrations**: Extensive destination catalog includes marketing automation platforms (HubSpot, Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Braze), advertising networks (Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads), experimentation platforms (Optimizely, LaunchDarkly), and customer engagement tools (Intercom, Customer.io).

**Enterprise Features**: EU data residency support, single sign-on (SSO) integration, role-based access controls, and compliance features including GDPR, CCPA, and COPPA support.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Analytics APIs:**
- HTTP V2 API for event ingestion with batch processing support
- Dashboard REST API for programmatic chart data access
- Export API for bulk data extraction using server_upload_time parameters

**Experiment APIs:**
- Evaluation REST API for flag evaluation and variant assignment
- Management API for experiment configuration and results analysis
- SDK integration supporting both online and offline modes

**Session Replay APIs:**
- `sessionReplay.init()`: Initialize standalone SDK
- `sessionReplay.setSessionId()`: Manual session ID management
- `sessionReplay.getSessionReplayProperties()`: Retrieve session metadata

**Data Management APIs:**
- Cohort sync APIs for behavioral audience export (`/api/cohorts/sync`)
- Event streaming APIs for real-time event forwarding (`/events/track`)
- User profile APIs for property synchronization (`/users/identify`)

**SDK Configuration Parameters:**
- `instanceName`: Unique identifier for multi-tenant environments
- `flushIntervalMillis`: Data transmission frequency
- `serverZone`: Geographic data routing (EU/US)
- `transportProvider`: Network layer configuration
- `trackingOptions`: Granular control over data collection

**Command Line Tools:**
- `ampli pull`: Download tracking plan schemas and generate typed APIs
- `ampli status`: Verify tracking plan synchronization
- Migration utilities for SDK upgrades and platform transitions

The platform implements enterprise-grade reliability patterns including request size limits, retry mechanisms with exponential backoff, rate limiting handling, delivery status monitoring, and comprehensive error notification systems across all integration points.
