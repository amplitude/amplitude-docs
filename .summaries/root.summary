Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, run controlled experiments, and make data-driven product decisions. The platform combines behavioral analytics, A/B testing, session replay, user engagement tools, and customer data management into an integrated ecosystem.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform operates on a hierarchical organizational structure with organizations containing multiple projects and data sources. The system supports multi-site deployment with English and Japanese localization, providing both client-side and server-side data collection capabilities through extensive SDK libraries and REST APIs.

**Analytics Engine**: The core analytics product provides behavioral analysis through specialized chart types including Event Segmentation for user action analysis, Funnel Analysis for conversion tracking, Retention Analysis for user return behavior, User Sessions for interaction patterns, Journeys for user path analysis, Lifecycle for user state transitions, Stickiness for engagement measurement, Personas for user segmentation, Compass for metric monitoring, Data Tables for raw data exploration, Engagement Matrix for feature adoption analysis, Impact Analysis for causal inference, Revenue LTV for monetization analysis, and Experiment Results for A/B test evaluation.

**Experimentation Platform**: Amplitude Experiment enables feature flagging and A/B testing through a workflow-driven approach supporting both statistical experimentation and progressive feature rollouts. The system includes advanced statistical techniques, experiment design theory, comprehensive troubleshooting resources, and multi-platform SDK support for implementation.

**Session Replay**: Provides visual user session recordings integrated with analytics data for behavioral context and debugging capabilities.

**Engagement Tools**: Guides and Surveys enable in-product messaging, user onboarding flows, and feedback collection with targeting based on behavioral data.

**Customer Data Platform**: The CDP handles data ingestion, transformation, and activation through source and destination catalogs, audience management, and warehouse-native functionality supporting extensive third-party integrations.

## Product Integration and Relationships

Products integrate through shared user identity resolution systems, cross-product data sharing, and unified authentication. Analytics data feeds into Experiment for cohort targeting and user enrichment, while Session Replay provides behavioral context for analytics insights. The CDP serves as the central data infrastructure, enabling data flow between internal products and external systems.

**Identity Resolution**: The platform maintains consistent user identification across products using `amplitude_id` (internal identifier), `user_id` (customer-defined), `device_id` (device-specific), and `session_id` (session tracking) to create unified user profiles.

**Cross-Product Data Flow**: Behavioral data from Analytics informs experiment targeting in Amplitude Experiment, while experiment exposure and conversion data feeds back into Analytics for comprehensive analysis. Session Replay data enhances Analytics insights with visual context, and CDP audiences enable targeted messaging through Guides and Surveys.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Identifiers**:
- `amplitude_id`: Platform-generated unique user identifier
- `user_id`: Customer-defined user identifier for business logic
- `device_id`: Device-specific identifier for cross-session tracking
- `session_id`: Individual session tracking identifier

**Analytics Terminology**:
- Event Segmentation: Analysis of user actions and behavioral trends
- Funnel Analysis: Multi-step conversion process tracking
- Retention Analysis: Measurement of user return behavior over time
- Cohort Analysis: Comparative analysis of user groups
- Personas: Automated user segment identification based on behavior patterns

**Experimentation Concepts**:
- Variants: Experiment treatments with configurable payloads
- Bucketing: Algorithm for assigning users to experiment groups
- Allocation: Percentage of traffic exposed to experiments
- Guardrail Metrics: Safety metrics monitoring for negative impact detection
- CUPED (Controlled-experiment Using Pre-Experiment Data): Variance reduction technique for improved statistical sensitivity

**Data Management Terms**:
- Sources: Data ingestion endpoints from various platforms and systems
- Destinations: Data activation endpoints for external system integration
- Audiences: Behavioral segments for targeting and activation
- Taxonomies: Event schema management and governance frameworks

## Broader Ecosystem Integration

The platform integrates extensively with the marketing technology and analytics ecosystem through partner integrations, comprehensive source and destination catalogs, and API connectivity. The system supports warehouse-native deployments, enabling organizations to maintain data sovereignty while leveraging Amplitude's analytics capabilities.

**SDK Ecosystem**: Multi-platform SDK support includes Browser JavaScript, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine implementations. Each SDK provides platform-specific optimization while maintaining consistent API patterns and feature parity across languages.

**API Architecture**: REST APIs for Analytics (`/analytics/v2/`), Experiment (`/experiment/v1/`), and Guides and Surveys (`/guides/v1/`) enable programmatic access to data ingestion, user management, experiment configuration, and survey deployment. APIs support both real-time and batch operations with comprehensive authentication, rate limiting, and error handling.

**Enterprise Features**: Advanced organizational capabilities include single sign-on (SSO) integration, SCIM user provisioning, granular permissions management, multi-project architectures with Portfolio add-ons for cross-project data sharing, and comprehensive audit logging for compliance requirements.

**Privacy and Compliance**: Built-in privacy controls include user data deletion APIs (`/deletions`), CCPA Data Subject Access Request (DSAR) functionality, PII handling integrations, and GDPR compliance tools with automated data governance workflows.

**Administrative Infrastructure**: Account management includes billing and usage monitoring, user provisioning workflows, organizational governance tools, and support for complex enterprise hierarchies with delegated administration capabilities.

The platform serves organizations from startups to enterprises, providing scalable analytics and experimentation infrastructure with flexible deployment options including cloud-hosted SaaS and warehouse-native implementations for data residency requirements.
