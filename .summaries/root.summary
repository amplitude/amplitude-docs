## Product Relationships and Architecture

Amplitude's platform follows a logical workflow:

1. **Data Collection**: User behavior data is captured via SDKs and integrations
2. **Data Processing**: The platform processes and organizes this data
3. **Analysis**: Analytics tools generate insights into user behavior
4. **Action**: Experimentation and integration features enable acting on insights

The products are designed for seamless integration:
- **Analytics** provides insights that inform **Experiment** hypotheses
- **Data** management ensures quality input for both analytics and experimentation
- **SDKs** enable implementation across platforms
- **APIs** support custom integrations and workflows

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Events**: User actions tracked in the system (e.g., "Button Clicked", "Purchase Completed")
- **Properties**: Metadata associated with events or users (e.g., button color, purchase amount)
- **Cohorts**: Defined groups of users based on behavior or attributes
- **Journeys**: Visualization of user paths through a product
- **Funnels**: Sequential series of events that track conversion
- **Retention**: Measurement of how users return to a product over time
- **Segmentation**: Breaking down metrics by user attributes
- **Experiments**: Controlled tests of product variations
- **Instrumentation**: The process of implementing tracking code

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude functions as an end-to-end analytics and experimentation platform with distinct layers:

- **Data Collection Layer**: SDKs and integrations capture user behavior
- **Data Management Layer**: Processing, organization, and storage of user data
- **Analysis Layer**: Visualization and insight generation
- **Action Layer**: Experimentation and integration with other tools

The platform supports a complete analytics lifecycle from data collection to action, with each product addressing a specific part of this workflow.
