Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools for product analytics, feature experimentation, customer data management, and user engagement. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products designed to help teams understand user behavior, test product changes, and optimize user experiences across web and mobile applications.

## Core Product Architecture

The platform is built around several primary products that work together in an integrated ecosystem:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, providing event tracking, user behavior analysis, and comprehensive reporting through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, Cohort Analysis, and User Journey mapping. The analytics platform supports real-time data processing and offers advanced features like Compass (automated insights), Personas (behavioral cohorts), and custom dashboards.

**Amplitude Experiment** is the feature flagging and A/B testing platform that enables controlled feature rollouts and experimentation. It supports both remote and local evaluation modes, sophisticated user targeting including cohort-based segmentation, and comprehensive statistical analysis of experiment results.

**Amplitude CDP (Customer Data Platform)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and distribution across the ecosystem. It includes source catalogs for data collection, destination catalogs for data activation, audience management, and warehouse-native capabilities for organizations using modern data stacks.

**Amplitude Session Replay** provides detailed user session recordings and analysis capabilities, allowing teams to observe actual user interactions and identify usability issues.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user engagement through targeted messaging, onboarding flows, and feedback collection mechanisms.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events**: Discrete user actions tracked within applications, forming the foundation of all analytics and experimentation. Events contain properties that provide context about user behavior and application state.

**User Properties**: Attributes associated with individual users that persist across sessions, used for segmentation, targeting, and analysis. These work alongside Group Properties for account-level analysis.

**Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments based on behavioral criteria, automatically updated and usable across analytics, experimentation, and activation use cases.

**Deployment Key**: Authentication credential used by SDKs to identify specific project environments and enable data collection or experiment evaluation.

**Flag Key**: Unique identifier for feature flags within Amplitude Experiment, used to retrieve variant assignments and control feature visibility.

**Variants**: Different versions or treatments within experiments that users can be assigned to, enabling A/B testing and gradual feature rollouts.

**Sources and Destinations**: Data integration points where Sources collect data from various platforms and Destinations send processed data to external systems for activation.

**Instrumentation**: The process of implementing tracking code within applications using Amplitude's SDKs to collect user behavior data.

**Amplitude Query Language (AQL)**: Advanced querying interface for complex data analysis and custom reporting requirements.

## SDK and Integration Ecosystem

The platform provides extensive SDK coverage across multiple programming languages and platforms:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser/JavaScript, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, and PHP implementations. These SDKs handle event tracking, user identification, and automatic data collection with features like automatic session tracking, revenue tracking, and offline data buffering.

**Experiment SDKs** mirror the analytics SDK coverage while adding experiment-specific functionality including variant evaluation, exposure tracking, assignment logging, and cohort targeting. They support both client-side and server-side evaluation modes with sophisticated caching and performance optimization.

**Ampli** is a code-generation tool that creates type-safe tracking libraries based on predefined tracking plans, ensuring data quality and consistency across development teams.

**Framework Integrations** provide specialized implementations for popular development frameworks, reducing integration complexity and providing framework-specific optimizations.

## Data Management and Privacy

The platform includes comprehensive data governance features:

**PII (Personally Identifiable Information) Management** provides tools for handling sensitive data in compliance with privacy regulations, including data masking, deletion, and access controls.

**Warehouse-Native Amplitude** enables organizations to run Amplitude analytics directly on their existing data warehouse infrastructure, maintaining data residency and control.

**Data Tables** provide direct access to underlying event data for custom analysis and integration with external tools.

**Account Management** includes user provisioning, role-based access control, and organization-level settings management.

## API Infrastructure

The platform exposes comprehensive APIs for programmatic access:

**Analytics APIs** provide access to event data, user profiles, cohort definitions, and chart results for custom integrations and data export.

**Experiment APIs** enable programmatic experiment management, flag configuration, and results analysis for automated workflows.

**Guides and Surveys API** allows programmatic control of in-product messaging and survey campaigns.

All APIs support authentication via API keys and deployment keys, with rate limiting and comprehensive error handling.

## Chart Types and Analysis Capabilities

The analytics platform provides specialized chart types for different analysis needs:

**Event Segmentation** analyzes event frequency and properties across user segments and time periods.

**Funnel Analysis** tracks user progression through defined conversion paths with step-by-step drop-off analysis.

**Retention Analysis** measures user return behavior over time with cohort-based retention curves.

**User Sessions** provides session-based analysis including session duration, depth, and engagement metrics.

**Journeys** maps actual user paths through applications, identifying common navigation patterns.

**Revenue LTV** tracks customer lifetime value and revenue attribution across user segments.

**Engagement Matrix** correlates user engagement levels with retention and conversion outcomes.

**Impact Analysis** measures the statistical impact of product changes on key metrics.

**Stickiness** analyzes user engagement frequency and habit formation.

**Lifecycle** categorizes users into behavioral lifecycle stages (new, current, dormant, resurrected).

## Administrative and Enterprise Features

**Single Sign-On (SSO)** integration supports SAML and OAuth providers for enterprise authentication.

**Billing and Usage** management provides detailed usage tracking, plan management, and cost optimization tools.

**Migration** tools and documentation support transitions from other analytics platforms with data preservation and mapping capabilities.

**Partners** ecosystem includes certified integrations with marketing, product, and data tools for extended functionality.

The platform supports multi-site deployments with separate English and Japanese documentation sites, indicating global reach and localization capabilities. Advanced features include experiment theory documentation, troubleshooting guides, and comprehensive FAQ resources for technical implementation support.
