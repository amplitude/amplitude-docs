Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with integrated tools for understanding user behavior, optimizing product experiences, and driving growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of four core products working together to deliver end-to-end product intelligence capabilities.

## Core Product Suite and Architecture

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational behavioral analytics engine, enabling teams to track, measure, and analyze user interactions across digital products through event-based data collection. The platform provides sophisticated charting capabilities including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Cohort Analysis, Revenue LTV, Pathfinder, Compass, Stickiness, Lifecycle, Personas, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, Data Tables, and Experiment Results visualization.

**Amplitude Data** functions as the comprehensive data management and governance layer, handling data ingestion, transformation, quality assurance, and distribution across the organization. It includes the Source Catalog (70+ connectors), Destination Catalog for data routing, Audiences for behavioral segmentation, and warehouse-native capabilities for enterprise data infrastructure integration.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities through both remote and local evaluation modes, supporting controlled feature rollouts, statistical experimentation, and dynamic configuration management across client-side and server-side environments.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and reconstructs user sessions through DOM capture, view tree recording, and behavioral heatmaps, providing visual insights into user behavior patterns while maintaining strict privacy compliance through multi-level masking systems.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** provides in-product user engagement through contextual guides, feedback collection surveys, and resource centers, supporting user onboarding optimization and retention enhancement.

## SDK and Integration Ecosystem

The platform provides comprehensive instrumentation capabilities through multiple SDK categories:

**Analytics SDKs** support event tracking across platforms including Browser SDK 2.0 (`@amplitude/analytics-browser`), iOS Swift SDK, Android-Kotlin SDK, React Native SDK, Flutter SDK, Unity SDK, Unreal SDK, and server-side SDKs for Node.js, Python, Java, Go, and PHP. All SDKs utilize Amplitude's HTTP V2 API with automatic batching, retry logic, and offline queuing capabilities.

**Experiment SDKs** enable feature flagging and experimentation across the same platform coverage, supporting both remote evaluation (real-time API calls) and local evaluation (client-side processing) modes with cohort targeting, exposure tracking, and analytics integration.

**Session Replay SDKs** provide user session recording capabilities through plugin architecture (Browser, Android, iOS, React Native) with privacy-compliant masking, consent management, and heatmap generation.

**Ampli Code Generation** creates strongly-typed tracking APIs from centralized tracking plans, supporting TypeScript, JavaScript, Swift, Kotlin, Python, and other languages with compile-time validation and schema enforcement.

## Key Technical Nomenclature

**Event Architecture**: Events represent user actions tracked using verb+noun naming conventions, with Event Properties providing contextual metadata and User Properties maintaining persistent user characteristics across sessions.

**User Identification**: The platform uses Amplitude ID (platform-generated), Device ID (device-specific), and User ID (custom developer-assigned) for cross-session and cross-device user journey tracking.

**Session Management**: Configurable session timeouts (5 minutes mobile, 30 minutes web) with Session ID timestamps and Monthly Tracked Users (MTU) as the primary billing metric.

**Data Governance**: Tracking Plans define event schemas and validation rules, while Taxonomy API provides programmatic schema management with PII classification and Data Access Controls.

**Experimentation Concepts**: Flag Keys identify experiments, Variants define treatment versions, Bucketing algorithms assign users to experiments, and Deployment Keys authenticate SDK access to experiment configurations.

**Privacy and Compliance**: GDPR/CCPA compliance through User Privacy API, consent management integration, data residency controls (US/EU ServerZone), and comprehensive opt-out mechanisms.

## API Infrastructure and Endpoints

**Data Ingestion APIs**:
- HTTP V2 API (`/2/httpapi`): Primary event ingestion endpoint
- Batch Event Upload API (`/batch`): High-volume event processing
- Identify API (`/identify`): User property management without events
- Attribution API (`/attribution`): Mobile advertising attribution

**Analytics and Export APIs**:
- Dashboard REST API: Structured analytics data retrieval
- Export API (`/api/2/export`): Raw event data extraction
- User Profile API: Comprehensive user profile retrieval
- Behavioral Cohorts API: User segmentation management

**Experiment APIs**:
- Evaluation API (`/v1/vardata`, `/v1/flags`): Variant assignment and flag configuration
- Management API: CRUD operations for flags, experiments, deployments, and mutex groups

**Data Management APIs**:
- Lookup Table API: CSV-based property augmentation
- Taxonomy API: Event schema management
- SCIM 2.0 API: User provisioning and group management

## Integration Patterns and Ecosystem

**Source Integrations**: 70+ connectors spanning marketing automation (Braze, HubSpot, Intercom), attribution platforms (AppsFlyer, Adjust, Branch), subscription management (RevenueCat, Adapty), and data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Databricks).

**Destination Integrations**: Data routing to marketing platforms, data warehouses, and third-party analytics tools through the Destination Catalog with real-time streaming and batch processing capabilities.

**Third-Party Analytics**: Native integrations with Segment, mParticle, Google Analytics, and other platforms through destination plugins and middleware architecture.

**Enterprise Infrastructure**: Warehouse-native capabilities, SCIM provisioning, single sign-on integration, and comprehensive data governance through the broader Amplitude ecosystem.

## Command Line and Development Tools

**Ampli CLI Commands**:
- `ampli pull`: Generate strongly-typed tracking code from tracking plans
