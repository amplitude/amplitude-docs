Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, run experiments, and optimize digital experiences through data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products that work together to provide end-to-end analytics and optimization capabilities.

## Core Product Architecture

The Amplitude ecosystem is built around several key products:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics platform, providing event tracking, user behavior analysis, and comprehensive reporting through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Revenue LTV, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, and Legacy Charts. Each chart type offers specialized analytical capabilities for different use cases.

**Amplitude Experiment** is the behavioral experimentation and feature flag platform that enables A/B testing and progressive feature delivery. It operates on remote and local evaluation modes, supporting both statistical experimentation and feature flagging workflows.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and replays user sessions to provide qualitative insights into user behavior and experience issues.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user engagement through guided experiences and feedback collection.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and routing through source and destination catalogs, audiences, and warehouse-native capabilities.

## Data Infrastructure and Integration

The platform supports comprehensive **data management** through multiple components:

- **Source Catalog**: Integrations for data ingestion from various platforms and services
- **Destination Catalog**: Data routing to external systems and platforms, categorized by integration types
- **Audiences**: User segmentation and cohort management capabilities
- **Warehouse-native Amplitude**: Direct integration with data warehouses
- **PII Integrations**: Privacy-compliant handling of personally identifiable information

## SDK and API Ecosystem

Amplitude provides extensive **instrumentation capabilities** through multiple SDKs:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal implementations, each optimized for their respective platforms and use cases.

**Experiment SDKs** enable feature flag evaluation and A/B testing across different platforms and environments.

**Ampli** provides type-safe analytics implementation with code generation and validation capabilities.

The platform exposes functionality through multiple **API endpoints**:
- Analytics API for data ingestion and retrieval
- Experiment APIs for feature flag and experiment management  
- Guides and Surveys API for in-product experience management

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events and Properties**: The fundamental data model consists of events (user actions) with associated properties (contextual data) tracked through various SDKs.

**Charts and Analysis**: Different visualization and analysis types optimized for specific analytical questions, from basic event segmentation to complex behavioral analysis.

**Experiments and Variants**: A/B testing framework using experiments (test configurations) with variants (different treatments) and statistical analysis capabilities.

**Deployments and Flags**: Feature flag management system using deployment keys for authentication and flags for controlling feature rollouts.

**Cohorts and Audiences**: User segmentation tools for creating and managing user groups based on behavioral criteria.

**Sources and Destinations**: Data pipeline components for ingesting data from external systems and routing processed data to downstream tools.

## Administrative and Governance Features

The platform includes comprehensive **administrative capabilities**:

- **Account Management**: User provisioning, role-based access control, and organizational structure management
- **Single Sign-on**: Enterprise authentication integration
- **Billing and Use**: Usage monitoring and subscription management
- **Migration**: Tools and processes for transitioning from other analytics platforms

## Multi-language and Accessibility

The platform supports **internationalization** with Japanese translation capabilities and accessibility features including helpful content toggles and navigation customization.

## Developer Resources and Support

Comprehensive **documentation and support** includes:

- **Get Started**: Onboarding guides and initial setup instructions
- **FAQ and Troubleshooting**: Common issues and resolution guidance
- **Experiment Troubleshooting**: Specialized support for experimentation workflows
- **Academy Content**: Educational resources and best practices
- **Partners**: Integration ecosystem and third-party collaborations

## URL Structure and Navigation

The platform uses a hierarchical URL structure reflecting the product organization:
- `/analytics/` for core analytics features
- `/feature-experiment/` for experimentation capabilities
- `/sdks/` for development tools and instrumentation
- `/apis/` for programmatic access
- `/data/` for data management features
- `/admin/` for administrative functions

The navigation system uses injection-based organization with nav_title properties that group related functionality and maintain consistent user experience across the platform's extensive feature set.
