# Amplitude Analytics and Experimentation Platform

Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools for product analytics, feature experimentation, user engagement, and data management. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP).

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Amplitude platform is structured around several core product areas that work together to provide end-to-end product intelligence:

**Analytics Core** serves as the foundation, providing event tracking, user behavior analysis, and business intelligence through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Impact Analysis, Engagement Matrix, Revenue LTV, and Experiment Results. These charts are organized under `/analytics/charts/` with specialized routing for each analysis type.

**Amplitude Experiment** operates as the feature flagging and A/B testing engine, with dedicated sections for experiment theory, advanced techniques, workflow management, troubleshooting, and under-the-hood technical details. The platform supports both remote and local evaluation modes through specialized APIs and SDKs.

**Session Replay** provides user session recording and analysis capabilities, enabling teams to understand user behavior through actual session playback and analysis.

**Guides and Surveys** facilitates in-product user engagement through targeted messaging, onboarding flows, and feedback collection mechanisms.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation through source and destination catalogs, audience management, and warehouse-native capabilities.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Collections and Mounting**: The platform uses a collection-based content management system where related documentation is organized into collections. Many collections use "mount" identifiers (UUIDs) to link content hierarchically, enabling nested documentation structures.

**Navigation Injection**: Each collection injects specific navigation titles (`nav_title`) that determine placement in the platform's information architecture, including `analytics`, `experiment`, `data`, `apis`, `get_started`, `admin`, and specialized categories.

**Sites and Propagation**: Content is organized by site (`en` for English, `jp` for Japanese) with propagation controls determining content distribution across locales.

**Route Patterns**: URL structures follow consistent patterns:
- Analytics: `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/{slug}`
- SDKs: `/sdks/{product}/{platform}/{slug}`
- APIs: `/apis/{product}/{slug}`
- Data: `/data/{feature}/{slug}`
- Experiment: `/feature-experiment/{section}/{slug}`

**Blade System**: Certain collections specify "blade" attributes (e.g., "Amplitude Experiment", "Amplitude Session Replay") indicating product-specific branding and feature sets.

**Preview Targets**: All collections include preview functionality with entry-level URL generation and refresh capabilities for content management workflows.

**Date Behavior**: Content visibility is controlled through date-based rules where past content is public and future content remains private until publication.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The Amplitude platform integrates multiple product lines through shared infrastructure and cross-product functionality:

**Unified Analytics Foundation**: All products feed into the core analytics engine, with Session Replay, Experiment, and Guides and Surveys generating events that can be analyzed through the standard chart types and segmentation tools.

**Cross-Product APIs**: The platform provides unified API access across products through `/apis/` endpoints for Analytics, Experiment, and Guides and Surveys, enabling programmatic integration and data exchange.

**Shared SDK Architecture**: Analytics SDKs support multiple platforms (Android, iOS, Browser, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, Unreal) with consistent implementation patterns and the Ampli code generation tool for type-safe analytics implementation.

**Data Integration Layer**: The CDP connects all products through source and destination catalogs, enabling data flow between Amplitude and external systems while maintaining data governance through PII management and warehouse-native capabilities.

**Administrative Unification**: Shared administrative functions include account management, billing and usage tracking, single sign-on integration, and user access controls that span all product areas.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

**Analytics API**: Provides programmatic access to event data, user properties, and behavioral analytics through `/apis/analytics/` endpoints.

**Experiment APIs**: Offers both evaluation and management capabilities through `/apis/experiment/` with support for feature flag management, experiment configuration, and variant assignment.

**Guides and Surveys API**: Enables programmatic control of in-product messaging and survey deployment through `/apis/guides-and-surveys/` endpoints.

**SDK Integration**: Platform-specific SDKs provide consistent event tracking APIs across mobile (Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal), web (Browser), and server-side (Node.js, Python, Java, Go) environments.

**Data Management**: Source and destination catalogs provide pre-built integrations with external systems, while the warehouse-native functionality enables direct data warehouse analysis without data movement.

**Multi-Region Support**: The platform supports data residency requirements with regional deployments and localization capabilities, including Japanese language support.

The platform's architecture emphasizes developer experience through comprehensive SDK coverage, API-first design, and extensive documentation while providing business users with intuitive interfaces for analytics, experimentation, and user engagement across the entire product lifecycle.
