# Amplitude Product Ecosystem

## Product Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and data management platform that helps businesses understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth. The platform enables organizations to collect, manage, analyze, and act on customer data through a suite of integrated products.

## Core Products and Their Relationships

### Amplitude Analytics
The central analytics platform serves as the foundation of the Amplitude ecosystem, providing visualization tools for understanding user behavior:
- Charts for event analysis and segmentation
- Funnels for conversion path analysis
- User sessions and journeys tracking
- Retention and lifecycle analysis
- Revenue and LTV measurement
- Impact analysis for measuring feature performance

### Amplitude Data
Works as the data governance layer that ensures high-quality data flows into Analytics:
- Defines tracking plans that structure how events and properties are collected
- Provides schema validation to maintain data integrity
- Enables data transformations and enrichment before analysis
- Offers visual event labeling for non-technical users
- Provides Ampli developer tools for type-safe implementation

### Amplitude Experiment
Builds on Analytics data to enable feature experimentation:
- Leverages user segments from Analytics for targeted experiments
- Provides both server-side and client-side experimentation capabilities
- Includes feature flags for controlled rollouts
- Feeds experiment results back to Analytics for deeper insights
- Offers SDKs that integrate with Analytics SDKs

### Amplitude CDP (Customer Data Platform)
Acts as the data orchestration layer that connects Analytics with external systems:
- Uses Analytics data to build audiences and segments
- Synchronizes cohorts to external platforms for activation
- Provides identity resolution across touchpoints
- Integrates data from multiple sources into Analytics
- Offers a destination catalog for third-party connections

### Session Replay
Complements Analytics by providing visual context:
- Captures user interactions that generate the events seen in Analytics
- Integrates with Analytics events for contextual playback
- Supports troubleshooting and UX optimization based on quantitative findings

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Events**: User actions or system occurrences tracked in Amplitude (e.g., "Button Click", "Purchase Completed")
- **Properties**: Attributes associated with events, users, or groups that provide context (e.g., "Button Color", "Purchase Amount")
- **Cohorts**: Segments of users sharing common characteristics or behaviors
- **Tracking Plan**: Specification document defining expected events and properties for consistent implementation
- **Experiment**: A controlled test comparing different variations of a feature
- **Feature Flag**: Toggle for enabling/disabling features for specific users
- **Destination**: External system receiving data or audiences from Amplitude
- **Source**: Data origin point for importing into Amplitude
- **Autocapture**: Automatic tracking of user interactions without manual instrumentation
- **Ampli Wrapper**: Code-generated type-safe wrapper based on tracking plans that ensures consistent implementation

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's products form an integrated ecosystem where:

1. **Data Collection Layer**: SDKs and integrations capture user behavior across platforms
2. **Data Management Layer**: Amplitude Data ensures quality and governance
3. **Analysis Layer**: Amplitude Analytics provides insights from the collected data
4. **Activation Layer**: CDP and Experiment enable taking action on insights
5. **Visualization Layer**: Session Replay provides qualitative context to quantitative data

This ecosystem connects with external tools through:
- Source integrations that bring data into Amplitude
- Destination integrations that send audiences and events to external systems
- Warehouse-native integrations for direct data loading to data warehouses
- API endpoints for custom integrations with other systems

## Technical Implementation Details

### API Endpoints
- **Analytics API**: `https://api.amplitude.com/` - For querying analytics data
- **Taxonomy API**: `https://api.amplitude.com/taxonomy/` - For managing tracking plans
- **Experiment API**: `https://api.amplitude.com/experiment/` - For managing experiments and feature flags
- **HTTP API**: `https://api.amplitude.com/2/httpapi` - For sending events

### SDK Implementation
Initialization pattern across SDKs:
```javascript
// Browser SDK example
amplitude.init('API_KEY', {
  serverUrl: 'https://api.amplitude.com/',
  logLevel: 3,
  // Additional configuration options
});
```

Event tracking pattern:
```javascript
amplitude.track('Event Name', {
  property1: 'value1',
  property2: 'value2'
});
```

User identification:
```javascript
amplitude.setUserId('user_123');
amplitude.setUserProperties({
  name: 'John Doe',
  plan: 'premium'
});
```

The Amplitude platform provides a comprehensive suite of tools that work together to help businesses collect quality data, derive meaningful insights, and take action to improve product experiences and drive growth.
