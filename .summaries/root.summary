Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven decision making. The platform consists of several interconnected products: Analytics (foundational behavioral analysis), Experiment (feature flagging and A/B testing), Session Replay (user session recording), Guides and Surveys (in-product messaging), and a Customer Data Platform (CDP) for data management.

## Product Architecture and Relationships

The platform is built around **Amplitude Analytics** as the core foundation, providing event tracking, user segmentation, and behavioral analysis capabilities. **Amplitude Experiment** integrates directly with Analytics data for feature flagging and experimentation. **Session Replay** provides qualitative context to quantitative Analytics insights. **Guides and Surveys** enables closed-loop feedback collection based on Analytics segments. The **CDP** serves as the data backbone, handling ingestion, transformation, and routing across all products and external systems.

The architecture supports multi-site deployment with English and Japanese localization, featuring content propagation controls and site-specific configurations for global market presence.

## Analytics and Visualization Ecosystem

Amplitude Analytics provides an extensive suite of chart types organized into distinct categories:

**Core Analysis Charts**: Event Segmentation (user action analysis), Funnel Analysis (conversion tracking), Retention Analysis (user return behavior), User Sessions (session-based metrics)

**Advanced Analytics**: Compass (metric monitoring/alerting), Journeys (user path analysis), Impact Analysis (feature effect measurement), Lifecycle (user state transitions), Personas (behavioral clustering), Stickiness (engagement frequency)

**Revenue Analytics**: Revenue LTV (customer lifetime value), Data Tables (flexible reporting)

**Specialized Tools**: Engagement Matrix (cross-feature usage), Legacy Charts (backward compatibility)

## SDK and Integration Framework

The platform provides comprehensive SDK coverage across development environments:

**Client-Side SDKs**: Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Unity, Unreal
**Server-Side SDKs**: Node.js, Python, Java, Go
**Specialized Tools**: Ampli (type-safe analytics with code generation)

## API Infrastructure

Multiple API surfaces serve different product areas:
- **Analytics API** (`/apis/analytics/{slug}`): Event data, user properties, chart results
- **Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/{slug}`): Feature flag management, experiment configuration  
- **Guides and Surveys API** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/{slug}`): In-product messaging automation

## Data Management and CDP Capabilities

The **Customer Data Platform** handles end-to-end data lifecycle management. **Source Catalog** provides pre-built integrations for data collection from various platforms. **Destination Catalog** enables data forwarding to downstream tools with integration categorization and filtering.

**Audiences** functionality creates behavioral user segments with real-time updates and cross-platform activation. **Warehouse-native Amplitude** supports direct data warehouse querying. **PII Integrations** provide specialized handling of personally identifiable information with compliance controls.

## Experimentation and Feature Management

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers comprehensive A/B testing and feature flagging with multi-platform SDK support. The system includes **Advanced Techniques** for sophisticated experimental design, **Experiment Theory** for statistical methodology, and **Under the Hood** technical implementation details.

**Workflow** management tracks experiment lifecycle from hypothesis to results. **Experiment Results** charts provide specialized experimental data visualization. **Web Experiment** enables browser-based experimentation without code deployment.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events**: User actions tracked within applications
**Properties**: Attributes associated with events or users  
**Segments**: Filtered user subsets based on behavioral/demographic criteria
**Cohorts**: Saved, reusable user segments
**Funnels**: Multi-step conversion process tracking
**Retention**: User return behavior measurement over time
**LTV (Lifetime Value)**: Long-term user value calculation
**Stickiness**: Engagement frequency within time periods
**Feature Flags**: Feature availability and rollout controls
**Variants**: Different experimental conditions
**Allocation**: User assignment to experimental groups

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates into the broader marketing and product technology stack through its CDP capabilities, supporting data flow to/from CRMs, marketing automation platforms, data warehouses, and business intelligence tools. The **Partners** ecosystem enables third-party integrations and marketplace extensions.

**Source Catalog** and **Destination Catalog** provide extensive pre-built connectors, positioning Amplitude as a central hub in the customer data infrastructure. **Warehouse-native** capabilities allow organizations to maintain data in their existing warehouse while leveraging Amplitude's analytics capabilities.

## Administrative and Technical Infrastructure

**Account Management** provides organization-level controls and user administration. **Single Sign-on** supports enterprise authentication systems. **Billing and Use** tracking enables usage monitoring and cost management.

The platform uses **mount** identifiers (UUIDs) for content organization, **preview targets** for content validation, and **blade** identifiers for product area association. Route patterns follow RESTful conventions with dynamic slug-based URLs (`/apis/{product}/{slug}`, `/content/{area}/{topic}`).

**Navigation injection** provides consistent site structure, while **date behavior** controls content visibility based on publication timing. The system supports both flat and hierarchical content structures with flexible routing configurations for optimal developer and user experience.
