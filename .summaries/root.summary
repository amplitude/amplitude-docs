Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides product teams with tools for user behavior analysis, feature experimentation, data management, and user engagement. The platform consists of several interconnected products that work together to deliver insights across the entire user journey.

## Core Product Architecture

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, offering multiple chart types for behavioral analysis including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Stickiness, Lifecycle, Personas, Compass, Impact Analysis, Revenue LTV, Engagement Matrix, Data Tables, and Experiment Results. Each chart type provides specialized visualization and analysis capabilities for different aspects of user behavior.

**Amplitude Experiment** is the feature flagging and experimentation platform that enables A/B testing, feature rollouts, and advanced experimentation techniques. It includes experiment theory documentation, workflow management, advanced techniques, troubleshooting guides, and "under the hood" technical implementation details.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and replays user sessions to provide qualitative insights into user behavior and identify friction points in the user experience.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** delivers in-product user engagement through contextual messaging, onboarding flows, feedback collection, and help documentation via an integrated Resource Center.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages data ingestion, transformation, and activation through sources, destinations, audiences, and warehouse-native capabilities. It includes comprehensive source and destination catalogs with integration taxonomies.

## SDK and API Ecosystem

The platform provides extensive SDK coverage across multiple programming languages and platforms:

**Analytics SDKs** include Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal implementations, each with platform-specific features and installation methods.

**Experiment SDKs** offer feature flagging capabilities across the same platform ecosystem with consistent APIs for flag evaluation and user targeting.

**Ampli** serves as a type-safe wrapper that generates strongly-typed analytics libraries based on tracking plans, ensuring data quality and consistency across implementations.

**APIs** provide programmatic access to Analytics, Experiment, and Guides and Surveys functionality, enabling custom integrations and automated workflows.

## Data Management and Integration

The **Source Catalog** includes integrations for data ingestion from various platforms, categorized by integration types and supporting different data collection methods.

The **Destination Catalog** enables data activation by sending processed data to downstream tools and platforms, also organized by integration categories.

**Audiences** functionality allows creation of user segments based on behavioral criteria, which can be synced to external platforms for marketing activation.

**Warehouse-native Amplitude** enables analysis of data directly within customer data warehouses without requiring data export.

**PII Integrations** provide specialized handling for personally identifiable information with appropriate privacy and security controls.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events** are user actions tracked within applications, forming the foundation of all analytics.

**Properties** are attributes associated with events or users that provide additional context for analysis.

**Cohorts/Audiences** are user segments defined by behavioral or demographic criteria.

**Funnels** track user progression through defined sequences of events.

**Retention** measures user return behavior over specified time periods.

**Experiments** are controlled tests comparing different user experiences or features.

**Feature Flags** enable dynamic control of application features without code deployments.

**Charts** are visualization and analysis tools for exploring user behavior data.

**Journeys** map user paths through applications to identify common flows and drop-off points.

**Personas** create behavioral user segments based on action patterns.

**Lifecycle** tracks user progression through engagement stages.

## Administrative and Management Features

**Account Management** provides organizational controls, user permissions, and access management.

**Billing and Use** tracks platform usage and manages subscription details.

**Single Sign-on** enables enterprise authentication integration.

**Admin** functions include general platform configuration and management tools.

The platform includes comprehensive **FAQ and Troubleshooting** resources, **Migration** guides for platform transitions, and **Academy Content** for user education.

## Broader Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates with the broader product development ecosystem through **Partners** integrations, enabling connections with complementary tools and platforms.

**Agents** functionality (specific implementation details not fully detailed in the provided files) appears to provide automated or AI-driven capabilities within the platform.

The platform supports **Japanese Translation** with localized content and documentation, indicating global market support.

**Legacy Charts** maintain backward compatibility with older visualization types while the platform evolves.

## Technical Implementation

The platform uses consistent routing patterns across collections:
- Analytics: `/analytics/{slug}`
- Experiment: `/feature-experiment/{slug}`
- APIs: `/apis/{category}/{slug}`
- SDKs: `/sdks/{category}/{slug}`
- Data: `/data/{category}/{slug}`

Collections support preview functionality, URL-based routing, and hierarchical content organization with navigation injection for consistent user experience across the documentation ecosystem.

The platform maintains separate content structures for different locales (English and Japanese) with propagation controls and site-specific configurations.
