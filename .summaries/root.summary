Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to make data-driven product decisions through integrated analytics, A/B testing, customer data management, and user engagement tools.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem centers around four core product pillars that work synergistically:

**Analytics Foundation**: Amplitude Analytics serves as the primary product, offering event-based behavioral analysis through specialized chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Personas, Compass, Data Tables, Impact Analysis, Revenue LTV, and Engagement Matrix. These visualization tools enable teams to understand user behavior patterns, conversion optimization, and product performance metrics.

**Experimentation Infrastructure**: Amplitude Experiment provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with comprehensive workflow management, advanced statistical techniques, and troubleshooting tools. The platform supports both server-side and client-side experimentation with dedicated SDKs for seamless integration.

**Data Management Layer**: The Customer Data Platform (CDP) functionality orchestrates data flow through sources and destinations, audience management, warehouse-native capabilities, and PII handling. This layer manages the complete data lifecycle from ingestion through transformation to activation across external systems.

**Developer Ecosystem**: Extensive SDK support spans Android, iOS, Browser (JavaScript), React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine platforms. The Ampli developer tool generates type-safe analytics implementations, while comprehensive APIs enable programmatic platform access.

**Specialized Products**: Session Replay captures and analyzes user session recordings, while Guides and Surveys enables in-product user research and engagement campaigns. These products integrate seamlessly with core analytics for enhanced user insights.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Events and Properties**: The foundational data model consists of events (discrete user actions) and properties (descriptive attributes for events, users, or groups). All analytics and experimentation analysis builds upon this event-driven architecture.

**Charts and Visualizations**: Pre-configured analysis templates that enable specific behavioral analysis patterns, from basic event tracking to complex multi-step conversion analysis and longitudinal cohort studies.

**Feature Flags and Experiments**: Feature flags control progressive feature rollouts and enable controlled testing, while experiments provide statistical analysis of variant performance with proper randomization and significance testing methodologies.

**Cohorts and Audiences**: Dynamically defined user segments based on behavioral criteria or property values, used for targeted analysis and experiment population assignment.

**Sources and Destinations**: Integration endpoints where sources import data into Amplitude (via SDKs, APIs, or third-party connectors) and destinations export processed data to external activation systems.

**Instrumentation**: The implementation process for event tracking code within applications, supported by platform-specific SDKs and the Ampli code generation tool for type-safe, validated implementations.

## Ecosystem Integration and Workflow

Amplitude integrates into broader product development and marketing technology stacks through multiple integration points. The platform supports first-party data collection via native SDKs and third-party data ingestion through an extensive source catalog covering marketing automation, customer success, and product analytics tools.

The typical implementation workflow progresses from instrumentation planning and SDK integration, through analytics dashboard configuration and behavioral analysis, to hypothesis-driven experimentation and feature development. Experiment results inform product roadmap decisions, creating a continuous feedback loop that drives iterative product improvement.

Administrative capabilities encompass account management, billing and usage monitoring, single sign-on integration, and partner ecosystem management. Enterprise features include comprehensive access controls, data governance tools, and advanced integration capabilities.

The platform architecture emphasizes developer experience through comprehensive documentation, multiple implementation pathways, and extensive third-party integrations. Multi-language support includes Japanese localization, while academy content provides structured learning resources for platform adoption and analytics best practices.

The hierarchical routing structure organizes content by major product areas (analytics, experiment, data, admin) with specialized sub-sections, enabling teams to locate relevant documentation based on specific use cases and technical requirements. Mount point UUIDs in the collection files indicate a content management system that supports dynamic routing and personalized documentation experiences.
