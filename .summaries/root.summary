Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides organizations with tools for product analytics, feature experimentation, customer data management, and user engagement optimization. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products designed to help teams understand user behavior, test product changes, and drive data-driven decision making.

## Core Product Architecture and Relationships

The Amplitude ecosystem is built around several primary product areas that work together to provide end-to-end analytics and experimentation capabilities:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational product, providing event tracking, user analytics, and behavioral insights through various chart types including Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Cohort Analysis, and specialized visualizations like Compass, Journeys, and Personas. The analytics platform supports both real-time and historical analysis with advanced segmentation capabilities.

**Amplitude Experiment** operates as the feature flagging and A/B testing platform, enabling teams to run controlled experiments, manage feature rollouts, and measure impact. It includes experiment design tools, statistical analysis capabilities, advanced targeting, and integration with the analytics platform for comprehensive result analysis.

**Amplitude CDP (Customer Data Platform)** functions as the data infrastructure layer, managing data ingestion, transformation, and distribution through Sources, Destinations, Audiences, and warehouse-native capabilities. It provides data governance, real-time streaming, and integration with external systems.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and analyzes user sessions to provide qualitative insights into user behavior, complementing the quantitative analytics data.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product messaging and user feedback collection to drive engagement and gather user insights.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Analytics Concepts
- **Events** - User actions tracked within applications (page views, clicks, purchases)
- **Properties** - Attributes associated with events (event properties) or users (user properties)
- **Segments** - Filtered groups of users or events based on specific criteria
- **Cohorts** - Groups of users who performed specific actions within defined time periods
- **Funnels** - Sequential analysis of user progression through defined steps
- **Retention** - Analysis of user return behavior over time periods
- **LTV (Lifetime Value)** - Revenue analysis and user value calculations

### Experimentation Terminology
- **Feature Flags** - Boolean toggles controlling feature availability
- **Variants** - Different versions of features being tested in experiments
- **Allocation** - Percentage of users assigned to experiment variants
- **Statistical Significance** - Confidence level in experiment results
- **Holdout Groups** - Control groups excluded from feature exposure

### Data Management
- **Sources** - Data ingestion points from applications, websites, or third-party tools
- **Destinations** - External systems receiving processed data from Amplitude
- **Transformations** - Data processing rules applied during ingestion
- **Schemas** - Data structure definitions for events and properties
- **Tracking Plans** - Standardized event specifications for consistent implementation

### Technical Infrastructure
- **Device ID** - Persistent identifier for anonymous user tracking
- **User ID** - Known user identifier for authenticated experiences
- **Session ID** - Temporary identifier grouping related user actions
- **Amplitude ID** - Internal user identifier combining device and user IDs
- **Server Zone** - Data residency configuration (US/EU regions)

## SDK and API Integration Methods

### Analytics SDKs
The platform provides comprehensive SDK coverage across platforms:
- **Browser SDK** (`@amplitude/analytics-browser`) - JavaScript/TypeScript web implementation
- **Mobile SDKs** - iOS (`@amplitude/analytics-ios`), Android (`@amplitude/analytics-android`), React Native, Flutter
- **Server-side SDKs** - Node.js, Python, Java, Go for backend event tracking
- **Game Engine SDKs** - Unity, Unreal Engine for gaming applications

### Core API Endpoints
- **HTTP V2 API** (`https://api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`) - Primary event ingestion endpoint
- **Batch API** (`https://api2.amplitude.com/batch`) - Bulk event submission
- **Identify API** (`https://api2.amplitude.com/identify`) - User property updates
- **Analytics API** (`https://amplitude.com/api/`) - Data export and analysis queries
- **Experiment API** (`https://api.lab.amplitude.com/`) - Feature flag and experiment management

### Key Integration Patterns
```javascript
// Analytics initialization
amplitude.init('API_KEY', {
  serverZone: 'US',
  defaultTracking: true,
  autocapture: { sessions: true, pageViews: true }
});

// Event tracking
amplitude.track('Purchase Completed', {
  product_id: 'SKU123',
  revenue: 29.99,
  category: 'Electronics'
});

// User identification
amplitude.identify(new Identify()
  .set('subscription_plan', 'premium')
  .add('total_purchases', 1)
);
```

### Ampli Code Generation
- `ampli pull` - Generate type-safe tracking code from Data tracking plans
- `ampli status` - Validate implementation against defined schemas
- `ampli install` - Set up Ampli wrapper for specific platforms

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates extensively with external tools and platforms through its destination catalog and source integrations:

**Marketing and Advertising Platforms** including Google Ads, Facebook Ads, Braze, Iterable, and Salesforce for audience synchronization and campaign optimization.

**Data Warehouses** such as Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, and Databricks for advanced analytics and data science workflows through warehouse-native capabilities.

**Customer Support and Success Tools** like Zendesk, Intercom, and Gainsight for customer experience optimization.

**Development and Product Tools** including Slack, Jira, and GitHub for workflow integration and automated reporting.

**Privacy and Compliance** features support GDPR, CCPA, and other regulations through consent management, data deletion capabilities, and PII handling controls.

The platform emphasizes **Multi-site and Internationalization** support with Japanese localization, multi-region data residency options, and enterprise-grade security features including Single Sign-On (SSO), role-based access control, and audit logging.

**Administrative Capabilities** encompass account management, billing and usage monitoring, team collaboration features, and comprehensive troubleshooting resources. The platform provides extensive migration support for teams transitioning from other analytics platforms, with dedicated guides for moving from Google Analytics, Mixpanel, and other solutions.

The ecosystem is designed to scale from startup implementations to enterprise deployments, with flexible pricing models, advanced governance features, and professional services support for complex implementations.
