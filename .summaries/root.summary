# Amplitude Product Suite

## Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics platform that helps organizations understand user behavior, optimize digital experiences, and drive business growth through data-driven insights. The platform collects, analyzes, visualizes, and activates user data across multiple channels, enabling teams to make informed product decisions based on actual user behavior.

## Product Relationships and Architecture

The Amplitude Product Suite consists of five core products that work together as an integrated ecosystem:

1. **Analytics** - The foundation of the platform that provides tools for tracking and analyzing user behavior
2. **Data** - Handles data collection, management, governance, and integration
3. **Experiment** - Enables feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities
4. **Session Replay** - Provides visual recordings of user sessions for qualitative insights
5. **Guides and Surveys** - Facilitates in-product messaging and feedback collection

These products form a closed-loop system:
- Data is collected through SDKs and integrations
- Analytics processes and visualizes this data
- Experiment tests hypotheses derived from analytics
- Session Replay provides qualitative context to quantitative data
- Guides and Surveys activate insights through targeted messaging

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

### Data Model Concepts
- **Events**: User actions tracked in Amplitude (page views, clicks, purchases)
- **Event Properties**: Contextual attributes associated with events
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes associated with users
- **Group Properties**: Attributes associated with organizations or accounts
- **Cohorts**: Groups of users defined by specific behaviors or attributes
- **Sessions**: Periods of continuous user activity
- **Monthly Tracked Users (MTU)**: Unique users tracked per month (billing metric)

### Analytics Concepts
- **Funnels**: Sequential series of events tracking conversion paths
- **Retention**: Measurement of continued user engagement over time
- **Pathfinder**: Analysis of user navigation patterns
- **Segmentation**: Breaking down metrics by user attributes
- **Notebooks**: Collaborative analysis documents combining charts and text

### Experiment Concepts
- **Variants**: Different versions of a feature in experiments
- **Bucketing**: Process of assigning users to experiment variants
- **Sequential Testing**: Methodology for faster experiment results
- **Feature Flags**: Toggles for controlling feature availability

### Data Management Concepts
- **Tracking Plan**: Schema defining expected events and properties
- **Ampli Wrapper**: Generated code providing type-safe analytics implementation
- **Transformations**: Rules for modifying data during processing
- **Derived Properties**: Calculated attributes based on existing data

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates with the broader product ecosystem in several ways:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Client-side SDKs for web, mobile, and desktop platforms
   - Server-side SDKs for backend implementations
   - HTTP API for custom integrations
   - Warehouse-native capabilities for direct data warehouse querying

2. **Data Connections**:
   - Source integrations import data from external platforms
   - Destination integrations export cohorts and events to activation platforms
   - Reverse ETL capabilities for data warehouse integration

3. **Development Workflow**:
   - Ampli CLI generates type-safe wrappers based on tracking plans
   - SDK plugins extend functionality for specific use cases
   - API endpoints for programmatic access to Amplitude data

4. **Cross-Product Features**:
   - Unified user identity across all products
   - Consistent data model shared by all platform components
   - Integrated permissions and access controls
   - Cross-linking between products (e.g., from analytics to session replay)

## API and Implementation Details

Amplitude provides multiple implementation options:

1. **Analytics API Endpoints**:
   - `/api/2/httpapi` for event ingestion
   - `/api/2/export` for raw data export
   - `/api/2/taxonomy` for tracking plan management

2. **Experiment SDK Methods**:
   - `fetch()` for retrieving flag values
   - `evaluate()` for determining variant assignments
   - `exposure()` for tracking experiment exposures

3. **Ampli CLI Commands**:
   - `ampli pull` to fetch tracking plan
   - `ampli status` to check implementation status
   - `ampli generate` to create type-safe wrappers

4. **Session Replay Implementation**:
   - Privacy controls with configurable masking levels
   - Cross-platform support (Web, iOS, Android, React Native)
   - Integration with analytics events for context

The platform is available in different tiers (Growth, Enterprise) with varying feature availability and offers specialized add-ons for advanced capabilities like Session Replay and group-level analytics.
