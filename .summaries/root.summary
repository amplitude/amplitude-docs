Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics platform that provides organizations with advanced product analytics, experimentation capabilities, and user behavior insights through an integrated suite of tools including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, and Guides and Surveys.

## Core Product Architecture

The Amplitude ecosystem consists of four primary products that work together to provide end-to-end user experience optimization:

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, built on an event-driven architecture where user interactions are captured as discrete events with associated properties. The platform supports both individual user-level and account-level analytics through group types and values, enabling analysis at organizational scales.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities with advanced statistical analysis, including sequential testing, CUPED variance reduction, and multi-armed bandit optimization. The platform supports both client-side and server-side experimentation with real-time flag evaluation.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures qualitative user session recordings synchronized with quantitative event streams, providing visual context for user behavior analysis with 90-day retention periods.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** enables in-product user engagement through targeted messaging and feedback collection, integrated with the broader analytics ecosystem.

## Product Relationships and Feature Integration

The products integrate seamlessly through shared data infrastructure and cross-product workflows. Analytics charts can display experiment results through dedicated Experiment Results visualizations, while Session Replay recordings are accessible directly from Analytics charts, User Lookup, and dashboard widgets. The Customer Data Platform (CDP) serves as the central data hub, managing data ingestion, transformation, and distribution across destinations through the Source and Destination Catalogs.

Ampli provides a code-generation layer that creates type-safe analytics implementations across multiple programming languages, ensuring consistent event tracking and reducing implementation errors. The platform supports extensive SDK coverage including Browser, Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, and Unreal Engine implementations.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Behavioral Cohorts**: Dynamic user segments based on shared behaviors and traits within specific time periods, supporting complex temporal parameters (during, since, within) and logical operators, with limits of five cohorts for Plus users.

**Group Types and Values**: Core components of account-level reporting where group types represent categories (e.g., "company") and group values represent specific instances (e.g., "Amplitude Inc"), limited to five group types per project.

**Feature Flags**: Boolean or multivariate configuration values that control feature availability and behavior in real-time, managed through Amplitude Experiment with support for percentage rollouts, user targeting, and dependency management.

**Variant Allocation**: The process of assigning users to different experiment variations based on consistent hashing algorithms, ensuring stable user experiences across sessions while maintaining statistical validity.

**Historical Count**: A specialized Analytics filter tracking the Nth instance (up to 5th) of user actions with a one-year lookback period, supporting specific operators for advanced behavioral analysis.

**Microscope**: A data inspection tool enabling detailed analysis of chart data points through hover/click interactions, providing access to user streams, path analysis, and cohort creation.

**Channel Classifiers**: Sequential rule-based systems for marketing analytics that determine marketing channels using UTM parameters and referrer values.

**Mutual Information**: A statistical measure used in Experiment's significance detection to identify the most impactful user properties and events that differentiate between experiment variants.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude integrates extensively with external platforms through multiple integration patterns. The platform supports over 100 destinations in the Destination Catalog, including major marketing, analytics, and data warehouse platforms. Source integrations enable data collection from various platforms including Salesforce, Zendesk, and custom HTTP sources.

The platform provides robust API infrastructure with multiple endpoints:
- **Analytics APIs**: HTTP V2, Batch, Identify, and Group Identify APIs for event ingestion and user property management
- **Experiment APIs**: Management API for flag configuration, Assignment API for variant retrieval, and Evaluation API for server-side flag resolution
- **Dashboard REST API**: Enables external access to chart data and powers integrations like Google Drive Sync
- **Guides and Surveys API**: Manages in-product messaging and survey campaigns

Third-party integrations include Atlassian Smart Links for chart previews in Confluence and Jira, Slack integration for notifications and chart unfurling, and Google Drive Sync for automated data exports to Google Sheets and Slides.

## API Endpoints and Technical Implementation

Key technical endpoints include:

**Analytics APIs**:
- `api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi` - HTTP V2 event ingestion
- `api2.amplitude.com/batch` - Bulk event processing
- `api2.amplitude.com/identify` - User property updates
- `api2.amplitude.com/groupidentify` - Account-level property management

**Experiment APIs**:
- Management API for flag configuration and experiment setup
- Assignment API (`/sdk/vardata`) for client-side variant retrieval
- Evaluation API for server-side flag resolution

**Command Line Tools**:
- Ampli CLI for code generation and validation
- Various SDK-specific CLI tools for debugging and testing

The platform supports domain proxy configurations for organizations requiring custom routing, comprehensive debugging tools including the Ingestion Debugger and Chrome Instrumentation Explorer, and extensive webhook capabilities for real-time data streaming.

## Advanced Capabilities and Governance

Amplitude provides sophisticated data governance through hierarchical permission systems with space-level, project-level, and content-specific access controls. Content can be marked as discoverable/unlisted, official (Enterprise tier), or templated for reuse across teams.

The platform includes AI-powered features through Ask Amplitude, which provides conversational interfaces for chart creation and navigation using Amazon Bedrock LLM API. Advanced analytics capabilities include Prophet-based machine learning for anomaly detection and forecasting, Root Cause Analysis for automated investigation of data anomalies, and sophisticated statistical methods for experiment analysis.

Feature availability is tiered across Starter, Plus, Growth, and Enterprise plans, with advanced capabilities like account-level reporting, anomaly detection, enhanced collaboration controls, and enterprise security features available on higher tiers. The platform maintains specific operational limits including 50MB cohort import limits, 1000 property limits for account-level reporting, and various chart-specific restrictions for advanced features.
