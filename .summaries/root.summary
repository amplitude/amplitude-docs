Amplitude Experiment is a feature flagging and experimentation platform that enables controlled feature rollouts and A/B testing through sophisticated access controls and project-based organization. The platform operates independently from other Amplitude products while integrating strategically within the broader ecosystem.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The platform centers on a **project-centric architecture** where experiments and feature flags are organized within discrete projects, each maintaining independent permission structures and operational boundaries.

**Flag Management System** serves as the core control mechanism, with feature flags acting as the fundamental unit for controlling feature visibility and experimentation. Enterprise customers receive additional flag-level access restrictions for granular security control over sensitive features.

**Role-Based Access Control** implements a four-tier hierarchical permission system that governs user capabilities across the platform:
- **Viewer**: Read-only access to flags and experiments
- **Member**: Flag creation, editing, and deployment management
- **Manager**: Member permissions plus user management and project configuration
- **Admin**: Complete project control including deletion rights and advanced configurations

**API Integration Layer** provides programmatic access through the Management API, enabling automated workflows and CI/CD integrations while maintaining proper authentication and audit trails. The API can bypass standard UI permissions while respecting project-level security boundaries.

**Project Isolation Framework** ensures cross-project security through independent permission structures, preventing unauthorized access across project boundaries and supporting multi-team organizational structures.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Project-Level Permissions**: Access control system specific to individual Experiment projects, operating independently from Amplitude Analytics permissions and governing all user actions within project boundaries.

**Flag-Level Access Controls**: Enterprise-exclusive feature enabling restriction of specific flags to designated editors, providing granular security that overrides standard role permissions for sensitive feature releases.

**Restricted Flags**: Enterprise-only feature flags with limited editor access, creating security exceptions to standard role-based permissions for high-sensitivity features.

**Mutual Exclusion Groups**: Feature groupings that prevent conflicting experiments from running simultaneously, requiring specific permission levels for creation and management.

**Management API Bypass**: Programmatic interface capability that circumvents UI-based permission restrictions while maintaining authentication requirements and project-level access validation.

**Deployment Management**: Role-restricted capabilities for pushing flag changes to production environments, ensuring only authorized users can affect live systems.

**Project API Key Management**: Permission-controlled access to project-specific authentication credentials, maintaining security isolation for programmatic interactions across different projects and teams.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude Experiment integrates within the Amplitude ecosystem while maintaining operational autonomy through several key integration points:

**Amplitude Analytics Separation**: Independent permission systems allow organizations to implement different access patterns between experimentation and analytics teams, supporting specialized workflow requirements without permission conflicts.

**Organization-Wide Inheritance**: Project permissions inherit baseline settings from organization-level configurations, providing consistent default access while enabling project-specific customization for unique security requirements.

**Enterprise Security Framework**: Advanced customers access enhanced security features including flag-level restrictions, detailed audit capabilities, and sophisticated access controls that integrate with broader enterprise security policies.

**Cross-Project Security Isolation**: Independent permission structures ensure that user access in one project cannot compromise security in another project within the same organization.

## Technical Implementation and API Access

The platform enforces access controls across multiple operational dimensions through both UI and programmatic interfaces. The **Management API** provides comprehensive programmatic access that respects permission boundaries while enabling automation capabilities for CI/CD pipelines, automated deployment tools, and custom development workflows.

API endpoints facilitate integration with external systems while maintaining security boundaries through project-level authentication and comprehensive audit logging for compliance and security monitoring requirements. The system supports automated workflows through API access that bypasses UI restrictions while maintaining proper authentication and project-level access validation.
