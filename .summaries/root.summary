Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that provides product teams with integrated tools for behavioral analysis, feature experimentation, customer data management, and user engagement optimization. The platform operates as a unified ecosystem where multiple specialized products share common data models and analytical frameworks.

## Core Product Architecture and Integration

The platform consists of five primary product areas that function both independently and as integrated components:

**Analytics Core** serves as the foundational behavioral analysis engine, offering specialized visualization and analysis capabilities through dedicated chart types including Event Segmentation for granular user action tracking, Funnel Analysis for conversion optimization, Retention Analysis for engagement measurement, User Sessions and Journeys for behavioral path analysis, and Revenue LTV for monetization insights. Advanced analytical capabilities are delivered through Compass, Lifecycle, Personas, Stickiness charts, Engagement Matrix, and Impact Analysis for sophisticated behavioral modeling.

**Amplitude Experiment** provides comprehensive feature flagging and A/B testing infrastructure with native analytics integration, statistical analysis frameworks, advanced targeting mechanisms, dedicated experiment chart types, and complete workflow management spanning the entire experimentation lifecycle from hypothesis to statistical significance.

**Session Replay** captures and analyzes complete user session recordings, providing qualitative behavioral insights that complement the platform's quantitative analytics data for comprehensive user experience understanding.

**Guides and Surveys** enables in-product messaging, user onboarding flows, and feedback collection mechanisms for direct user engagement and research initiatives.

**Customer Data Platform (CDP)** manages end-to-end data operations including comprehensive source and destination catalogs for third-party integrations, audience segmentation capabilities, data governance with PII management controls, and warehouse-native functionality for organizations with existing data infrastructure.

## Technical Architecture and System Design

The platform employs a sophisticated documentation and system architecture built around several key technical concepts:

**Collections Structure** organizes content hierarchically with systematic routing patterns such as `/analytics/charts/{chart-type}/{slug}` and `/feature-experiment/{category}/{slug}`, enabling programmatic content discovery and navigation across the platform's extensive feature set.

**Mount Points** utilize UUID-based identifiers to establish cross-references and relationships between documentation sections, creating a interconnected knowledge graph across different product areas and enabling contextual content recommendations.

**Navigation Injection** implements product-specific navigation contexts through `nav_title` designations including `analytics`, `experiment`, `data`, and `apis`, providing users with contextually relevant browsing experiences based on their current product focus.

**Blade Architecture** supports product-specific functionality and branding through a tagging system that enables collections to be associated with individual products like "Amplitude Experiment", "Amplitude Session Replay", and "Amplitude Guides and Surveys", allowing for customized user experiences while maintaining platform coherence.

**Site Propagation** provides multi-language documentation support with English as the primary language and Japanese translations, featuring controlled propagation settings that manage content distribution across different regional deployments.

## SDK Ecosystem and Implementation Framework

Amplitude provides extensive SDK coverage across development platforms and environments:

**Analytics SDK Implementation** offers comprehensive instrumentation capabilities including Browser SDK with advanced autocapture and attribution functionality, native mobile SDKs for iOS, Android, React Native, and Flutter, server-side integration SDKs for Node.js, Python, Java, and Go, and specialized gaming platform SDKs for Unity and Unreal Engine.

**Ampli Code Generation** represents a sophisticated approach to tracking implementation, generating type-safe, strongly-typed SDKs from predefined data schemas to ensure tracking consistency and reduce implementation errors across development teams.

**Experiment SDKs** provide dedicated feature flagging and experimentation capabilities with consistent experiment evaluation logic across all supported platforms, ensuring uniform user experiences regardless of implementation environment.

## API Infrastructure and Integration Points

The platform exposes comprehensive RESTful API interfaces organized by functional area:

- **Analytics APIs** (`/apis/analytics/`) handle data ingestion, query execution, and behavioral data retrieval
- **Experiment APIs** (`/apis/experiment/`) manage feature flag configuration, experiment setup, and evaluation logic
- **Guides and Surveys APIs** (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) control in-product messaging and feedback collection workflows

## Enterprise Administration and Governance

**Account Management** provides organization-level administrative controls including user access management, permission systems, and resource allocation across the platform's various products and features.

**Single Sign-On (SSO)** integration enables enterprise authentication systems to provide centralized access control and security management for large-scale deployments.

**Billing and Usage Management** offers detailed consumption monitoring and billing administration for enterprise deployments, supporting usage-based pricing models with granular tracking across different product areas.

**Data Governance Framework** implements comprehensive PII handling, regulatory compliance controls, and configurable data retention policies to meet enterprise security and compliance requirements.

## Integration Ecosystem and Partner Network

**Source Catalog** contains extensive pre-built integrations for data ingestion from various platforms, services, and data sources, organized systematically by integration type and source category to facilitate rapid implementation.

**Destination Catalog** provides comprehensive data export and activation capabilities for marketing automation platforms, analytics tools, and business intelligence systems, enabling data activation across the marketing and product technology stack.

**Partners Program** encompasses third-party integrations and professional services ecosystem, extending platform capabilities through certified implementation partners and specialized integration providers.

**Experiment Integrations** offer platform-specific implementations for feature flag delivery and experiment analysis across different technology stacks and deployment environments.

## User Onboarding and Migration Support

**Get Started Workflows** provide structured onboarding experiences for new users and organizations with guided setup processes that ensure proper implementation and configuration across the platform's various products.

**Migration Guides** offer comprehensive assistance for organizations transitioning from other analytics or experimentation platforms, including detailed data migration strategies and implementation mapping guidance.

**Academy Content** delivers educational resources covering analytics methodology, experimentation best practices, and advanced implementation patterns to ensure users maximize platform value.

**FAQ and Troubleshooting Resources** provide extensive self-service support with platform-specific troubleshooting guides, common implementation patterns, and resolution strategies for typical deployment challenges.

The Amplitude platform architecture emphasizes unified data models and cross-product analytical continuity, enabling organizations to adopt individual components while maintaining comprehensive product intelligence capabilities. The modular design supports both standalone product implementations and fully integrated workflows for end-to-end product optimization and user experience management.
