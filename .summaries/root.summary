Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, run A/B tests, and optimize digital experiences through data-driven insights. The platform consists of several interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a Customer Data Platform (CDP), all unified under a cohesive ecosystem for behavioral analysis and optimization.

## Product Architecture and Feature Relationships

The platform operates through a hierarchical structure centered around Analytics as the core data foundation, with specialized products building upon this base. Analytics provides the fundamental event tracking, user identification, and behavioral measurement capabilities through comprehensive SDKs (Android, iOS, Browser, React Native, Flutter, Node.js, Python, Java, Go, Unity, Unreal) and APIs. This data foundation feeds into multiple analysis modules including Charts (Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, User Sessions, Journeys, Lifecycle, Personas, Stickiness, Revenue LTV, Compass, Data Tables, Engagement Matrix, Impact Analysis, and Experiment Results), which provide specialized visualization and analysis capabilities for different use cases.

Amplitude Experiment builds on the Analytics foundation to provide feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities, utilizing the same user identification and event tracking infrastructure while adding sophisticated targeting, bucketing, and statistical analysis features. The platform supports both remote and local evaluation modes, with remote evaluation leveraging Amplitude's user enrichment capabilities and local evaluation providing sub-millisecond performance through SDK-based evaluation.

The CDP component manages data flow through Sources and Destinations, with extensive integration catalogs supporting data ingestion from various platforms and distribution to downstream tools. This creates a unified data pipeline that feeds all other platform components while enabling data activation across the broader marketing and product technology stack.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Analytics Core Concepts**: Events represent user actions, Properties provide contextual data about events and users, and Cohorts define user segments based on behavioral criteria. The platform distinguishes between user_id (persistent user identifier) and device_id (device-specific identifier) for comprehensive user tracking across sessions and devices.

**Chart Types and Analysis**: Event Segmentation measures event volumes and property distributions, Funnel Analysis tracks conversion through sequential steps, Retention Analysis measures user return behavior, and Lifecycle categorizes users by engagement patterns (New, Current, Returning, Dormant, Resurrected). Advanced charts like Compass provide metric correlation analysis, while Personas enable behavioral clustering and Revenue LTV tracks customer value over time.

**Experiment Framework**: Deployments serve as configuration containers with distinct client-side and server-side types, Flags enable feature toggling and configuration management, while Experiments facilitate hypothesis-driven testing. Bucketing algorithms ensure consistent user assignment using murmur3 hashing, with Allocation controlling experiment participation rates and Variant Distribution determining treatment assignment.

**Data Management**: Sources represent data ingestion points from various platforms, Destinations enable data activation to external tools, and the platform supports both real-time streaming and batch data processing. Warehouse-native capabilities allow direct analysis of data stored in customer data warehouses.

**Administrative Structure**: Organizations contain multiple Projects, each with independent permission structures and data isolation. The platform supports Single Sign-On integration, role-based access controls (Viewer, Member, Manager, Admin), and comprehensive billing and usage monitoring across different product modules.

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The platform operates as an integrated ecosystem where Analytics serves as the foundational data layer, with specialized products leveraging this shared infrastructure. Session Replay captures user interaction recordings that can be analyzed alongside behavioral analytics data, while Guides and Surveys enable in-product messaging and feedback collection with results feeding back into the analytics pipeline.

Cross-product integration occurs through shared user identification, event tracking, and cohort definitions. Experiment targeting can utilize Analytics-derived cohorts and user properties, while Session Replay recordings can be filtered and analyzed using Analytics segments. The CDP ensures consistent data flow across all products while enabling external integrations with marketing automation, customer support, and business intelligence tools.

The platform supports multi-site configurations with localization capabilities (including Japanese translation), Academy Content for user education, and comprehensive Partner integrations. Enterprise features include advanced administrative controls, PII handling capabilities, and sophisticated permission management across product boundaries.

## API Endpoints and Implementation Details

The platform provides extensive API coverage across all product areas. The Analytics API (`/apis/analytics/`) supports event ingestion, user property management, and data export capabilities. The Experiment APIs (`/apis/experiment/`) enable programmatic flag management, user assignment, and statistical result retrieval. The Guides and Surveys API (`/apis/guides-and-surveys/`) facilitates campaign management and response tracking.

SDK implementation follows consistent patterns across platforms, with initialization requiring project-specific API keys and configuration objects. Analytics SDKs support automatic session tracking, user identification, and event batching, while Experiment SDKs provide both synchronous and asynchronous variant fetching with built-in exposure tracking capabilities.

The platform includes comprehensive instrumentation guidance (`/sdks/`), migration tools for platform transitions, and extensive troubleshooting resources. Advanced techniques documentation covers complex implementation scenarios, statistical methodologies, and integration patterns for enterprise deployments.

Administrative APIs support account management, billing monitoring, and single sign-on configuration, while the destination and source catalogs provide pre-built integrations with hundreds of external platforms. The platform maintains backward compatibility through legacy chart support while continuously expanding capabilities through new analysis modules and integration options.
