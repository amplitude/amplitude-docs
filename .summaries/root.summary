## Amplitude Framework Integrations

Amplitude Framework Integrations is a specialized SDK integration suite that enables seamless implementation of analytics and user behavior tracking within modern web development frameworks. The product provides comprehensive documentation and implementation guidance for integrating Amplitude's analytics capabilities into framework-specific architectures, supporting both client-side and server-side analytics deployments across various rendering patterns including server-side rendering, static site generation, and single-page applications.

## Product Relationships and Feature Architecture

The framework integrations operate as implementation bridges connecting Amplitude's core SDK ecosystem with popular development frameworks. The architecture centers on three primary SDK packages that can be deployed individually or in hybrid configurations:

**Core SDK Components:**
- **@amplitude/unified**: Primary unified package providing single-interface access to both client and server-side analytics capabilities
- **@amplitude/analytics-browser**: Specialized browser-side package optimized for frontend event tracking and user interactions
- **@amplitude/analytics-node**: Server-side package designed for backend analytics implementation and server-rendered applications

**Integration Architecture:**
The system supports sophisticated hybrid implementation patterns where client-side and server-side tracking coexist within the same application framework. These integrations leverage framework-specific features including routing systems, middleware integration, environment variable management, and component lifecycle management. The architecture accommodates multiple deployment patterns while maintaining consistent analytics functionality across different execution contexts.

**Framework-Specific Implementations:**
Each framework integration provides tailored implementation patterns that respect the framework's architectural conventions, including component boundaries, rendering lifecycles, and data flow patterns. The integrations handle framework-specific considerations such as hydration, routing transitions, and environment detection.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**SDK Package Terminology:**
- **Unified SDK**: Comprehensive package (@amplitude/unified) combining browser and server-side capabilities in a single interface
- **Browser SDK**: Client-side focused package (@amplitude/analytics-browser) for frontend user interaction tracking
- **Node SDK**: Server-side package (@amplitude/analytics-node) for backend analytics and server-rendered application support

**Framework-Specific Concepts:**
- **App Router**: Next.js 13+ routing system requiring specific client/server component implementation considerations and boundary management
- **Pages Router**: Legacy Next.js routing system with distinct implementation patterns and lifecycle hooks
- **Client-side Configuration**: Browser-based SDK initialization, event tracking setup, and user interaction handling
- **Server-side Configuration**: Backend SDK configuration for server-rendered applications and API route analytics

**Analytics Capabilities:**
- **Autocapture**: Automated tracking system for user interactions including pageViews, elementInteractions, and navigation events
- **Session Replay**: Comprehensive user session recording and playback functionality for behavioral analysis
- **Visual Labeling**: Chrome Extension-based tool enabling visual event configuration without code modifications
- **User Identification**: setUserId functionality for associating analytics events with specific user identities
- **Session Management**: reset capabilities for managing user sessions across application states and authentication changes

**Configuration Elements:**
- **Environment Variables**: Framework-specific variable management systems (e.g., NEXT_PUBLIC_AMPLITUDE_API_KEY for client-side access)
- **Middleware Integration**: Framework routing middleware for seamless analytics implementation across application routes
- **Debug Configuration**: logLevel settings and debugging tools for development environment troubleshooting
- **API Key Management**: Secure handling of Amplitude API keys across client and server environments

## Broader Product Ecosystem Integration

The framework integrations function as a critical implementation layer within Amplitude's comprehensive analytics ecosystem, serving as the primary connection point between modern web development workflows and Amplitude's core analytics infrastructure. The integrations facilitate seamless data flow between multiple ecosystem components:

**Development Environment Integration:**
The integrations provide native support for modern web frameworks and their architectural patterns, including TypeScript and JavaScript development environments, client-server hybrid application architectures, and sophisticated browser compatibility handling with environment detection capabilities.

**Analytics Platform Connection:**
The framework integrations connect directly to Amplitude's core analytics platform for event ingestion and behavioral analysis, Session Replay infrastructure for comprehensive user behavior recording, Visual Labeling tools that enable non-technical team members to configure events, and robust user identification and session management systems.

**Technical Implementation Support:**
The integrations provide specialized handling for complex framework rendering patterns, including server-side rendering considerations with proper hydration support, browser environment detection (handling scenarios where `window` is undefined), and framework-specific routing implementations that ensure analytics continuity across navigation events. This comprehensive support ensures reliable analytics functionality across different execution contexts within modern web applications while maintaining compatibility with various deployment patterns, development workflows, and production environments.

**API Integration Points:**
The framework integrations expose standard Amplitude SDK methods including `track()` for custom event tracking, `setUserId()` for user identification, `reset()` for session management, and configuration methods for SDK initialization, all adapted to work seamlessly within framework-specific component lifecycles and rendering patterns.
