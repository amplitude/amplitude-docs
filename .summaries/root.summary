# Amplitude Product Ecosystem

## Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics platform that enables businesses to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform provides tools for data collection, analysis, experimentation, and data management, allowing organizations to track user interactions, visualize behavior patterns, test hypotheses, and make informed product decisions.

The platform offers robust analytics visualization tools, experimentation capabilities, audience segmentation, and extensive SDK support across multiple platforms. Product teams use Amplitude to answer critical questions about user engagement, conversion, retention, and feature performance.

## Product Relationships and Features

The Amplitude ecosystem consists of several interconnected products:

### 1. Analytics
The core analysis platform offering multiple visualization tools:
- **Chart Types**: Funnel Analysis (conversion paths), Retention Analysis (user return rates), User Sessions (interaction sequences), Journeys (navigation paths), Stickiness (engagement frequency)
- **Compass**: Provides automated product insights and opportunity identification
- **Session Replay**: Visual playback of user journeys for qualitative analysis

### 2. Data Management
Tools for collecting, organizing, and governing analytics data:
- **Sources**: Data ingestion mechanisms from various platforms
- **Audiences**: User segmentation capabilities for targeted analysis
- **CDP** (Customer Data Platform): Unified user profile management
- **PII Integrations**: Handling of sensitive personal information
- **Destination/Source Catalogs**: Connectors for data import/export

### 3. Experimentation
Tools for testing hypotheses and optimizing product experiences:
- **Experiment**: A/B testing platform for comparing variations
- **Web Experiment**: Web-specific experimentation capabilities
- **Experiment APIs/SDKs**: Implementation tools for various platforms
- **Impact Analysis**: Measurement framework for experiment results

### 4. SDKs and APIs
Implementation tools for various platforms:
- **Platform SDKs**: Browser, iOS, Android, Flutter, React Native, Unity, Unreal, Node.js, Python, Java, Go
- **Ampli SDK**: Type-safe wrapper SDK with validation capabilities
- **Analytics APIs**: Programmatic interfaces for data access

### 5. Administration
Tools for account and system management:
- **Account Management**: User permissions and organization settings
- **Billing and Usage**: Subscription and consumption tracking
- **Single Sign-On**: Enterprise authentication integration

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Events**: Discrete user actions tracked within a product (e.g., clicks, page views, transactions)
- **Properties**: Contextual attributes attached to events (e.g., user type, device info)
- **User Sessions**: Grouped sequences of user actions within a defined time period
- **Funnels**: Sequential steps users take toward a conversion goal
- **Retention**: Measurement of users returning to a product over specific time intervals
- **Journeys/Pathfinder**: Visualization tools showing how users navigate through a product
- **Experiment**: Controlled tests comparing different product variations
- **Segments**: Defined subsets of users based on behaviors or attributes
- **Instrumentation**: The implementation process for tracking in applications
- **Warehouse-native**: Integration approach connecting directly to data warehouses

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude's platform functions as an integrated ecosystem with data flowing through several layers:

1. **Data Collection Layer**: SDKs and APIs capture user behavior from applications and send it to Amplitude's processing pipeline.

2. **Data Management Layer**: Sources, CDP, and catalog tools organize and prepare data for analysis, ensuring data quality and governance.

3. **Analysis Layer**: Analytics tools transform raw data into actionable insights through charts, dashboards, and automated analysis.

4. **Action Layer**: Experiment and audience tools enable teams to act on insights through testing and targeted experiences.

The platform supports both real-time analytics for immediate insights and deeper historical analysis for trend identification. Cross-product workflows enable seamless transitions between discovery and validation, such as converting paths discovered in Journeys into Funnels for conversion analysis.

## API Endpoints and Implementation

Amplitude provides multiple implementation approaches:

### SDK Implementation
- **Browser SDK**: `amplitude.getInstance().track('Event Name', {property: value})`
- **Mobile SDKs**: Platform-specific tracking methods
- **Server-side SDKs**: Backend event tracking capabilities

### Ampli SDK
A code-generated wrapper providing type safety and validation:
- Example: `ampli.track("Event Name", {property: value})`

### HTTP API Endpoints
- Event ingestion: `https://api2.amplitude.com/2/httpapi`
- User profile updates: `https://api.amplitude.com/usermap`
- Export API: `https://amplitude.com/api/2/export`

### Experiment Implementation
- Fetch variants: `experiment.variant('experiment-key', 'default-value')`
- Track exposure: `experiment.exposure('experiment-key')`

The documentation supports different user personas from developers implementing tracking to analysts interpreting data, with specialized sections for advanced techniques and troubleshooting.
