Amplitude is a comprehensive digital analytics and experimentation platform that enables organizations to understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive growth through data-driven insights. The platform consists of multiple interconnected products including Analytics, Experiment, Session Replay, Guides and Surveys, and a robust data management layer.

## Core Product Architecture and Relationships

**Amplitude Analytics** serves as the foundational analytics engine, providing behavioral analysis through various chart types and visualization tools. The analytics platform processes event data collected through SDKs and APIs to generate insights about user journeys, retention, conversion, and engagement patterns.

**Amplitude Experiment** delivers feature flagging and A/B testing capabilities, enabling teams to safely deploy features, run controlled experiments, and measure impact. The platform includes advanced statistical analysis, targeting capabilities, and integration with the analytics layer for comprehensive experiment measurement.

**Amplitude Session Replay** captures and reconstructs user sessions, providing visual context to complement quantitative analytics data. This enables teams to understand the "why" behind user behaviors observed in analytics.

**Amplitude Guides and Surveys** facilitates in-product user research and engagement through targeted surveys and user feedback collection, creating a closed-loop system for product optimization.

**Data Management Layer** encompasses comprehensive data governance, including tracking plans, data quality monitoring, transformations, and integration capabilities that ensure reliable data collection and processing across all products.

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

**Core Analytics Concepts:**
- **Events**: Discrete user actions or system occurrences (e.g., "Button Clicked", "Page Viewed")
- **Event Properties**: Contextual attributes associated with specific events
- **User Properties**: Persistent attributes of users that remain consistent across sessions
- **Group Properties**: Properties associated with account-level entities (requires Accounts add-on)
- **Cohorts**: Dynamic or static user segments based on behavioral criteria
- **Funnels**: Sequential analysis of user progression through defined steps
- **Retention**: Measurement of user return behavior over time periods

**Experimentation Terminology:**
- **Feature Flags**: Boolean toggles that control feature visibility and behavior
- **Variants**: Different versions of features or experiences being tested
- **Allocation**: Percentage of users exposed to experiments
- **Statistical Significance**: Confidence level in experiment results
- **Lift**: Percentage improvement in key metrics from experiments

**Data Management Terms:**
- **Tracking Plans**: Comprehensive schemas defining expected events and properties
- **Sources**: Data collection endpoints (SDKs, APIs, integrations)
- **Destinations**: External systems receiving Amplitude data
- **Transformations**: Data processing rules applied at query or ingestion time
- **Schema Violations**: Deviations from defined tracking plans

## Chart Types and Analytics Capabilities

- **Lifecycle**: User state transitions and engagement evolution
- **Personas**: Behavioral clustering and user segmentation
- **Compass**: Metric correlation and relationship analysis
- **Impact Analysis**: Statistical analysis of feature impact on key metrics
- **Engagement Matrix**: Multi-dimensional engagement scoring

**Specialized Charts:**
- **Data Tables**: Flexible tabular data exploration
- **Experiment Results**: Dedicated experimentation analysis and statistical testing
- **Legacy Charts**: Deprecated chart types maintained for backward compatibility
