# Amplitude Product Ecosystem

## High-Level Overview

Amplitude is a comprehensive product analytics platform that helps organizations understand user behavior, optimize product experiences, and drive business growth. The platform enables tracking user interactions, analyzing behavioral patterns, running experiments, managing customer data, and visualizing user sessions.

Key features include behavioral analytics with multiple visualization methods, experimentation capabilities, customer data management, session replay for qualitative analysis, cross-platform SDK support, and an extensive API ecosystem for integrations.

Core use cases span product optimization, user journey analysis, feature experimentation, conversion optimization, retention analysis, and revenue impact measurement.

- Privacy controls with configurable masking
- Integration with analytics events

### SDK Ecosystem
Cross-platform coverage including:
- **Browser SDK** - JavaScript library
- **Mobile SDKs** - iOS and Android
- **Cross-Platform SDKs** - React Native, Flutter
- **Game Development SDKs** - Unity, Unreal
- **Server-Side SDKs** - Node.js, Python, Java, Go
- **Ampli** - Type-safe analytics code generation

## Key Nomenclature and Definitions

- **Event** - Discrete user action or system occurrence
- **User** - Individual identified by unique ID
- **Session** - Period of continuous user activity
- **Property** - Metadata attached to events or users
- **Cohort** - Group of users with common characteristics
- **Funnel** - Sequence of events in a conversion path
- **Retention** - Measurement of returning users
- **SDK** - Client libraries for tracking implementation
- **API** - Programmatic access points
- **Experiment** - Controlled test comparing feature variations
- **Feature Flag** - Toggle for enabling/disabling features
- **Session Replay** - Visual recording of user interactions
- **Masking** - Privacy protection hiding sensitive content
- **Data Source** - Origin point for imported data
- **Destination** - Target system for exported data

## Product Ecosystem Integration

Amplitude operates as an integrated ecosystem with a data-driven workflow:

1. **Data Collection** - SDKs and APIs capture behavior across platforms
2. **Data Processing** - Raw data is processed and enriched
3. **Analysis** - Various tools analyze the processed data
4. **Activation** - Insights drive actions through experiments
5. **Optimization** - Results feed back into development

Cross-product workflows include:
- Identifying patterns in Analytics and testing improvements in Experiment
- Using Session Replay to qualitatively understand Analytics findings
- Creating audience segments in CDP and targeting them in Experiment
- Correlating experiment results with long-term behavior in Analytics

The platform supports multi-site architecture with English and Japanese localization, and features data residency controls for compliance.

## API Endpoints and Implementation Examples

### Analytics SDK Implementation
```javascript
// Browser SDK with Session Replay
import * as amplitude from '@amplitude/analytics-browser';
import { sessionReplayPlugin } from '@amplitude/plugin-session-replay-browser';

amplitude.init('API_KEY', {
  plugins: [sessionReplayPlugin({
    sampleRate: 1.0,
    maskAllInputs: true
  })]
});

// Event tracking
amplitude.track('Button Clicked', {
  buttonName: 'Submit',
  pageLocation: 'Signup Form'
});
```

### Experiment Implementation
```javascript
// Web experiment implementation
import { Experiment } from '@amplitude/experiment-js-client';

const experiment = Experiment.initialize({
  apiKey: 'DEPLOYMENT_KEY',
  user: {
    user_id: 'user@example.com'
  }
});

const variant = await experiment.fetch();
const buttonColor = variant.buttonColor?.value || 'blue';
```

### HTTP API Endpoints
RESTful APIs for programmatic access:
- `/api/2/events` - Send events
- `/api/2/usermap` - Map user IDs
- `/api/2/export` - Export raw event data
- `/api/2/behavioralhttps` - Access behavioral cohorts
- `/api/2/taxonomy` - Manage event taxonomy
