This article covers some frequently asked questions about the [Data Table](/docs/analytics/charts/data-tables/data-tables-multi-dimensional-analysis) chart.

## Results

{{partial:collapse name="Why is the sum of the rows in my Data Table greater than the overall value?"}}
After applying a group-by clause to a uniques metric within a Data Table, a single user **may** appear in more than one group **if** they triggered that event multiple times with **different values** for the property specified in the group-by. So the sum of uniques after a group-by can be **greater** than the overall value. 
{{/partial:collapse}}


{{partial:collapse name="The overall value in my Data Table does not equal the sum of the rows below it when it should. Why?"}}
This is due to caching. The overall result and the group-by results are generated by different queries, so they are cached a bit differently. If you update the end day to yesterday in the date picker, the results will be consistent.

{{partial:collapse name="When I apply an attribution model in my Data Table, why doesn’t the overall value equal the sum of the values in the rows below it?"}}
When there's a metric applied with attribution in a Data Table **and** there are more than ten possible values for the group-by clause applied, only ten values will be visible. When this happens, you'll see a[pruning message at the top](/docs/analytics/charts/group-by) of the screen. There are other users who contribute to the total, but these users have values that aren't included in the ten values shown (they've been pruned from view), which is why the sum of the ten rows does not equal the overall value shown at the top.

{{partial:collapse name="Why do some of my values disappear in my Data Table when I sort from high to low?"}}
For details about results limits and sorting logic in Data Tables, see the [Data Tables documentation](/docs/analytics/charts/data-tables/data-tables-multi-dimensional-analysis).
{{/partial:collapse}}


{{partial:collapse name="Why does my Data Table show only 100 rows when I’ve applied a group-by clause?"}}
For details about results limits and sorting logic in Data Tables, see the [Data Tables documentation](/docs/analytics/charts/data-tables/data-tables-multi-dimensional-analysis).
{{/partial:collapse}}


{{partial:collapse name="Why do some of my formula metric column cells populate in my Data Table, while others show up as null (“-”)?"}}
The formula metric within a Data Table works only for groups that have a value for all terms in the formula. If one cell is not available that makes up the formula, the formula will populate as a dash.

## Exports


{{partial:collapse name="Why doesn’t my exported CSV include all the rows displayed in the Data Table?"}}
For details about results limits and sorting logic in Data Tables, see the [Data Tables documentation](/docs/analytics/charts/data-tables/data-tables-multi-dimensional-analysis).
{{/partial:collapse}}


{{partial:collapse name="Why does my exported CSV show more values than what’s shown in the Data Table?"}}
For details about results limits and sorting logic in Data Tables, see the [Data Tables documentation](/docs/analytics/charts/data-tables/data-tables-multi-dimensional-analysis).
{{/partial:collapse}}


{{partial:collapse name="Why does my exported CSV contain more than 10,000 rows if 10,000 rows is the limit?"}}
The limit is 10,000 groups per metric per group-by clause. If you have multiple metrics in your data table, and the groups of the first column are different from those of the second column, the results may display as a union of available properties across the board, which could exceed 10,000 rows overall.
{{/partial:collapse}}

{{partial:collapse name="When I export my Data Table as a PDF or PNG, why is the image in the export cut off"}}
This is due to a bounded box of the Data Table, which is set intentionally due to certain technical requirements.

## Usability


{{partial:collapse name="Why can’t I scroll horizontally within a Data Table?"}}
When you have a lot of group-by filters, these property values can take up the entire width of a laptop screen. This pushes the metric columns off the page, making them unreachable. Try to open the Data Table on a monitor, or reducing the number of group-bys applied.

{{/partial:collapse}}


{{partial:collapse name="Can I edit the column headers within a Data Table?"}}
No. If you'd like to see this changed, submit a feature request via the Amplitude widget at the bottom right corner on the UI.
{{/partial:collapse}}


{{partial:collapse name="Can I show all the filters applied to the Data Table without having to hover over the filter icon?"}}
No. The filter is only visible when hovering over it.

{{/partial:collapse}}


{{partial:collapse name="Is there a way to perform simple calculations using the columns of Data Tables? For example, I have two columns, A and B. How do I calculate `A / B` row-wise and display the result in a third column?"}}
You can create a [formula metric](/docs/analytics/charts/data-tables/data-tables-create-metric) to accomplish this.
