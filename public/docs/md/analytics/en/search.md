Amplitude's Search feature is a handy and simple way to locate charts, dashboard, and cohorts created by other members of your organization.

Amplitude generates search results in real time as you make changes to your search parameters. These results are based on your own recent activity, as well as trending content in your organization.
## Search for charts, dashboards, cohorts, and notebooks

1. In the top navigation bar, click the Search bar.
2. In the *Search* field, enter the word or phrase you'd like to search for and either click the relevant result in the dropdown, or click *Enter* to view a full list of results. If you see the result you want in the results dropdown, click it. Otherwise, continue to step 3.
3. If you want to add a filter to your query, or to apply advanced sorting logic, go to the *Filter* section and set up any filters you'd like to include in this search. Your options include:

      * Limiting your search to **archived** items only
      * Limiting your search to **official content** only
      * Limiting your search to **templates** only
      * The **space** the item belongs to
      * **Type** of item (chart, cohort, dashboard, experiment, flag, or notebook)
      * The **editor**, or creator, of the item
      * The **project** the item belongs to
      * The **last edited date** in which the item was **last edited** (in the last week, last month, last year, or any time)

If a content owner has set an item to be non-discoverable, it doesn't turn up in search results. This restriction doesn't apply to managers or admins.
