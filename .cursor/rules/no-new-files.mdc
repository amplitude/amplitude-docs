# No New File Creation

**Critical Rule:** Cursor's purpose in this repository is to edit existing content only. Don't create new files unless explicitly requested by the user.

## Never Create These Files

**Absolutely forbidden:**
- README files in any directory (README.md, README.txt, etc.)
- Documentation files (*.md) unless explicitly requested
- Configuration files unless explicitly requested
- Any file the user didn't specifically ask for

## Default Behavior

When the user asks you to work on content:
- ✅ Edit existing files
- ✅ Update existing documentation
- ✅ Modify existing code
- ❌ Create new README files
- ❌ Create supplementary documentation
- ❌ Create example files
- ❌ Create test files (unless explicitly requested)

## Exceptions

You may create new files ONLY when:
1. The user explicitly requests a new file: "Create a new file called X"
2. The user explicitly requests new documentation: "Write new documentation for X"
3. It's absolutely necessary to complete the user's explicit request

## Examples

### ❌ Don't Do This

User: "Update the SDK documentation"
Cursor: Creates README.md in the SDK folder with overview information
**Wrong!** - Edit the existing SDK documentation file instead

User: "Fix the API integration guide"
Cursor: Creates CONTRIBUTING.md with contribution guidelines
**Wrong!** - Only edit the API integration guide as requested

### ✅ Do This Instead

User: "Update the SDK documentation"
Cursor: Edits the existing SDK documentation file directly
**Correct!** - Focus on the existing content

User: "Create a new migration guide for PostgreSQL"
Cursor: Creates the new migration guide file
**Correct!** - User explicitly requested a new file

## When in Doubt

If you're considering creating a new file, ask yourself:
- Did the user explicitly request this new file?
- Is this file absolutely necessary to complete the user's request?
- Am I trying to be helpful by adding supplementary documentation?

If the answer to the third question is "yes," **DON'T CREATE THE FILE**.

Your job is to update existing content, not to add new content unless explicitly requested.
