# Use Contractions

Contractions make documentation more conversational and easier to read. Use contractions except at the end of sentences or when emphasis is needed.

## Required Contractions

Use these contractions instead of their expanded forms:

- "don't" instead of "do not".
- "can't" instead of "cannot".
- "isn't" instead of "is not".
- "aren't" instead of "are not".
- "doesn't" instead of "does not".
- "hasn't" instead of "has not".
- "haven't" instead of "have not".
- "wasn't" instead of "was not".
- "weren't" instead of "were not".
- "won't" instead of "will not" (but prefer present tense).
- "shouldn't" instead of "should not".
- "couldn't" instead of "could not".
- "wouldn't" instead of "would not".

## Examples

**Before:**
```
You cannot configure the API until you do not have valid credentials. 
This feature is not available in the free tier.
```

**After:**
```
You can't configure the API until you have valid credentials.
This feature isn't available in the free tier.
```

## Exceptions

- End of sentences where emphasis is needed: "That is important." not "That's important.".
- Technical terms or formal contexts where contraction would be unclear.
