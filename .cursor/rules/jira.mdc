# Jira Ticket Management

For any documentation work in this repository, ensure proper Jira ticket tracking.

## Workflow

1. **Check for existing Jira reference** in the user's prompt:
   - Look for Jira issue keys (format: `DOC-123`, `DOC-456`, etc.)
   - Look for Jira links (format: `https://amplitude.atlassian.net/browse/DOC-123`)
   - If found, proceed with the work—no action needed

2. **If no Jira reference exists**, create a new ticket automatically:
   - Use the `mcp_Atlassian_createJiraIssue` tool
   - Set these parameters:
     - `cloudId`: `"https://amplitude.atlassian.net"`
     - `projectKey`: `"DOC"`
     - `issueTypeName`: `"Task"`
     - `summary`: Create a concise summary based on the user's request (under 100 characters)
     - `description`: Provide more details about the documentation task

3. **After ticket creation**:
   - Display the ticket ID clearly (e.g., "DOC-123")
   - Provide the ticket URL
   - Remind the user: "When creating a git branch for this work, include the ticket ID in the branch name (e.g., `DOC-123-update-sdk-docs`)"

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario A: User provides ticket reference
```
User: "Update the SDK docs for DOC-456"
```
✅ Ticket reference found—proceed with the work

### Scenario B: User provides ticket link
```
User: "Update https://amplitude.atlassian.net/browse/DOC-789"
```
✅ Ticket reference found—proceed with the work

### Scenario C: No ticket reference
```
User: "Update the Android SDK documentation to include new features"
```
❌ No ticket found—create new ticket with summary: "Update Android SDK documentation"

## Notes

- This ensures all documentation work is tracked in Jira
- Helps the Docs team maintain visibility into ongoing work
- Supports proper git workflow with ticket IDs in branch names
