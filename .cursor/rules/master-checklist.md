# Master Documentation Writing Checklist

Apply these rules IN ORDER when editing any documentation:

## 1. ACTIVE VOICE (Most Critical - Do TWO Passes)

### First Pass: Convert Passive to Active
Search for: `is/are/was/were [verb]ed`, `can be`, `will be`, `is assigned`, `are granted`, `is removed`, etc.

**Convert ALL instances:**
- ❌ "Users can be assigned" → ✅ "You can assign users"
- ❌ "is removed from" → ✅ "you remove from"
- ❌ "permissions are granted" → ✅ "grants permissions" or "you grant permissions"

### Second Pass: Verify Zero Passive Voice
Do a final search to ensure no passive constructions remain.

## 2. PRESENT TENSE

Remove all future tense:
- ❌ "will open" → ✅ "opens"
- ❌ "will allow you to" → ✅ "lets you"
- ❌ "will be able to" → ✅ "can"

## 3. CONTRACTIONS

Apply contractions consistently:
- ❌ "cannot" → ✅ "can't"
- ❌ "are not" → ✅ "aren't"
- ❌ "is not" → ✅ "isn't"
- ❌ "does not" → ✅ "doesn't"
- ❌ "it is" → ✅ "it's"
- ❌ "that is" → ✅ "that's"

## 4. CONCISE LANGUAGE

Replace wordy phrases:
- ❌ "in order to" → ✅ "to"
- ❌ "via" → ✅ "through"
- ❌ "desired" → ✅ "want" or "need"
- ❌ "prior to" → ✅ "before"
- Remove: "easily", "simply" (unless critical to meaning)

## 5. SECOND PERSON

- ✅ Use "you" and "your"
- ❌ Avoid "we", "our", "us" (except metadata)
- ❌ "We recommend" → ✅ "Amplitude recommends" or imperative

## 6. DIRECT INSTRUCTIONS

Remove "please" from ALL instructions:
- ❌ "Please navigate to..." → ✅ "Navigate to..."
- ❌ "Please make sure to..." → ✅ "Make sure to..."

## 7. HEADINGS

- Start document content with H2 (##), not H1 (#)
- Use sentence case, not title case
- No ending punctuation (no periods, colons, question marks)

## Quick Pattern Search

Before completing edits, search for these patterns:

```regex
is assigned|are assigned|can be|will be|is created|are created
is removed|are removed|is granted|are granted|cannot|are not
is not|does not|in order to|via|please|we recommend
```

## Final Verification

- [ ] Zero passive voice (TWO passes done)
- [ ] All future tense removed
- [ ] All contractions applied
- [ ] Concise language throughout
- [ ] Second person ("you") used consistently
- [ ] No "please" in instructions
- [ ] Headings properly formatted

**Remember:** Active voice is the #1 issue. Always do two passes specifically for passive voice.
