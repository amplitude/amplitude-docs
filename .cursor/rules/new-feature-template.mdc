# New Feature Documentation Template

You are helping someone document a new feature in Amplitude's product documentation.

## When to Use This Rule

Invoke this rule when someone asks to:
- "Document a new feature"
- "Create docs for [feature name]"
- "Write feature documentation"
- "Document new functionality"

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Information

Ask the person these questions:

1. **Feature name:** What's the feature called?
2. **Product area:** Which product is this for?
   - Analytics (charts, analysis tools)
   - CDP/Audiences (cohorts, syncing, destinations)
   - Data Management (taxonomy, governance, sources)
   - Session Replay
   - Feature Experiment / Web Experiment
   - SDK/API
   - Admin/Account Management
3. **User benefit:** What problem does this solve or what does it enable? (1-2 sentences)
4. **Prerequisites:** What do users need before using this feature?
   - Plan tier requirements (Growth, Enterprise, etc.)
   - Permissions/roles required
   - Prior setup or configuration
   - Integrations needed
5. **Primary use case:** What's the main workflow or task?

### Step 2: Determine the Right Collection

Based on the product area, suggest the appropriate collection:

| Product Area | Collection Folder | Web Route |
|--------------|------------------|-----------|
| Analytics overview | analytics | `/docs/analytics/{slug}` |
| Event Segmentation | event-segmentation | `/docs/analytics/charts/event-segmentation/{slug}` |
| Funnel Analysis | funnel-analysis | `/docs/analytics/charts/funnel-analysis/{slug}` |
| Retention | retention-analysis | `/docs/analytics/charts/retention-analysis/{slug}` |
| Lifecycle | lifecycle | `/docs/analytics/charts/lifecycle/{slug}` |
| Other charts | charts | `/docs/analytics/charts/{slug}` |
| CDP/Audiences | audiences | `/docs/data/audiences/{slug}` |
| Data Management | data | `/docs/data/{slug}` |
| Sources | sources | `/docs/data/sources/{slug}` |
| Destinations | destination-catalog | `/docs/data/destination-catalog/{slug}` |
| Session Replay | session-replay | `/docs/session-replay/{slug}` |
| Feature Experiment | experiment | `/docs/feature-experiment/{slug}` |
| Web Experiment | web_experiment | `/docs/web-experiment/{slug}` |
| Experiment SDKs | experiment-sdks | `/docs/sdks/experiment-sdks/{slug}` |
| Browser SDK | browser_sdk | `/docs/sdks/analytics/browser/{slug}` |
| iOS SDK | ios_sdk | `/docs/sdks/analytics/ios/{slug}` |
| Android SDK | android_sdk | `/docs/sdks/analytics/android/{slug}` |
| Analytics API | api | `/docs/apis/analytics/{slug}` |
| Experiment API | experiment-apis | `/docs/apis/experiment/{slug}` |
| Account Management | account-management | `/docs/admin/account-management/{slug}` |
| Admin | admin | `/docs/admin/{slug}` |

### Step 3: Generate Document Structure

Create a new markdown file with this structure:

```markdown
---
id: [Generate a UUID]
blueprint: [Use appropriate blueprint for the collection]
title: [Feature Name]
source: https://help.amplitude.com/hc/en-us/articles/[if migrating from Help Center]
this_article_will_help_you:
  - '[Benefit 1 - what users will accomplish]'
  - '[Benefit 2]'
landing: false
exclude_from_sitemap: false
updated_by: [Leave for tech writers to fill]
updated_at: [Leave for tech writers to fill]
---

[One-sentence description of what this feature does and why it matters]

## Prerequisites

[What users need before using this feature - if applicable. Remove this section if there are no prerequisites]

- [Prerequisite 1]
- [Prerequisite 2]

## [Primary Task/Use Case Heading - Use imperative verb]

[Brief introduction to the main workflow - 1-2 sentences]

1. Navigate to [location in product].
2. Click [button or option].
3. Configure [specific settings]:
   - **[Setting name]**: [What it does]
   - **[Setting name]**: [What it does]
4. Click **[Action button]**.

[Result description - what happens after completing these steps]

### Example

[If applicable, show a code example, configuration example, or describe a concrete scenario]

## Common use cases

[Optional: If there are multiple distinct ways to use this feature, describe them here]

### [Use case 1]

[Brief description and key steps]

### [Use case 2]

[Brief description and key steps]

## Common questions

### [Question 1 - phrase as user would ask]

[Answer in 2-3 sentences]

### [Question 2]

[Answer in 2-3 sentences]

## Related resources

- [Related doc 1 - use full /docs/ route]
- [Related doc 2 - use full /docs/ route]
- [Related doc 3 - use full /docs/ route]
```

### Step 4: Apply Amplitude Style Rules

Ensure the generated content follows all Amplitude documentation standards:

✅ **Active voice** - No passive constructions
- ❌ "Settings can be configured"
- ✅ "Configure the settings"

✅ **Present tense** - No future tense
- ❌ "The feature will allow you to"
- ✅ "The feature lets you"

✅ **Contractions** - Use conversational tone
- ❌ "cannot", "does not", "is not"
- ✅ "can't", "doesn't", "isn't"

✅ **Second person** - Use "you"
- ❌ "Users should navigate to..."
- ✅ "Navigate to..."

✅ **Direct instructions** - No "please"
- ❌ "Please click the button"
- ✅ "Click the button"

✅ **Concise language** - Remove wordy phrases
- ❌ "in order to", "via", "desired"
- ✅ "to", "through", "want/need"

✅ **Internal links** - Use Statamic routes
- ❌ `[link](../other-doc.md)`
- ✅ `[link](/docs/collection-path/other-doc)`

### Step 5: Suggest Filename and Location

Recommend:
- **Filename:** `[feature-name-in-kebab-case].md`
- **Location:** `content/collections/[collection-name]/en/[filename]`
- **Web URL:** Will be `/docs/[route-path]/[filename-without-md]`

### Step 6: Remind About Next Steps

After generating the document, remind the contributor:

1. **Add images** if applicable (place in `public/docs/output/img/[collection]/`)
2. **Add code examples** if this is SDK or API documentation
3. **Test links** to ensure they work
4. **Submit PR** - Vercel will generate a preview automatically
5. **Tag tech writers** for review (@tech-writers or #amplitude-docs)

## Blueprint Reference

Each collection uses specific blueprints. Common ones:

- `analytic` - For analytics collection
- `lifecycle`, `funnel_analysis`, `event_segmentation`, etc. - For chart collections
- `data` - For data collection
- `audience` - For audiences collection
- `sdk` - For SDK documentation
- `api` - For API documentation
- `experiment` - For experiment features
- `admin` - For admin documentation

Check existing files in the target collection to confirm the correct blueprint.

## Example Interaction

**User:** "Document the new cohort sync feature"

**Your Response:**
"I'll help you document cohort sync. Let me gather some information:

1. Is this for the Audiences product?
2. What destinations can users sync cohorts to?
3. What's the main benefit - real-time marketing activation?
4. Prerequisites - do they need specific integrations set up first?
5. Is there a specific plan tier requirement?

Once you provide these details, I'll generate the documentation in the correct collection with proper structure and style."

## Tips for Quality Documentation

- **Start with "why"** - Explain the value before the steps
- **Use real examples** - Show actual configuration values or scenarios
- **Anticipate questions** - What would confuse users?
- **Cross-link** - Connect to related documentation
- **Show, don't just tell** - Include screenshots or code examples where helpful
- **Test the steps** - Make sure the workflow actually works as described
