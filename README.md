# Amplitude Docs

This repository contains the source files and CMS of [Amplitude's Documentation site](https://amplitude.com/docs)

## Install locally

This site uses the [Statamic](https://statamic.com) CMS. By virtue of being a flat-file by default CMS, Statamic is easy to work with on your local machine, provided you have the correct tooling installed.

This site requires the following:
- GitHub access
- Laravel Herd
- A terminal app
- A code editor (VS Code)

### GitHub

You can use whichever method is more comfortable to interact with the repository, command line or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). Once you have access to the `amplitude/amplitude-docs` repository, clone the repository locally to your machine.

Once cloned, rename the file `.env.example` to `.env`.

### Laravel Herd

Statamic is built on a PHP framework / ecosystem called [Laravel](https://laravel.com). Laravel provides a tool to install and configure your local PHP environment to install and run Statamic. To run Herd (requires macOS):

1. Download [Herd](https://herd.laravel.com/) and install it.
2. In Herd settings, on the **General** tab, add the *parent folder* to `/amplitude-docs`. For example, if the path to your local `amplitude-docs` folder is `/work/amplitude-docs`, add `/work` as a Herd Path.
3. On the **PHP** tab in Herd's settings, install version `8.2`.
4. On the **Node** tab in Herd's settings, install version `20`.
5. Close the Herd settings.

### Set your .env file

Rename the file `.env.example` to `.env`.

### Command line

Developing and building with Statamic requires some time in the terminal. You can use the built in macOS terminal, iTerm2, or Warp for extended functionality.

Install `composer` by running `brew install composer`.

When you have your terminal app of choice ready, navigate to the directory where you cloned the `amplitude-docs` repository.

In that directory, run `composer install`. This reads the application's `composer.json` file and installs any PHP dependencies.

In the same directory, run `npm install` to install npm dependencies.

Run `php please` to validate the installation. If successful, the terminal displays a list of commands that `please` can run.

Run the following to initiate the site's local cache:
- `php artisan cache:clear`
- `php please stache:refresh`

Run the command `php please make:user` to create a local admin user to interact with the Statamic dashboard. On the fourth step, enable Super user status for the user you create.

### View the site

Run `npm run dev` to generate the CSS and JavaScript assets necessary to display the site. If you plan to develop CSS, run `npm run watch` to rebuild the CSS and JS on every save.

With a new Super user created, point your browser to `amplitude-docs.test`. All sites that Herd serves use the `.test` tld by default. You should see site in its current state.

To access the control panel, go to `amplitude-docs.test/cp`. The control panel provides access to the front end editing environment for content, navigations, images, and other parts of the site.

## Working with Docs

> Tip: The easiest way to get to the sourcefile of an article is to use the pencil icon that's enabled on local environments. Look for it near the article title.


### Collections

Adding content to the Amplitude Docs site is different than other site builders or CMS platforms. Instead of using the directory structure or file system to determine the page hierarchy, Statamic sites use Collections. Collections are containers that hold similar content, and have routes defined on them. 

For example, [`account-management`](https://github.com/amplitude/amplitude-docs/tree/main/content/collections/account-management/en) is a collection. The content within that collection all relate to Account Management. Each collection also has a YAML file that sets properties for the whole collection. [Here](https://github.com/amplitude/amplitude-docs/blob/main/content/collections/account-management.yaml) is the YAML file for that Account Management collection. Notice on line 5, there's a a `route` property. Routes set the URL structure for every piece of content within that collection. In this case, the route is set as `/admin/account-management/{slug}` where `{slug}` is a variable for the article's slug.

### Images

The easiest way to add images to your article is to place the `public/docs/output/img/*` folder, and then reference them with `![](/docs/output/img/*)`. Statamic supports adding assets through the dashboard as well, which makes available any metadata you assign to the image, like alt text.
