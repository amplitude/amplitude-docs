{{partial:admonition type="important" heading="Enhanced Schema Validation"}}
This API performs schema validation before executing queries. This enhanced validation ensures that all API requests strictly adhere to the documented schema requirements.

**What this means for you:**
- Requests that previously succeeded despite not meeting schema requirements may return `400 Bad Request` responses
- Error messages provide specific details about validation failures to help you correct your requests
- The schema hasn't changed—only the enforcement of existing requirements

**If you receive validation errors:**
1. Review the error message in the response, which indicates the specific schema requirement that wasn't met
2. Ensure you include and correctly format all required parameters, according to the endpoint documentation
3. Verify that all parameter values match their expected types and constraints

Most users shouldn't experience any issues, as this change only affects requests that don't conform to the documented API schema.
