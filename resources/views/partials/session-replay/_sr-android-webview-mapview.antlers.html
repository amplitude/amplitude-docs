### WebView and MapView support (Beta)

By default, Session Replay blocks web views and map views in a capture. To enable capture of these components, use the settings described in [Block on-screen data](docs/session-replay/session-replay-react-native-standalone-sdk#mask-onscreen-data).

Web view session replay injects JavaScript into the rendered page. To enable this, the SDK sets `javaScriptEnabled` to `true` on the unmasked web view.
