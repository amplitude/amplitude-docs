### Replay length and session length don't match

In some scenarios, the length of a replay may exceed the time between the `[Amplitude] Start Session` and `[Amplitude] End Session` events. This happens when a user closes their browser or browser tab and `[Amplitude] End Session` occurs, but the Browser SDK and Session Replay plugin haven't yet processed it. When the user visits that page again, the SDK and plugin process the event and send it to Amplitude, along with the replay. You can verify this scenario occurs if you see a discrepancy between the `End Session Client Event Time` and the `Client Upload Time`.

Session replays may not appear in Amplitude due to:

- Content security policy
- Blocked JavaScript
- No events triggered through the browser SDK in the current session
- Sampling

#### Local development and focus state

The Session Replay SDK and plugin capture only the page that's in focus. When you develop locally with the browser console open, focus states may not work as expected. If you don't see replays in Amplitude, try to enable `debugMode`. In this mode, Session Replay ignores the focus handle and enables extra debugging information.

```js
const sessionReplayTracking = window.sessionReplay.plugin({
 debugMode: true,  //[tl! ~~]
 sampleRate: 1, 
 });
```

#### Content security policy

When you add the Session Replay script to your site, visit a page on which the Session Replay SDK is running, and open your browser's developer tools.

Check for any error messages in the JavaScript console that contain the text `Content Security Policy`. For example, `Refused to connect to 'https://api-secure.amplitude.com/sessions/track' because it violates the document's Content Security Policy`.

To resolve this error, update your site's content security policy to allow connection to Amplitude's APIs.

#### Blocked JavaScript

Browser extensions or network security policy may block the Session Replay SDK. Check your browser's developer tools to see if requests fail, and if so, add an exception for the blocked domains.

#### No events triggered through the browser SDK in the current session

Session Replay requires that at least one event in the user's session has the `[Amplitude] Session Replay ID` property. The [Browser SDK](/docs/sdks/analytics/browser/browser-sdk-2) `Session Start` and `Session End` events include this property by default. If you instrument your events with any SDK other than the Amplitude Browser SDK 2, use the [Session Replay Standalone SDK](/docs/session-replay/session-replay-standalone-sdk) and ensure you tag your events with the necessary event properties.

For local testing, you can force a Session Start event to ensure that Session Replay functions. 

1. Open your browser's developer tools, and delete any cookie that begins with `AMP_`.
2. Close developer tools and refresh the page.
3. In Amplitude, in the User Lookup Event Stream, you should see a Session Start event that includes the `[Amplitude] Session Replay ID` property. After processing, the Play Session button should appear for that session.

#### Sampling

As mentioned above, the default `sampleRate` for Session Replay is `0`. Update the rate to a higher number. For more information see, [Sampling rate](#sampling-rate).

#### Some sessions don't include the Session Replay ID property"Link to this section"

Session replay doesn't require that all events in a session have the `[Amplitude] Session Replay ID` property, only that one event in the session has it. Reasons why `[Amplitude] Session Replay ID` may not be present in an event include:

- If you instrument an event with a source different from the source you connect to Session Replay. For example, your application may send events from a backend source, rather than the Browser SDK.
- If events fire when the user isn't focused on the page. Session Replay pauses the SDK when user focus leaves the page. Amplitude events may still send through your provider, but `getSessionReplayProperties()` doesn't return the `[Amplitude] Session Replay ID` property. This is because Session Replay hasn't begun the capture, since the user hasn't interacted with the page. This should lead to a decrease in the amount of inactivity that a replay captures.
