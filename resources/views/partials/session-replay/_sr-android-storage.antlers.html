## Session Replay storage

If a user opts out tracking in your app, use the `optOut` configuration option to disable replay collection for that user.

(alpha) Session Replay stores data in memory only.

- This can lead to data loss between app starts. Make sure to call `flush()` before app exit.
- Memory usage grows until you call `flush()` to transfer the session replay data to the server.
- Session data isn't retried on failure to transfer to the Amplitude servers.
