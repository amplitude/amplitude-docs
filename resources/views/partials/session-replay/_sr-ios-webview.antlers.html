### Web view support (Beta)

By default, Session Replay blocks web views in a capture. To enable capture of all WebView components, set `captureWebViews` to `true` in the Session Replay configuration.

To mask specific WebView components, use the privacy methods described in [Block on-screen data](#block-on-screen-data).
```swift
// UIKit
webView.amp_isBlocked = false
```
