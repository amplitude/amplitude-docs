{{markdown}}
Amplitude built Session Replay to minimize impact on the performance of the iOS apps in which it's installed by:

- Asynchronously processing replay data, to avoid blocking the main user interface thread. The main thread must be used to interact with the view hierarchy, but all processing is performed on a background queue.
- Using batching and lightweight compression to reduce the number of network connections and bandwidth.
- Optimizing view hierarchy processing. Contact Amplitude if you experience issues with hierarchy processing.
