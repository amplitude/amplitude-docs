#### This article will help you:

* Compare active cohorts in your analyses
* Manage your cohorts with archiving, deleting, or transfering ownership
* Learn how to sync, export, or refresh your cohorts

## Compare your cohorts

The Cohort Comparison feature automatically compares your new [cohort](/analytics/behavioral-cohorts) to all active users for the last 30 days. You can then choose a pre-existing cohort to compare it with, look at the overlap between two cohorts, choose user properties for side-by-side composition, compare actives, retention, average events, and more.

In the [Behavioral Cohorts](/analytics/behavioral-cohorts) tab, click the title of a cohort to open the comparison analysis. 

## Manage your cohorts

You can mark cohorts you own as **discoverable** or **unlisted**. Discoverable cohorts can be found by any other user in your organization. Unlisted cohorts are only available to you, admins, managers, and people with a direct link to the cohort. Discoverable cohorts have a green globe icon while unlisted cohorts have a grayed-out toggle.

### Archive a cohort

You can archive a cohort by clicking *More —> Archive*. If you accidentally archive the wrong cohort, click *More* to get the *Unarchive* option.

### Delete a cohort

Only the owner of a cohort can archive and delete a cohort.

To delete a cohort, you will have to archive it first. Once you have archived the cohort, you must confirm the cohort is to be permanently deleted before Amplitude will remove it 

### Transfer ownership of a cohort

You can transfer ownership of cohorts you own to others in your organization. Alternatively, you can also add additional owners of a cohort. Admins and managers can transfer ownership of other people's cohorts, as well as add additional owners to a cohort.
