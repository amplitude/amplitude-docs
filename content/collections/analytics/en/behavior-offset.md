ai_summary: "With Amplitude's behavioral cohorts, you can group users based on behavior patterns. The behavior offset feature lets you further segment users based on behaviors exhibited in different time periods. This enables you to identify specific user groups for various purposes like customer satisfaction, re-engagement campaigns, and churn prevention. Behavior offsets are available on Growth and Enterprise plans. Before using them, familiarize yourself with behavioral cohorts and rolling windows. By adding a behavior offset to an in-line cohort, you can analyze user behaviors across different time frames, helping you make informed decisions to enhance user engagement and retention."

With Amplitude's [behavioral cohorts](/docs/analytics/behavioral-cohorts), you can create groups of users who share a pattern of behavior. The **behavior offset** feature gives you the power to further segment these users based on behaviors they've displayed in two distinct time periods.

Common use cases for behavior offsets include:

* Identifying users who made at least one purchase during the past week who have **also** made at least two more purchases over the preceding 90 days. This is a good proxy for customer satisfaction.
* Measuring users who installed the app but **didn't** make a purchase during the 45 days after install. This information can help you target re-engagement campaigns and convince these new users to convert into paying customers.
* For media companies, behavior offsets can identify users who purchase a subscription but don’t read an article in the following two weeks. This can help identify users who haven’t built a habit of reading content and target them in churn prevention efforts.
* Identifying users who read one article in a given week and then read two or more articles the following week can help you target engaged readers for subscription offers.

In each of these use cases, there are two cohorts in play, separated from each other by the passage of time. In the second example, they are:

* Users who installed the app, and
* Users who didn't make a purchase in the subsequent 45 days

Behavior offsets make it easy to segment the users who appear in both of these cohorts.

### Feature availability

This feature is available to users on **Growth** and **Enterprise plans** only.

## Before you begin

Before getting started, you should read up on [behavioral cohorts](/docs/analytics/behavioral-cohorts) and [rolling windows](/docs/analytics/charts/event-segmentation/event-segmentation-interpret-2) until you're comfortable with both concepts.

## Add a behavior offset to an in-line cohort

This section follows the first example in the bulleted list above: segmenting for users who made at least one purchase in the current period, but also made two or more purchases in the last 90 days. 

To add this behavior offset, follow these steps:

1. In the Segmentation Module, click *+ Performed* to begin creating a new [in-line cohort](/docs/analytics/behavioral-cohorts).
2. Define the **previous period event**. In this example, the previous period event is `Complete Purchase`.
3. Adjust the operator and event frequency, if necessary.
4. From the *More Options* menu for this event, click *Add rolling*.

In the *rolling over* field, enter the number of days you want to allow for the current period event to occur. In this example scenario, that value is 90.

You can change the default durations from per day to weekly, hourly, monthly, or quarterly by changing the setting in the Metrics Module's date picker.

Also, when using a *during* cohort (as opposed to *in each*; [see this article on in-line cohorts in Amplitude for a more detailed explanation](/docs/analytics/behavioral-cohorts)), the *offset* function allows you to create daily offsets, regardless of the interval you set in the date picker.  

![behavioral_offset_duration_dropdown.png](/docs/output/img/analytics/behavioral_offset_duration_dropdown.png)

5. From the same menu as in step 4, click *Add offset*. In the *offset* field, enter the number of days after the occurrence of the previous period event that you want to wait before the rolling window (see step 4 above) begins. 

   In this example, the day of the previous period event doesn't belong in the rolling window, so enter 1. If you want to include that day in your analysis, don't include an offset.
6. Click *+ Performed* again. From the *and who performed* drop-down, select the **current period event**. Continuing with the example, this is `Complete Purchase`.

Your in-line cohort—in which you’re segmenting for users who completed one or more purchases in the current period, and completed two or more purchases in the previous period (90 days, in this case)—should now look like this:

![in-line cohort segment.png](/docs/output/img/analytics/in-line-cohort-segment.png)

By applying the rolling window and offset to the previous period event, you've essentially shifted this cohort to a time in the past. This process offsets **only** the in-line cohort, and **not** the event selected in the Event Module. 

{{partial:admonition type='note'}}
In-line offset for *in each* cohorts is available on **Event Segmentation** charts. In-line offset for *during* cohorts is available on **all chart types except** Compass. When using a *during* cohort, you must define your date range in days.
