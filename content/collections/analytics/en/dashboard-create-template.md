You can easily turn your dashboards into templates, which allow teams to efficiently and confidently recreate their common analyses and share best practices with just a few clicks. Save time when repeating common analyses and make it simpler for new team members to measure impact.

To designate a dashboard as a template, follow these steps:

1. In your dashboard, click *More* and select *Tag as Template* from the dropdown menu.
2. In the *Templatize Dashboard* modal, set the discoverability toggle to on or off, depending on your preferences, and add any instructions you’d like to communicate to users of the template. If you choose not to add your own instructions, Amplitude uses the default boilerplate. Then click *Save*.

Here's what you can expect to see once you've templatized your dashboard:

* The dashboard carries a template icon;
* The dashboard includes the template instructions you added in Step 2 above;
* There's a *Save As New Dashboard* button, which is how you can create copies of the dashboard from the template:

You can find templates using Search or Spaces. Just look for the template icon. You can also filter for dashboard templates in Search, using the Template filter under *Tags*.

## Template use cases

Some common use cases for templates in Amplitude include:

* **A/B testing:** Swap out user or event properties or cohorts with each new experiment’s variants
* **Releases:** Swap out version, campaign, region, etc. to track performance or key metrics for new releases
* **Usage or engagement dashboards:** Segment by feature/product, region, device, customer, channels, etc. to analyze metrics like engagement with critical events, or specific noteworthy funnels
* **B2B or partner use-cases:** Create different dashboards segmented by customer account or partner
* **Amplitude new user onboarding:** Templates for the above use cases to help onboard new Amplitude users by acclimating them to the types of analyses most often performed by their new teams.
