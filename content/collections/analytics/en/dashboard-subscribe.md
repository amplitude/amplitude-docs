When you subscribe to a dashboard, you'll receive an HTML-formatted email report with optional .CSV files. Dashboard subscription emails can be sent to anyone, including people who are not members of your Amplitude organization. 

### Feature availability

This feature is available to users on **all Amplitude plans**. See our [pricing page](https://amplitude.com/pricing) for more details.

To subscribe to a dashboard—either your own, or someone else's—follow these steps: 

1. From within the dashboard you want to subscribe to, click *More,* then select *Subscribe* from the drop-down menu. The *Subscribe to Dashboard Reports* modal will open.
2. In the *Email* tab, your name should already appear in the *Subscribe yourself* field. Set your preferred update frequency and click *Add*.

If you own or co-own the dashboard, you can also add other subscribers, the *Subscribe yourself* field will be named *Add subscribers*; there, you can add subscribers other than yourself.

3. To subscribe a Slack channel to the dashboard, click the *Slack* tab. In the *Add new subscriber(s)* field, enter the names of the Slack channels you want to subscribe to this dashboard. Notifications take the form of automated recurring dashboard PDFs, paired with a link back to the dashboard, sent to Slack channels you designate.

Dashboard owners can add subscribers to a dashboard and set the update frequency (e.g., every Monday at 12pm UTC), with or without an attached .CSV file. Dashboard owners can also customize the frequency of email reports on a person-by-person basis.

View and manage the dashboards you are subscribed to by clicking *Settings > Organization Settings >* *Content Access > Dashboard Subscriptions*. You can cancel subscriptions you no longer need or use, change the day of the week and time the email is sent, and specify whether the email should include a .CSV file. 

Admins can view and delete any dashboard subscriptions in their organization.
