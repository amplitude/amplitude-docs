When you subscribe to a dashboard, you receive an HTML-formatted email report with optional .CSV files. Amplitude can send dashboard subscription emails to anyone, including people who aren't members of your Amplitude organization. 


To subscribe to a dashboard—either your own, or someone else's—follow these steps: 

1. From within the dashboard you want to subscribe to, click *Subscribe*. The *Subscribe to Dashboard Reports* modal opens.
2. In the *Email* tab, your name appears in the *Subscribe yourself* or *Add new subscribers* field. Set your preferred update frequency and click *Add*. For optimal performance, emailed dashboards contain images of the first eight charts on the dashboard. To view all charts, recipients can click through to the full dashboard.

  If you own or co-own the dashboard, you can add other subscribers, the *Subscribe yourself* field appears as *Add subscribers*; there, you can add subscribers other than yourself.

1. To subscribe a Slack channel to the dashboard, click the *Slack* tab. In the *Add new subscriber(s)* field, enter the names of the Slack channels you want to subscribe to this dashboard. Notifications take the form of automated recurring dashboard PDFs, paired with a link back to the dashboard, sent to Slack channels you designate.

Dashboard owners can add subscribers to a dashboard and set the update frequency (for example, every Monday at 12 PM UTC), with or without an attached .CSV file. Dashboard owners can also customize the frequency of email reports on a person-by-person basis.

Navigate to *Settings > Organization Settings >* *Content Access > Dashboard Subscriptions* to view and manage your dashboards.

Admins can view and delete any dashboard subscriptions in their organization.
