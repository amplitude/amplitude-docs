Your workspace allows you to find your Amplitude analyses quickly and reliably, so you can get back to work. This page is only visible to you and includes content you have saved, as well as content you were working on but is still in draft mode.

To find your workspace, navigate to *Spaces > Personal Space*.

Open an item in your workspace by clicking it.

You can find specific types of content by using the *Filter* drop-down.
