Once you've got your dashboard built out the way you want it, you'll need a way to share it with others in your organization.

## Directly share a dashboard

To copy the URL of your dashboard to the clipboard, click the link icon next to *Share*. Then paste it into an email or Slack message.

Alternatively, to share the dashboard directly, follow these steps:

1. Click *Share* instead. In the *Share* tab of the modal that appears, type in the names or emails of everyone you want to share the dashboard with.
2. In the right-side drop-down, set the permissions for everyone you'll be sharing the dashboard with. To make them co-owners, select *Can edit*. To limit their permissions to read-only, select *Can view*.
      
	Adding co-owners to individual charts is a one-by-one process. There is no way to bulk-add a new co-owner to multiple charts at once.
    
3. To create a live, public link that's usable by others without an Amplitude account, click Manage Public Links. For more information, see the article on [public links in Amplitude](/docs/analytics/share-external).

	Public links are only available to customers on a Scholarship, Growth, or Enterprise plan.
    
6. Click _Save_.

## Embed a dashboard

To embed a dashboard in a document, Slack message, or elsewhere, follow these steps:

1. Click *Share*.
2. In the *Embed* tab of the modal that appears, toggle the public embed switch to On.
3. Click *Copy Embed Code* to copy the code to your clipboard. You can now paste the embed code elsewhere.

## Remove co-owners from your dashboard

While a dashboard must have at least one owner, it can also have many co-owners. You grant co-ownership status to other users via the Share feature, discussed above.

To remove co-owners from your dashboard, click _Share_ and find the user you'd like to remove. Click Can edit and change the drop down to Remove. The change will automatically be saved.

Admins can modify ownership of dashboards that do not belong to them.
