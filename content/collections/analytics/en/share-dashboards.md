Once you've got your dashboard built out the way you want it, you'll need a way to share it with others in your organization.

## Directly share a dashboard

To copy the URL of your dashboard to the clipboard, click the link icon next to *Share*. Then paste it into an email or Slack message.

To share the dashboard directly, follow these steps:

1. Click *Share*. In the *Share* tab of the modal that appears, enter the names or email addresses of everyone you want to share the dashboard with.
2. In the right-side drop-down, set the permissions for everyone you're sharing the dashboard with. To make them co-owners, select *Can edit*. To limit their permissions to read-only, select *Can view*.
      
	Adding co-owners to individual charts is a one-by-one process. There is no way to bulk-add a new co-owner to multiple charts at once.
    
3. To create a live, public link that's usable by others without an Amplitude account, click Manage Public Links. For more information, see the article on [public links in Amplitude](/docs/analytics/share-external).

	Public links are only available to customers on a Scholarship, Growth, or Enterprise plan.
    
6. Click _Save_.

## Embed a dashboard

To embed a dashboard in a document, Slack message, or elsewhere, follow these steps:

1. Click *Share*.
2. In the *Embed* tab of the modal that appears, toggle the public embed switch to On.
3. Click *Copy Embed Code* to copy the code to your clipboard. You can now paste the embed code elsewhere.

## Remove co-owners from your dashboard

While a dashboard must have at least one owner, it can also have many co-owners. You grant co-ownership status to other users via the Share feature, discussed above.

To remove co-owners from your dashboard, click _Share_ and find the user you'd like to remove. Click Can edit and change the drop down to Remove. The change will automatically be saved.
