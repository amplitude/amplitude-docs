## Analyze industry-standard metrics
Out-of-the-box Web Analytics offers four sets of insights with default metrics, as well as optional goals or key outcomes, that you are driving users to:

- **Traffic by Channel**: Provides an overview of users visiting your product by channel. Metrics include visitors, bounce rate, session totals, average session duration, sessions per user, and web analytics views.
- **Traffic by Campaign**: Provides an overview of the users visiting your product by campaign. Metrics include visitors, bounce rate, session totals, average session duration, sessions per user, and any defined goals.
- **Page Engagement**: Details user engagement by page. Metrics include visitors, page views, bounce rate, page views per session, entry rate, exit rate, and any defined goals.
- **Conversion**: Provides over-time and aggregated analyses of user conversion based on your defined funnel. Metrics include overall conversion and step-by-step conversion.

Each insight displays a time series chart and an aggregated data table below it.

Follow these steps to analyze metrics in Out-of-the-box Web Analytics:

1. Click *Web Analytics* in the left-hand sidebar and select the insight you’d like to view.
2. If desired, click *Add segment > Amplitude segments* to filter your analysis by user type:
    * **All users**: Users who triggered any event during the selected date range.
    * **Active users**: Users who triggered at least one active event during the selected date range.
    * **New users**: Users who triggered at least one new user event during the selected date range.
    * **Mobile web**: Users who triggered events on a web platform from an Apple iPad, Apple iPhone, or Android device.
    * **Desktop web**: Users who triggered events on a web platform from a Mac or Windows device.

From there, use the data table to further your analysis: 
- Click *Open in Data Table* to view your results in a separate chart.
- For traffic by channel or conversion insights, select the channel you'd like to analyze from the Default Channels dropdown.

For conversion insights, you can also:
- View the data table fields by channel or campaign.
- Display total conversions or conversion rate.

## Modify settings and create goals

Out-of-the-box Web Analytics uses default events and properties from the Browser SDK, but admins or managers can modify them in settings.

Follow these steps to manage settings, create goals, or customize tracked events:

1. Click *Customize*.
2. Select the type of setting you’d like to modify:
   * If *Page View and Filter*, choose the event and property that you’d like to use. This will affect all page-related metrics.
   * For *Breakdown*, choose the default channels you want to display, as well as your campaign and page engagement properties.
   * Set *Conversion Funnel* settings by choosing the events that make up your funnel.

If *Goals*, choose the key events or metrics you'd like to set up as additional metrics. Break down goals by  channels, campaigns, or pages.

## Create a web experiment for specific URLs

On the Page Engagement tab of Web Analytics, when you breakdown your data by Page URL, you can create a [web experiment](/docs/web-experiment) from the table.

Click the flask icon in the Action column of the table, and the New Web Experiment dialog appears pre-populated with the targeted page URL.
