ai_summary: "Amplitude's user profiles feature allows you to search for specific users by ID, device ID, or user property values. You can view a user's details and history, including their event stream, in a centralized and intuitive way. The user history panel provides tabs for Activity, Insights, Session Replays, Cohorts, Experiments, and Flags. You can customize the display of user details, chart a user's event stream, and access raw data fields. The feature also supports portfolios, allowing you to view user event streams across different projects."

Amplitude's **user profiles** gives you a centralized and intuitive way to dive deeper into data generated by users in your product. Switch between different projects and portfolios, search for specific or generic lists, and monitor individual event streams.

## Search for specific users

Find users by ID, device ID, or build conditions to find users based on the events they perform.

To search for a specific user:

1. In Amplitude, navigate to *Users > User Profiles*.
2. In the search box above the active user list, enter the user ID or device ID, or click *Advanced Search* to search by user property values.

Searching by user property values displays a list of users who match the criteria you specified, **and** who triggered at least one active event in the last six months.

When you find the user you're looking for, click their ID to view their user profile. The profile has two sections: the **user details** section—where the user's most-recent properties are visible—and the **user history** section, which contains the user's entire event history and displays all events received from them for a given day, which you can specify using the date picker.

## User details

User details displays properties that describe the user, and allows you to customize the default list of properties in the display. Pin properties to display them by default, or unpin them to move them "below the fold". Use the embedded search to find specific properties or values more easily.

## User history

The user history panel has 6 tabs, Activity, Insights, Session Replays, Cohorts, Experiments, and Flags.

### Activity

The event stream displays a list of all the events the user performed in your application. Filter the list by event type or a specific device ID. Enable *Live event updates* for a real time feed of the user's activity in your application.

Amplitude groups the event stream by **session**, and orders it in **reverse chronological order**, placing the session property with the most recent activity at the top of the list. Blue events in a session are all connected by a line; green, out-of-session events stand alone. Customize the events you want to see in the event stream by choosing to show all events, highlight specific events, or only show specific events. You can also filter on a particular device ID.

There are two available views: the **Info** view, which gives a digestible view of the event data, and the **Raw** view, which displays the raw JSON file Amplitude received, along with any user properties that persisted from previous events or Identify requests. This is useful for debugging the data your product sends to Amplitude.

Group properties are only visible in the raw event view.

#### Chart a user's event stream

You can choose up to ten events from a user's event stream to view in a funnel or segmentation chart. Follow these steps from the user's event stream in User Look-Up:

1. Check the boxes next to the events you'd like to visualize in a chart.
2. Click *Create Chart* and choose *Segmentation* or *Funnel* to visualize the user's event stream data.

{{partial:admonition type="note" heading=""}}
Event names with a *sparkle* icon indicate that Amplitude has generated a name to provide more context around the action a user is taking. These are Autocapture events ingested as `Page Viewed`, `Element Clicked`, and `Element Changed`, but Amplitude uses property information to make them more valuable in the event stream. Click any of them to see their ingested name and properties.

#### Raw data fields

Amplitude uses different timestamps to ensure it reports your data accurately:

* `client_event_time`: Local timestamp (UTC) when the device logged the event.
* `client_upload_time`: Local timestamp (UTC) when the device uploaded the event.
* `server_received_time`: Amplitude timestamp (UTC) when Amplitude's servers receive the event. Amplitude defaults to `server_received_time` if the event doesn't contain a `client_upload_time`.
* `server_upload_time`: Amplitude timestamp (UTC) when the event is ingested into Amplitude's ingestion system. This timestamp isn't used to calculate `event_time`, but it's available to reference in the raw data.
* `event_time`: Amplitude timestamp (UTC) which is the `client_event_time` adjusted by the difference between `server_received_time` and `client_upload_time`, specifically:

```
event_time = client_event_time + (server_received_time - client_upload_time)
```

{{partial:admonition type="note" heading=""}}
If the difference between `server_received_time` and `client_upload_time` is less than 60 seconds, the `event_time` isn't adjusted and is set equal to the `client_event_time`. But if that difference is greater than 60 seconds, Amplitude assumes the `client_event_time` is off, probably because of a wrong system clock, and makes the update.

This occurs automatically for projects with a [project ID](/docs/admin/account-management/manage-orgs-projects#view-and-edit-your-project-information) of 243704 or higher. To apply this 60-second cutoff time to an older project, contact Amplitude Support.

[See this blog post for more detail](https://amplitude.com/blog/dont-trust-client-data).
{{/partial:admonition}}

Daily exported files use `server_upload_time` and all dashboards use `event_time`. Queries on raw data should use `event_time`.

### Insights

The *Insights* tab provides a series of customizable charts to help visualize the user's activity in your application. Click a chart title to open the chart and customize it. Click a replay to open it in a new tab.

### Session replays

The *Session Replays* tab shows a list of all [replays](/docs/session-replay) captured for the selected user. Set the date range, and filter by event, event property, cohort, or session duration.

### Cohorts

The *Cohorts* tab enables you to check if the user is in any of your project's cohorts. To check if the user is in a cohort:

1. Navigate to the *Cohorts* tab.
2. Use the selector to choose one or more cohorts.
3. Click *Check*.

### Experiments

The Experiments tab shows any [feature experiments](/docs/feature-experiment) or [web experiments](/docs/web-experiment) of which the user is a part.

### Flags

The *Flags* tab lists the [feature flags](/docs/feature-experiment/workflow/feature-flag-rollouts) enabled for this specific user.

## Portfolios

User event streams are supported in both projects and portfolios. To find a user stream in a portfolio, navigate to the User & Account Look-Up tab and select the portfolio from the dropdown.

{{partial:admonition type="note" heading="Portfolio project limits"}}
Portfolios support up to five projects. If your use case requires more, contact your account team to unlock up to 10 projects in a portfolio.
{{/partial:admonition}}

User properties are viewable at a project (not portfolio) level. This is because properties may be different for the same user in different projects.
