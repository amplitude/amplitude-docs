If your company uses Amplitude's EU data center, there is a different Slack app intended specifically for EU customers. Find it in the Slack app directory under “[Amplitude - EU](https://amplitude.slack.com/apps/A042J2XCRS9-amplitude-eu).”  Install it by clicking [this link](https://links.amplitude.com/ZFSte8rMWtuwkP5jE/l/0POygAjvJypciVq4d?messageId=6nK7UeyixFZbdLPAQ&rn=&re=gIt92YuUGZ1RXasBXbhB0cul2akVnauYmZlpmI&sc=false), or by following the instructions below.

You will immediately receive a Slack message from Amplitude, which includes a link to a brief explanation of how to use the integration.

After you authenticate, Slack unfurls any links to Amplitude charts, both in Slack channels and direct messages.

Slack will not unfurl Pathfinder, Compass, and Persona charts.

### Connect an Amplitude Data project to Slack

You can also subscribe a Slack channel to real-time notifications of all branch changes or publishing updates occurring within an Amplitude Data project’s tracking plan. These include:

* Branch Created / Deleted / Merged / Approved
* Version Published

To receive these notifications, set up the Amplitude app for Slack for the Amplitude Data project you want to receive updates from.

##### Configure notifications

1. In Amplitude, navigate to *Data > Catalog > Integrations*.
2. If you haven’t previously enabled the Amplitude Slack App, grant Amplitude permission to your Slack workspace. Specify the channel you want Amplitude to send notifications to.

3. Click *Add* to complete the process.

### Turn on link previews

If a shareable link doesn't unfurl when you post it in Slack, you may need to enable link previews in your Slack settings. To do this, review [Slack's documentation](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204399343-Sharing-links-in-Slack).

## Receive Amplitude comments directly in Slack

After you connect your Slack account, Amplitude sends notifications when:

- Someone `@` messages you in an Amplitude comment.
- Someone leaves a comment on content you own.

Use this integration get questions answered about your analysis, share an insight, or leave notes to yourself.

Use the content link within the Slack message to access the Amplitude chart, dashboard, or notebook referenced.

## Connect with team spaces

Connect Amplitude team spaces to specific Slack channels to receive notifications when your team creates new analyses. When someone adds new content to that team space, it appears in the Slack channel. Click *Connect with Slack* from within a team space to set this up:

To disconnect your team space from Slack, click the same button which should now read *Connected to [YourTeamSpaceName]* and select *Disconnect Slack.*
