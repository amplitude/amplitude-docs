## Query examples

### Basic analytics queries

> What were the daily active users over the last 7 days?

> Show signup conversion rates by traffic source this month.

> Which features have the highest engagement rates?

### Experiment analysis

> What's the performance of the checkout experiment?

> Show the statistical significance of the new onboarding flow.

> Which experiment variants are running?

### Content discovery

> Find all charts related to user retention.

> Search for dashboards containing mobile app metrics.

> Show experiments testing the payment flow.

### Advanced analysis

> Compare user behavior between iOS and Android platforms.

> What's the typical user journey for power users?

> Analyze feature adoption rates after the recent product launch.

## Typical analysis workflow

Most analysis questions follow this pattern:

1. **Search**: Find relevant content (charts, dashboards, experiments)  
2. **Retrieve**: Get full definitions and metadata  
3. **Query**: Execute data queries and analysis  
4. **Analyze**: Ask follow-up questions and dive deeper

Example conversation flow:

> User: Show me user retention data.
> AI: [Searches for retention-related charts]  
> AI: [Retrieves chart definitions]  
> AI: [Queries the data and presents results]
> User: Can you break this down by user segment?
> AI: [Modifies query to include segmentation]

## Security and compliance

### Data access

* The MCP server uses your existing Amplitude user permissions and access controls.
* You can only access Amplitude projects and data that you already have permission to view in your regular Amplitude account.
* You receive no additional data access beyond your current Amplitude account privileges  
* OAuth authentication ensures secure connection between the MCP server and your Amplitude account.

### Privacy considerations

The AI service you're using (for example, Claude or Gemini) processes your Amplitude data. Review your organization's policies regarding AI-powered data analysis tools and consider compliance requirements (General Data Protection Regulation, California Consumer Privacy Act).

Third parties (for example, Anthropic) develop and maintain the AI models used with this MCP server. Amplitude isn't responsible for model outputs, including hallucinations, inaccuracies, or errors resulting from model behavior, even if such outputs use your Amplitude data.


### Admin controls

MCP server access is **enabled by default** for all users in your organization. Organization administrators can opt out or restrict access if needed:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Content Access > MCP** in your Amplitude organization settings.
2. Use the content access controls to allow or block the Amplitude MCP server.
3. Access restrictions apply to all MCP clients across all users in your organization.

{{partial:admonition type="note"}}
MCP access controls are an admin-only setting. Individual users can't override organization-level MCP restrictions.
{{/partial:admonition}}

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues

**Authentication and OAuth Issues**

* Ensure your Amplitude account has proper project access.
* Check that you have logged into the correct Amplitude account.
* Make sure you're only logged into one Amplitude organization during the OAuth flow. Logging into multiple organizations can cause authentication issues.
* Try disconnecting the MCP connection and re-authenticating through the OAuth flow.
* Try logging out of Amplitude, then reconnecting.
* Desktop apps may require restart after configuration changes.
* Authorization page may appear to spin indefinitely (close tab after authentication).  

**Missing Data**

* Verify you have access to the specific Amplitude project.  
* Check if the data exists in your Amplitude interface.  
* Ensure proper permissions for the requested data.

**Chart Query Issues**

* AI platforms may truncate some large charts.  
* Querying charts from dashboards may use default chart settings instead of saved dashboard filters.

**MCP Client Issues**

* **Cursor tool call failures**: If MCP tool calls fail in Cursor, this is often due to expired or corrupted authentication tokens. Open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac, `Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux), type and select "Clear All MCP Tokens," then re-authenticate with your accounts.
* **Token limit errors**: If you receive token limit exceeded errors, try starting a new conversation thread or increase the maximum token limit in your MCP client settings.
* **Connection timeouts**: If queries are timing out, try breaking down complex requests into smaller, more focused questions.
* **Tool loading failures**: If tools aren't loading, restart your MCP client application and re-authenticate.
* **Registry not available**: If you can't find the Amplitude listing in your client's registry browser, update your client to the latest version or use the manual setup instructions in the tabs above.

### Getting help

If you encounter issues not covered here:

1. Verify your setup matches the configuration examples.  
2. Test with a simple query like "What Amplitude projects are accessible?"
3. Check that your Amplitude account has the necessary permissions.  
4. Contact your Amplitude administrator for organization-specific setup help.
