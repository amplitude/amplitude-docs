Admins and managers can customize the Home page layout for Amplitude users on a per-project basis. This will allow project managers and project admins to more effectively distribute important insights to their team members, and to ensure newly-invited teammates receive the most relevant and important charts once they join.

## Customize the Home page experience for a team

You must be an admin or a manager of a project to customize the Home page experience.

1. Open the project and look for a blue bar across the top. Alternatively, navigate to *Organization Settings > Project*, and find it there.

2. Click *Set Custom Homepage*. An edit screen will open; here, you can remove any of the default charts, add your own custom charts, and organize them how you see fit.
3. Click *Save changes* to finalize the custom Home page layout. All users in this project who did not already **explicitly customize their personal homepage** will see this new layout as the default, including all new users.
4. To return to the original layout, click the reset button in the top right:

Personal customization of a userâ€™s Home page always takes precedence over any admin- or manager-enabled defaults.
