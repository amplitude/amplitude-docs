Sometimes, you may need to share your Amplitude analyses with people who aren't in your organization, or who shouldn't have full access to your data. You can create **public links** to charts, dashboards, and notebooks and send them to **any** person, even if they're not registered under your Amplitude organization.

### Feature availability

This feature is available to users on **Growth** and **Enterprise plans** only.

## Before you begin

* Remember, anyone can view a public link until you revoke it. On the Enterprise plan, anyone with the password can access your links before their expiration.
* After you revoke a link, you can't to re-enable it. Amplitude redirects users who click a revoked link to a 404 page.
* If you share a public link to a notebook or a dashboard that contains a [Journeys](/docs/analytics/charts/journeys/journeys-understand-paths) chart, that chart isn't visible to the recipient of that link. Use the direct link to the journey chart to share it.
* Amplitude caches charts for 10 minutes.
* Experiment results charts don't support access by public link.

## Creating a public link

##### To create a public link to a chart, dashboard, or notebook

1. Click *Share*, in the top right corner of the menu bar.
2. In the modal that appears, click **Public Link**, then **Create link**.
3. Set the link's expiration date, and optionally set a password. Click **Create Link**.

Amplitude generates a link to the content. Click **Copy Public Link** to copy the URL to your clipboard.

## Generate embed code for your content

Another way you can share your charts, notebooks, and dashboards with external stakeholders is by embedding your analysis into a document created outside of Amplitude Analytics. Paste the Amplitude-generated embed code into a tool that accepts embeds, like WordPress, Confluence, or wikis. Your Amplitude content becomes visible to unauthenticated users, in much the same way as public links.

To generate this embed code, follow these steps:

1. After saving your chart, dashboard, or notebook, click **Share**.
2. In the Share modal, click the Embed tab and flip the toggle switch to On.  
3. Click **Copy Embed Code**. You can now paste the embed code from your clipboard.
4. To revoke external permissions to view the content, flip the toggle switch to Off. The embed code no longer works in any of the documents where it appears.

## Copy, edit, or delete a public link

To manage your public links, navigate to *Settings > Organization Settings > Content Access*.

Public links aren't editable from the *Manage Content Access* page, but you can remove them from there. Hover over the public link to bring up the *Remove* button. To edit the link's password or change its expiration date, click on the name of the chart to open it, then click *Share* to begin making those changes.

## Set public link permissions

Admins on Enterprise plan accounts can control whether members need to set a password and/or expiration date when creating a public link. When setting an expiration, you can control how long public links exist before they expire.Â 

Even if your account doesn't require passwords or expirations, you can set either when creating a public link. Review [Create a public link](#create-a-public-link) for details.

Passwords aren't recoverable. If you forget your password, you can edit the link and choose a new one. If you choose to set an expiration date, any recipients receive an error message when opening the link after your selected date. You can always edit your link and choose a new expiration date if you need to extend access.
