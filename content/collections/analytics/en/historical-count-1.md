ai_summary: "With Historical Count in Amplitude, you can track users' actions like in-app purchases or song plays, up to the fifth instance. Identify friction points for first-time users and analyze best customers based on actions. This feature is available on all Amplitude plans. Historical Count is different from behavioral cohorts but can be used in them. It's a property in various charts like Event Segmentation and Retention Analysis. Historical Count helps you filter user actions by the number of times they've occurred. It's time-limited to one year and must be applied to events in specific ways. Apply a Historical Count filter by selecting the event and setting the N-value."

Have you ever noticed that conversion and retention rates can sometimes be very different for a user who has, for example, made one in-app purchase versus those who have made two or three?

With Historical Count, you can easily capture each *N*th instance of any user action (up to the **fifth**). This will help you quickly pinpoint and resolve areas of friction for first-time users, so that you can boost your overall [North Star metric](https://amplitude.com/resources/north-star-playbook?utm_source=google-ads&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Search_AMER_US_EN_NorthStarPlaybook&utm_content=157380484971&utm_term=north%20star%20metric&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAmsurBhBvEiwA6e-WPDh3pq27nPfj9ByxtdAL-XJ6DAegP6bnR3XTQXwdCk3YWrE3X8Ub2xoCDpcQAvD_BwE). 

You can also use it to identify your best customers based on the number of times they’ve taken a critical action in your product, like completing a purchase in an e-commerce platform or playing a song in a music streaming app. 

For example, if your product is a music streaming platform, Historical Count could highlight the usage differences between users who have performed the `Play Song` event for the first time and those who've triggered it multiple times.

Historical Count is not the same as Amplitude's behavioral cohorts. However, you can use Historical Count in a behavioral cohort.

### Feature availability

This feature is available to users on **all Amplitude plans**. See our [pricing page](https://amplitude.com/pricing) for more details.

## Before you begin

Before you get started using the Historical Count feature, there are some things you should know. If you're new to Amplitude, you'll need to complete the instrumentation process in order for your events to appear in any Amplitude charts. We recommend you start exploring the [Event Segmentation chart](/docs/analytics/charts/event-segmentation) first.

Other important things to note about this feature:

* The following operators are currently supported: `=` (is), `≠` (is not), `<` (less), `≤` (less or equal), `>` (greater), `≥`(greater or equal)
* Only one Historical Count property can be selected at a time.
* Historical Count is an event property available on the **Event Segmentation**, **Funnel** **Analysis**, **Pathfinder**, and **Retention Analysis** Charts.
	* In a funnel analysis, Historical Count works only on funnels set to *in this order*.
	* You can apply an Historical Count filter only to the first event in the Pathfinder and Retention Analysis charts.
	* However, you can apply it to multiple events when doing event segmentation and funnel analyses.

## How Amplitude defines Historical Count

Generally speaking, Historical Count can tell you if it's a user's first time triggering a specified event, or their fifth. But there are some constraints to be aware of here.

Amplitude's definition of ***N*th time** is itself time-limited, to include a period of **up to one year before** the beginning of the date range of your analysis.

For example, let's say a user performed the `Play Song` event for the first time on February 20th, 2019, and then did so again a month later, on March 20th, 2019. In order to include the user's **true** first performance of the `Play Song` event, your chart's date range **must begin no later** than February 19th, 2020. If your chart covers the period of, say, March 1st, 2020 to March 31st, 2020, Amplitude will then treat the event performed on March 20th, 2019 as the user's first interaction with the `Play Song` event.

## Apply a Historical Count filter

To apply a Historical Count filter, follow these steps:

1. In your Events Module, choose the event you're interested in. Then click *+ Filter by*.
2. Scroll down to *Amplitude Event Properties* and select *Historical Count*.
3. Choose the correct operator and specify the *N*-value (first through fifth) that you're interested in.

In the example above, the chart will include users who performed the `Send Message` event, with a Historical Count of three.
