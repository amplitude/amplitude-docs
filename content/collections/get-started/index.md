If you’re reading this, you’re probably brand-new to Amplitude. Welcome!

Our documentation has all kinds of valuable information for you as your usage of Amplitude grows. But for now, at the start of your Amplitude journey, this section will help you get Amplitude set up quickly, so you can be up and running as quickly as possible.

Start by learning about organizations and projects in Amplitude (your analyses live in projects, and all your projects live in your organization): 

* [Create your organization](/docs/get-started/create-org)
* [Instrumentation pre-work](/docs/get-started/instrumentation-prework)
* [Create a project in Amplitude](/docs/get-started/create-project)

Next, find out how to get your product data into Amplitude (you can’t do any analyses without data!), the specific events and properties you should consider tracking, and answers to some common implementation questions:

* [Get data into Amplitude](/docs/get-started/get-data-in)
* [What events will you need?](/docs/get-started/select-events)
* [How will you identify your users?](/docs/get-started/identify-users)
* [Questions your engineers may ask you](/docs/get-started/questions-from-your-engineer)
* [Cross-platform instrumentation vs. separate platform instrumentation](/docs/get-started/cross-platform-vs-separate-platform)
* [Track your progress as you instrument Amplitude](/docs/get-started/track-your-progress)

From there, learn how to create and share charts:

* [The Amplitude Home page](/docs/get-started/amplitude-home-page)
* [Create a chart](/docs/get-started/create-a-chart)
* [Spaces](/docs/get-started/spaces)
* [Start from a template](/docs/get-started/start-from-template)

Finally, we’ve put together some guidance on how you can generate some quick wins right now, so your company’s investment in Amplitude can begin paying off today:

* [Understand your users’ activity](/docs/get-started/understand-user-activity)
* [Analyze your acquisition channels](/docs/get-started/analyze-acquisition-channels)
* [Analyze feature adoption](/docs/get-started/analyze-feature-adoption)
* [Understand conversion rate of an important flow](/docs/get-started/understand-conversion-rate)
