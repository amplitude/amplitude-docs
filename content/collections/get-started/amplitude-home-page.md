In Amplitude, the Home page is where you can get a quick overview on what’s happening with your product. You can also find links to the last five items you visited in Amplitude, quickly create a new chart, or visit the template gallery.

You can go directly to the Home page anytime. Just click the Amplitude logo in the upper-left corner of the screen.

Right out of the box, the Home page acts as a dashboard that gives you an immediate understanding of how many users you have, how many are new, where they are, and what they’re doing. Once you get comfortable creating your own analyses in Amplitude, you can replace the included charts with others that make more sense for your organization.

The **real-time event stream** gives you a glimpse into what your users are doing in your product at any given moment. This is a list of the most recent events your users have triggered. You can click through any event to [instantly generate an Event Segmentation chart](/docs/analytics/user-data-lookup) screen.

You can open an empty Event Segmentation chart by clicking *Create a chart*, under the *Quick Actions* section. (You’ll have to fill in the events and properties yourself, though.) Or you can view all the available dashboard templates in the [template gallery](/docs/get-started/start-from-template) by clicking *Start from a template*.

Once you’re in the template gallery, you can open a template, modify it by adding your own relevant events, and then save it as a new dashboard.

And if you’re not sure what any of these terms mean, just click through the links in this article to read up on them in the Help Center.
