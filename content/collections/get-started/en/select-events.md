Events and properties are the backbone of every analysis in Amplitude. [Deciding which ones to track](/docs/data/create-tracking-plan) can be daunting, especially if you're new to product analytics.

## How many events should you track?

Often, we see new customers try to track most—or even all—of the actions a user could possibly take in their product. **Resist this urge**. Though it feels logical to say that more data will lead to more insights, it usually doesn't work out that way. Too much data actually **obscures** insights, burying them under an avalanche of events and properties you don't really need to know about.

The real answer to the question of how many events you should track depends entirely on the complexity of your product. If your app has a more focused feature set, you might only need to track 20 events or so; if your product is feature-rich, on the other hand, 200 might be more appropriate.

Finding the right number will require you to really think about **what kinds of insights** you're hoping to find via Amplitude. What are the questions you'd like Amplitude to help you answer in the next quarter? The next two quarters? Identify those, and choose the events that will lead you where you want to go.

## What events should you track?

No matter what, you should be tracking **any actions** that fit into these three categories:

* Those that are important in completing a process within your product, like completing a tutorial or signup process
* Those that guide a user through the main mechanics of your product
* Those that enable a user to make an in-app purchase

When you've decided which events to track, you'll be ready to [plan your events](/docs/data/data-planning-playbook) takes a deep dive into this question, so be sure to read that as well.
