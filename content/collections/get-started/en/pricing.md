Amplitude offers several pricing plans: 

* Starter
* Plus
* Growth
* Enterprise

Each tier offers diffrent levels of functionality and areas of expansion. Amplitude also lets you purchase add-on functionality to almost every pricing tier, so you can ensure that you're getting the functionality you need and not paying for functionality you're not using. 

Every pricing plan builds on the one before it. This means that the functionality included in the Starter plan is automatically included in the Plus plan. The Plus plan then expands upon the Starter plan functionality substantially. That expansion could be in functionality or it could be expanded volume. 

For example: 

* The Starter plan includes out-of-the-box analytics and templates. The Plus plan includes those analytics and templates and also lets you create unlimited analytics views. You can customize your analytics however you want. 
* The Starter plan offers 10k MTUs and up to 10M events. The Plus plan expands this volume to 300k MTUs or 25M events.

The Growth and Enterprise plans expand further on the Plus plan. For example: 

* Growth and Enterprise plans both offer customer MTU or event volumes.
* The Growth plan offers advanced behavioral analysis. The Enterprise plan offers behavioral analysis as well as Cross-product analysis.
