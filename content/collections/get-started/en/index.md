ai_summary: 'In Amplitude, you can create organizations and projects for your analyses. Learn how to get your product data into Amplitude and track specific events and user identification. Create and share charts, start from templates, and track your progress. Generate quick wins by understanding user activity, analyzing acquisition channels, feature adoption, and conversion rates. To get started, create an Amplitude account, verify your email, and explore the demo environment to see what Amplitude offers. If you have questions about instrumentation, refer to the provided article.'

Start by learning about organizations and projects in Amplitude (your analyses live in projects, and all your projects live in your organization): 

* [Create a new aCCOUNT](/docs/get-started/create-a-new-account)
* [Instrumentation pre-work](/docs/get-started/instrumentation-prework)
* [Create a project in Amplitude](/docs/get-started/create-project)

Next, find out how to get your product data into Amplitude (you can’t do any analyses without data!), the specific events and properties you should consider tracking, and answers to some common implementation questions:

* [Get data into Amplitude](/docs/get-started/get-data-in)
* [What events will you need?](/docs/get-started/select-events)
* [How will you identify your users?](/docs/get-started/identify-users)
* [Questions your engineers may ask you](/docs/get-started/questions-from-your-engineer)
* [Cross-platform instrumentation vs. separate platform instrumentation](/docs/get-started/cross-platform-vs-separate-platform)
* [Track your progress as you instrument Amplitude](/docs/get-started/track-your-progress)

From there, learn how to create and share charts:

* [The Amplitude Home page](/docs/get-started/amplitude-home-page)
* [Create a chart](/docs/get-started/create-a-chart)
* [Spaces](/docs/get-started/spaces)
* [Start from a template](/docs/get-started/start-from-template)

Finally, we’ve put together some guidance on how you can generate some quick wins right now, so your company’s investment in Amplitude can begin paying off today:

* [Understand your users’ activity](/docs/get-started/understand-user-activity)
* [Analyze your acquisition channels](/docs/get-started/analyze-acquisition-channels)
* [Analyze feature adoption](/docs/get-started/analyze-feature-adoption)
* [Understand conversion rate of an important flow](/docs/get-started/understand-conversion-rate)

Still need to create your Amplitude account? Just follow these steps to get started.

1. **Create an Amplitude Account**. If you haven't already, [just click here](https://amplitude.com/get-started) to sign up for an Amplitude account. You will be directed to explore the [demo](https://analytics.amplitude.com/login/my-demo) environment, where we've set up dashboards and charts that allow you to see some of what Amplitude can do for you.
2. **Verify your email.** You will receive an email from Amplitude, asking you to verify your email address. Click the link it contains to set a password and finish creating your account. Once completed, you will be redirected back to the demo environment, where you can click *Set up on the Free Plan* at the top of the page to set up your own Amplitude implementation.
