The charts included on the **Feature Adoption Report template** help you gain a deeper understanding of the customer behaviors linked to conversion and drop-off. There’s no setup required, though you can easily customize the template itself and the individual charts included with it if you need to.

The Feature Adoption Report template includes the following charts:

* How many unique users do `Any Active Event` each day?
* How many times does `Any Active Event` happen each day?
* What percentage of active users do `Any Active Event` each day?
* What percentage of unique users do `Any Active Event` for the first time each day?
* On average, how many times does each user do `Any Active Event` each day?
* On average, how many times does `Any Active Event` happen per session?
* How many times does each unique user do `Any Active Event` in 30 days?
* How many users return to do `Any Active Event` after their first time?

For a more detailed view into any of these questions, simply click the title of the chart you’re interested in.

## Customize the Feature Adoption Report template

You can customize this or any template by first converting it into a **dashboard**. In Amplitude, templates and dashboards are related but distinct concepts. A [dashboard](/docs/analytics/dashboard-create) is a single, convenient view of several related charts; you’d use a dashboard to share insights with other stakeholders in your Amplitude project. A template is a re-usable version of a dashboard; you’d use it to make other, similar dashboards, which you could then customize to meet the specific needs of a different project.

To turn the template into a dashboard, follow these steps:

1. From the dropdown in the upper left, select the Amplitude project you want this dashboard to track. If you want it to track the current project, just leave it as-is.
2. Under *Events*, select the events you want to use for the charts in this dashboard.   
  
For example, if you’re interested in questions around **feature discovery**, select an event that signals successful feature usage. If you’re more interested in the **value moment** that results in a conversion, select an event that reflects the desired user behavior. For a streaming service, this might be `Video Watched`, while for an e-commerce company it might be `Complete Purchase`.  
  
You don't have to supply an event for anything you aren't ready to track right now. 
  
3. Click *Save As Dashboard*, give your new dashboard a name, and select a location to save it in. Then click *Save*.

Your dashboard is now ready to use.
