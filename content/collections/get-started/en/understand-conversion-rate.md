The charts included on the **Conversion Report template** give you a deeper understanding of the customer behaviors linked to conversion and drop-off. You can easily apply it to any important in-product flow. There’s no setup required, though you can easily customize the template itself and the individual charts included with it if you need to.

The Conversion Report template includes the following charts:

* What's the conversion rate of this funnel?
* How is the conversion rate changing over time?
* How long does it take users to convert?
* How many times do users do `New User` before doing `Any Active Event`?
* What paths do users take to get to `Any Active Event`?

For a more detailed view into any of these questions, simply click the title of the chart you’re interested in.

## Customize the User Activity template

You can customize this or any template by first converting it into a **dashboard**. In Amplitude, templates and dashboards are related but distinct concepts. A [dashboard](/docs/analytics/dashboard-create) is a single, convenient view of several related charts; you’d use a dashboard to share insights with other stakeholders in your Amplitude project. A template is a re-usable version of a dashboard; you’d use it to make other, similar dashboards, which you could then customize to meet the specific needs of a different project.

To turn the template into a dashboard, follow these steps:

1. From the dropdown in the upper left, select the Amplitude project you want this dashboard to track. If you want it to track the current project, just leave it as-is.
2. Under *Events*, select the active event you want to use for the charts in this dashboard.  
  
You may want to replace the default `Any Active Event` event with something more specific. If so, consider selecting an event that clearly reflects the desired user behavior. For a streaming service, this might be `Video Watched`, while for an ecommerce company, it might be `Complete Purchase`.  
  
Scroll until you find the event you’re interested in and select it.  
  
You don't have to change the default active event if you don't want to. 
  
3. Click *Save As Dashboard*, give your new dashboard a name, and select a location to save it in. Then click *Save*.

Your dashboard is now ready to use.
