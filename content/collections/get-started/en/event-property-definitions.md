By default, Amplitude tracks the event properties listed in the following table automatically, as they relate to page-viewed events. Some are tracked with client-side SDKs, and others, like Event Day of Week or Session Replay ID, are generated by Amplitude.

Amplitude prefixes these properties with the Amplitude logo when you see them in the application. If you prefer, configure Amplitude's SDKs to disable automatic tracking of these properties.
