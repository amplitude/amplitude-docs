The charts included on the User Activity Report template deliver insights into the frequency and duration of your users' engagement with your product. There’s no setup required, though you can easily customize the template itself and the individual charts included with it if you need to.

The User Activity Report template includes the following charts:

* How many users are active each day?
* What percent of active users are new users?
* What percent of active users are returning?
* How long is the average session?
* When do these users come back?
* Breakdown of these users by device family
* Breakdown of these users by country
* Breakdown of these users by platform

For a more detailed view into any of these questions, simply click the title of the chart you’re interested in.

## Customize the User Activity template

You can customize this or any template by first converting it into a **dashboard**. In Amplitude, templates and dashboards are related but distinct concepts. A [dashboard](/docs/analytics/dashboard-create) is a single, convenient view of several related charts; you’d use a dashboard to share insights with other stakeholders in your Amplitude project. A template is a re-usable version of a dashboard; you’d use it to make other, similar dashboards, which you could then customize to meet the specific needs of a different project.

To turn the template into a dashboard, follow these steps:

1. Select the appropriate project from the dropdown in the upper left of the screen.
2. Under *Events,* select the event you want to use as the **active event**. The default value is `Any Active Event`. If you want to use something more specific, scroll until you find the event you’re interested in and select it.  
  
You don't have to replace `Any Active Event` if you’d prefer not to.

3. Click *Save As Dashboard*, give your new dashboard a name, and select a location to save it. Then click *Save*.

Your dashboard is now ready to use.
