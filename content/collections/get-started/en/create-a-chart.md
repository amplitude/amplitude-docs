**Charts** are the heart of almost any Amplitude analysis. To create a new chart, click *Create > Chart*, then select a new chart type from the Charts flyout.

### Feature availability

This feature is available to users on **all Amplitude plans**.

### Restrictions

This feature is **limited** for users on **Starter plans**. 

* Organizations on a Starter plan can save up to ten charts

For a high-level overview of each chart type, check out this [overview of charts and features](/docs/analytics/charts/find-the-right-chart).

Find and add relevant [events](/docs/analytics/charts/build-charts-add-events), [properties](/docs/data/user-properties-and-events), and [user segments](/docs/analytics/charts/build-charts-add-user-segments) for your chart to generate useful information from it. Follow those links to learn more about those elements of an Amplitude analysis. You can also just start from a [pre-built template](/docs/get-started/start-from-template)instead.

To save your chart, click *Save*.

If this is your first time saving your chart, fill in all the relevant information in the Save modal that appears. Give your chart a name and description, add it to a dashboard or notebook, and specify whether you want others in your organization to be able to find and view your dashboard.

Once you've saved your chart, the *More* drop-down menu offers several options for managing and working with your chart:

* **Unlisted:** This option enables other members of your organization to find your chart. Keep in mind that admins and managers can always find saved charts, whether they're listed or unlisted.
* **Open Notebook View:** This opens the notebook flyout panel, where you can preview your chart in notebook format. You can also add your chart to a [notebook](/docs/analytics/notebooks) from here, by selecting the notebook you want and clicking *+ Add chart to notebook*.
* **Export:** This enables you to share your chart as a PNG, PDF, CSV, or [shared link](/docs/analytics/share-external).
* **Save As:** This lets you save a new copy of your chart.
* **Move:** This lets you move your chart to a different space or folder.
* **Copy:** This opens a copy of your chart in a new browser tab.
* **Comment:** This enables you to leave a comment on your chart.
* **Revert:** This restores the most-recently saved version of this chart.
* **Archive:** You should archive a chart when it's no longer relevant to your analyses. Users can still search for archived charts in Search. Archiving a chart disables all [shared links](/docs/analytics/share-external) associated with that chart. However, when the chart is un-archived, the shared links reactivate.

Once you’ve populated a chart with data, you can zoom in on it by dragging diagonally across the chart and creating a rectangle over the section of the chart you'd like to view in more detail. Restore the full view by clicking *Reset zoom*.
