ai_summary: "In Amplitude, **Spaces** help you subscribe to and organize shared analyses. You save content into your personal workspace by default, but can move it to a shared space. Each piece of content can only be saved in one location, but you can create shortcuts to it in other spaces. This feature is available on all Amplitude plans but has restrictions for Starter and Plus plans. Your personal space is where you save content; it's not visible to others, but they can find discoverable content through search. You can create folders to group related content and create new spaces for collaboration."

Some of the most valuable analyses are the result of collaborations among teammates. **Spaces** help product teams subscribe to and organize analyses shared in Amplitude.

Every saved piece of content must live in a space. By default, you save content into your personal workspace. You can also choose to move them into a shared space.

You can save a piece of content to one location only, but you can create [shortcuts](/docs/analytics/collaborate-with-spaces) to that content in other spaces.

### Feature availability

This feature is available to users on **all Amplitude plans**.

### Restrictions

This feature is **limited** for users on **Starter** and **Plus plans**. 

* Organizations on **Starter** plans can use **one space**
* Organizations on **Plus** plans can use up to to **three spaces**

## Your personal space

This is the default location for content that you save. Access it by clicking on your name in the *Favorite Spaces* tab of the *Spaces* drop-down. All your charts, notebooks, dashboards, folders, and archives are here, unless you opt to save them into a different space.

Your personal workspace and the folders within it are **not visible** to other people in your organization. Team members can still search for any content you've designated as **discoverable,** via Amplitude’s search feature (assuming they have project permissions to view it), and you can still share links to content that are inside your personal workspace.

Click on a piece of content to open and edit it. To move, rename, archive, or pin a piece of content, check the box next to the content's name and click the appropriate button in the toolbar at the top of the list.

### Create a new folder

Folders are a convenient way to group related content together in a single, easily viewable spot. To create a folder in a space, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your space and click *New Folder*.
2. In the modal that appears, give your folder a name and click *Create folder*.
3. Add content to your folder now, if you want. You can also do that later.

## Create a space

To create a space, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to *Spaces > Create New Space*.
2. Enter a name for your space, as well as a description, in the appropriate fields of the modal that appears.
3. In the *Members* field, select everyone who you want to join your new space. When you've finished, click *Create space*.

Users with admin, manager, and member-level permissions can create a space.

Use naming conventions for your space that are recognizable throughout the organization, so that others can easily understand what the team space is all about.

A space can reuse a previously used name for a new project, as long as that project was deleted. 

There’s a lot more to effectively using spaces, so when you’re ready to explore further, check out [this article in the Amplitude documentation](/docs/analytics/collaborate-with-spaces).
