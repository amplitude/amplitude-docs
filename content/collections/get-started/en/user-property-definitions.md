ai_summary: 'Amplitude automatically tracks user properties like country, city, region, and more. It uses IP addresses for location data. You can configure the SDKs to stop tracking certain properties. When creating charts, you need to provide specific values for some segments. If you send data server-side, you must set properties explicitly. The table lists various user properties like platform, device, and language. "Paying" changes to "true" after a revenue event. Remember, you can''t group by certain properties in charts. Make sure to manage unique identifiers like user ID yourself.'
---
By default, Amplitude tracks the user properties listed in the table below automatically, via client-side [SDKs](https://www.docs.developers.amplitude.com/data/sdks/sdk-overview/#analytics-sdks). All these properties will be prefixed with the Amplitude logo whenever you encounter them in Amplitude. If you prefer, configure Amplitude's SDKs to disable automatic tracking of these properties:

* [Browser SDK](/docs/sdks/analytics/browser/browser-sdk-2#optional-tracking)
* [iOS SDK](/docs/sdks/analytics/ios/ios-swift-sdk#disable-tracking)
* [Android SDK](/docs/sdks/analytics/android/android-kotlin-sdk#disable-tracking)

Amplitude uses the collected IP address to determine a user's location properties (`City`, `Country` , `Region`, and `DMA`) using the [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com/en/home) database. MaxMind is widely accepted as the most reliable digital mapping source.

In Amplitude charts, if you choose to segment by device ID, event ID, latitude, longitude, server upload time, session ID, user ID, or ID, you'll have to supply the exact values you're looking yourself. Additionally, you will not be able to group by event ID, latitude, longitude, server upload time, or ID.

{{partial:admonition type="note"}}
If you send data server-side instead of using an SDK, Amplitude cannot track these user properties automatically. You must instead set these properties explicitly.

Once a property is set to "true", it will not change. You can manually change this value via Amplitude's [Identify API](/docs/apis/analytics/identify): "true", null/none |

| User ID       | The user ID of the user. This should be a unique user identifier of the user and should never change for the same user, e.g. a hashed string of the user's username. This is explicitly set by the customer; Amplitude does not auto-populate this field.
