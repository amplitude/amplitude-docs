Creating charts with aligning settings can be difficult and time consuming when analyzing experiment results in *both* Amplitude Experiment and Analytics. To combat this issue, users can import or export chart settings' data as JSON.

Follow these steps to copy settings as JSON from Experiment to Analytics:

1. While in any tab in Experiment, click the *More* dropdown and select *Copy flag as JSON* to copy chart settings to your clipboard.

2. From an Experiment Results chart in Analytics, click *Import*.

3. Paste the copied settings in the *Import from JSON* window, then click *Apply* to exactly match your experiment's configuration.

### JSON schema

The JSON copied to your clipboard contains a set of fields that completely describe the inputs to an Experiment Results chart. The fields differ slightly from what you might see in the version history for an experiment or feature flag.

* variants - Array of objects with the following keys:

	* name - The custom name set for the variant.
	* userPropertyValue - The variant value, used to build segment conditions when converting variants to segments in the chart.
* bucketingGroupType - The unit of analysis. See [Experiment: Account Level Analysis](/docs/feature-experiment/analysis-view) for more information.
* userProperty - The Amplitude user property that identifies users exposed to each treatment. Used to build segment conditions when converting variants to segments in the chart. See [this article on event tracking in Amplitude](/docs/feature-experiment/under-the-hood/event-tracking) for more information.
* metrics - An array of metric objects, including test direction, MDE, events, and analysis type.
* experimentStartDate - The start date of the experiment.
* experimentEndDate - The end date for the date picker, or today if the experiment is still running.
* exposureEvent - The exposure event and filters for the experiment. When your experiment is configured to use the default Amplitude exposure event, the event type will always be "*[Experiment] Exposure"*. See [this article on exposure tracking in Amplitude](/docs/feature-experiment/under-the-hood/event-tracking#exposure-event) for more information about exposure events.
