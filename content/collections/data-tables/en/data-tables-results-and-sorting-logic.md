For more complex analyses, it's important to understand how Amplitude Analytics decides what results to display, as well as what happens when you sort on a given column.

* If your group-by includes a large number of different property values, Amplitude Analytics displays the top 100 group-by results. With multiple top-level group-bys, the limit is 500.
* If you're nesting group-bys, Amplitude Analytics applies the limit to each one separately. For example, if you have a top-level group-by around the `city` property, where the limit is 100, Amplitude Analytics only displays the top 100 group-by results. If you add a second-level group-by around the `email` property, a maximum of 100 emails display for each city.
* Any metric with attribution has a limit of 20 results.
* If your Data Table includes metrics with different limits, the **smallest** row limit applies.
* If your table contains metrics that aren't segmentation-based (like conversion, attribution, or session), **and** you're doing multiple group-bys, you may see fewer results than the limits described here might suggest. Contact your CSM or Amplitude Support if this is an issue.

## Sorting logic

Once you have these results, any sorting you do applies **only to them**, and **doesn't** bring in any new results. 

For example, imagine your group-by has enough different property values that Amplitude Analytics limits the results displayed to the top 100. By default, Amplitude sorts these results in descending order. If you opt to view your results in ascending order, **you don't** see the “bottom 100” results instead. You **still** see only the same top 100 results—only their sorting order has changed.

When using multiple metrics, sorting by a particular column displays data for all columns based on the values in the sorted column. For a data table with multiple segments, multiple metrics, and a period over period comparison, sorting a period-over-period column within a metric gives you a dataset based on the first segment's current period.

## Limits for .CSV exports

Results exported to .CSV have row limits based on the metric type. If the data table contains multiple metrics of different kinds, the smallest row limit applies. Amplitude Analytics prunes rows exceeding the limit, and they don't appear in the exported .CSV.

* Event segmentation metrics **without** attribution have a limit of 10,000 rows.
* Funnel metrics **without** attribution have a limit of 300 rows.
* Session metrics have a limit of 100 rows.
* Any metric **with** attribution has a  limit of 20 rows.

## Limits for Dashboard REST API queries

With results queried from the [Dashboard REST API](/docs/apis/analytics/dashboard-rest), event segmentation metrics have a limit of 1000 rows. This is the only difference from the .CSV limits described in the previous section.

## How time properties work in Data Tables

When you apply time properties as group-bys, all limits described above apply to each group of the property.

### Examples:

* If you are using multiple top-level group-bys, the display limit is 500 rows.   
If, for example, you add another top-level group-by for the month property (a time-related property), and the date range includes three months (and thus, three different values for the property), up to 1500 rows (500 rows \* three property values) display in the Data Table.
* If you export a funnel metric without attribution, grouped by a non-time property, the .CSV export result limit is 300 rows.   
If, for example, you add another top-level group-by for the day property (a time property), and the date range includes seven days (and thus, seven different values for the property), up to 2100 rows (300 rows * seven property values) export to your .CSV.
*  The 10,000 row limit for event segmentation metrics without attribution **doesn't apply** if the final group-by in the top level group includes a time property.
