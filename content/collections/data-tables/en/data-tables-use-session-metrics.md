ai_summary: "In Amplitude Analytics, you can find session metrics like bounce rate and exit rate in the Data Tables charts under the Metrics tab. These metrics aren't standalone but are calculated based on the group-by you select. You need to be on Growth or Enterprise plans to access this feature. By selecting the right group-by property, you can analyze session metrics and understand user interactions on your app or site. Session metrics such as bounce, entry, and exit rates are crucial for evaluating user engagement. Remember, these metrics are calculated based on the group-by property you choose."

Sometimes considered "legacy metrics," **session metrics**, like bounce rate or exit rate—are helpful diagnostic tools for obtaining a deeper understanding of the performance of campaigns or content items.

In Amplitude Analytics, you can find session metrics in the Data Tables charts, on the *Metrics* tab. Other than session totals, session metrics—bounce rate, exit rate, entry rate, entries, and exits—aren't available as standalone metrics in Amplitude Analytics. Instead, Amplitude calculates these session metrics from the group-by you select, and will only include **active events** in the computation. Amplitude Analytics uses the group-by to decide how many values are present, and the sequence to be used for calculation.

### Feature availability

This feature is available to users on **Growth** and **Enterprise plans** only. See our [pricing page](https://amplitude.com/pricing) for more details.

## Select a good group-by property

The most common properties to select for your group-by are page- or screen-level properties that change as a user interacts with your app or site. These work well because they're likely to vary between most of the relevant events, and are set frequently enough to signal a bounce when needed.

## Example: Group-bys and session metrics

Amplitude uses the number of values of your group-by property to decide whether to classify a session as a specific metric, such as bounce, entry, or exit.

Here are three example sessions:

### Session 1

1. Event: `Page View`  
	`Page` = A
2. Event: `Click`  
	`Name` = 1A  
	`Type` = Ad
3. Event: `Page View`  
	`Page` = B

### Session 2

1. Event: `Page View`  
	`Page` = B  
	`Name` = 1A  
	`Type` = Ad

2. Event: `Click`  
	`Name` = 1B  
	`Type` = Ad

### Session 3

1. Event: `Buy`  
	`Amt` = $15  
	`Prod` = 1

A `Page View` event is either a default event captured through the Browser SDK, specified in the settings in Amplitude’s Marketing Space, or defined in a Data Tables analysis as a bounce rate metric.

### Bounce

A bounce is a session where the user triggers only one `Page View` event. This is also known as a single-page session. 

Amplitude calculates the bounce rate as a percentage based on the following formula: 

```
count of single-page sessions / the **total** number of sessions
```

Amplitude calculates bounce rates with a group-by by:

```
count of single-page sessions grouped by the first **non-null** property value /   
the total number of sessions grouped by the first **non-null** property value
```

To decide if the example sessions above are a bounce:

* Regardless of the group-by property, like `Page` or `Name`, **Session 1** would **not** be counted as a bounce because it contains more than one `Page View` event.
* **Session 2** only contains one `Page View` event. If you grouped by the `Name` event property, Amplitude Analytics **will** classify this session as a bounce. It would be grouped by the `Name` value of "1A" since it appears first in the session, and the bounce rate would be 1 / 2 (50 percent).
* Regardless of the group-by property, **Session 3** would **not** be counted as a bounce because it does not contain any `Page View` events.

### Entry and exit

Session **Entries** are defined by the **first** non-null value for the group by's property within the session. Session **Exits** are defined by the **last** non-null value for the group by's property within the session.

The entry and exit rates are then calculated as a percentage using the following formula:

```
the number of entries or exits / the **total** number of sessions
```

{{partial:admonition type='note'}}
 Overall entry/exit rates are always 100 percent because every session has entry/exit values.
{{/partial:admonition}}

Example, for the same sessions above:

* If you group by the `Name` event property, both the entry and exit rates are grouped under "1A" because it's the first property value of `Name`. The entry rate would be 2 / 3 (66.66 percent) and the exit rate 1 / 3, or 33.33 percent.
* If you group by the `Page` event property, the entry and exit rates are grouped by “B.” The entry rate would be 1 / 3, or roughly 33.33 percent. The exit rate would be 2 / 3 (66.66 percent).

## Differences between session totals and PROPCOUNT(session IDs)

It's common to want to compare results of one Amplitude chart versus another, but not all chart analyses are interchangeable.

For example, you can't compare the results of a session totals query in a Session Metrics chart versus the [PROPCOUNT](/docs/analytics/charts/event-segmentation/event-segmentation-custom-formulas)(session IDs) formula in the Event Segmentation chart.

These two analyses can't be compared because of the following differences in their logic:

| Session totals query in Session Metrics chart                 | PROPCOUNT(session IDs) formula in an Event Segmentation chart                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
