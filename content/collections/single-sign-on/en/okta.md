Amplitude provides a single sign-on integration with Okta for customers on Scholarship, Growth, or Enterprise plans.

## Before you begin

For some general information about SSO, see [this article on SSO in Amplitude](/docs/admin/single-sign-on/sso).

In order to set up SSO, you must be an org admin for your Amplitude organization. You must also be able to configure your organization in Okta.

## Set up SSO for Amplitude using Okta

To configure SSO for Amplitude using Okta, follow these steps:

1. In Okta, navigate to the admin dashboard and clickÂ *Applications*.
2. On the *Applications* page, click *Create App Integration*.
