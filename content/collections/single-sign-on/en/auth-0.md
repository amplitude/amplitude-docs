Amplitude provides a single sign-on integration with Auth0 for customers on Scholarship, Growth, or Enterprise plans.

## Before you begin

For some general information about Single Sign-On (SSO), review [SSO in Amplitude](/docs/admin/single-sign-on/sso).

To set up SSO, you must be an org admin for your Amplitude organization. You must also have the permissions to configure Auth0 for your organization.

## Set up SSO for Amplitude using Auth0

To configure SSO for Amplitude using Auth0, follow these steps:

1. In Auth0, navigate to the *[Clients](https://manage.auth0.com/#/clients)* page.
2. Click *+ Create Client* to create a new client for Amplitude. Don't worry about specifying the client type; Amplitude communicates with Auth0 over SAML.

3. Navigate to the *Addons* tab and switch the SAML2 plugin toggle to "enabled."
