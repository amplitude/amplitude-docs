Predictions allow you to segment your users based on their likelihood to perform specific events or actions in the future.

## Build a prediction

To build a prediction in Amplitude Activation, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to *Cohorts & Audiences* and click *Predictions* in the left rail. Then click *+ Create Prediction*.
2. Next, click *Start with All Users* to apply this prediction to all user who’ve been active in the last 90 days, or define your own starting cohort.
3. If you choose to define your own starting cohort, select the users to include in the cohort. Under *Define starting cohort*, select the events, properties, or statuses that users in your cohort share.
4. Next, specify the action you want the starting cohort to take. Under *Define future outcome*, specify the events you want, or don’t want, your users to fire, the properties you want them to have after taking an action, or some combination of all three. Be sure to specify the time frame in which you want your users to take this future action.

Another way to think about a prediction is as a **cohort transition**: you’re predicting the relative likelihood of a user to transition from Cohort A (the starting cohort) to Cohort B (the future outcome) in the coming week.

5. If desired, **you may choose to add optional settings** under *Advanced Model Configuration*. This section allows you to further define your starting cohort by either including or excluding specific user properties. Click *Add Feature* under *Include* or *Exclude* to search for user properties to further define your starting cohort. Click *Save*.
6. Give your prediction a name and add a brief description. Then click *Save*. It takes about an hour for Amplitude Activation to build your prediction. Amplitude sends you an email when the prediction is ready.

## Analyze your prediction

Once Amplitude Activation has finished building your prediction, you’ll want to take a look at the results. Depending on what you see, you’ll either save the prediction as a cohort, or start over with a new prediction.

1. To view the results of your prediction, click the *Predictions* tab from the Cohorts & Audiences page. This shows you a list of all the predictions created so far.
2. Find your prediction and click it to open the prediction explorer's *Audience analysis* tab. Here, you’ll see the distribution of all users in your starting cohort:

   * The Y-axis shows the likelihood a user converts (for example, arrive at the future outcome you specified earlier)
   * The X-axis shows the percentile of users

You can select a range of users by percentile and see how many users fall in the range, the predicted conversion rate of users in that range, and the likelihood of conversion for those users relative to the average.

{{partial:admonition type='note'}}
Percentile and probability aren't the same thing. If you select the 80% - 100% percentile range, this doesn't mean the users in it have an 80% - 99% probability to convert. Instead, it means they’re in the top 20% of users, as ranked by probability to convert.

### Feature importance

“Black box” predictions aren’t generally insightful. That’s why Amplitude ranks the events and user properties that are most important to your predictive model in the *Feature Importance* section, which you can find just below the *Audience definition* chart. 

The *Events* tab in *Feature Importance* houses a table with the following columns and insights:

* The *Ratio* column is a ranking of events or properties according to their importance to the model. It’s computed by comparing the percentage of users in the selected percentile range who fire an event  to those not in the selected percentile range.
* The *Event* column lists the ranked events.
* The *% in Range* column specifies the percentage of users in the selected percentile range who fired the respective event. Sort by this column to rank events according to total level of engagement.
* The *% not in range* column calculates the percentage of users that performed the event but aren't in the selected cohort.
* The *Frequency* column displays the average number of times a user in the selected range fires an event. Sort by this column to rank events according to total level of engagement.

Click *Showing Significant Events* to narrow down your list of ranked events and modify which events you see in the table, or click the calendar icon to change the specified time frame and offset. The modified time frame applies to both the *Events* and *User Properties* tabs.

The *User Properties* tab allows you to view rankings of user properties and their importance to the prediction's model. Click *Select Property* to choose a user property for review. Like the Events table, the *User Properties* table ranks property values by *Ratio*, *% in range*, and *% not in range* columns. If desired, you can check the box next to *Show Hidden Property Values* to ensure they're visible in the table's results. 

### Model performance

At this point, you can evaluate the accuracy of your prediction. Amplitude provides metrics for you to do this in the *Model performance* tab:

* **True Positive Rate**: this is the ratio of predicted users who convert
* **False Positive Rate**: this is the ratio of predicted users who don't convert
* **AUC**, or Accuracy: technically, this is the area under the curve, a measure that weighs both true positive and false positive rates
* **Log loss**, or predicted vs actuals: this compares the predicted conversion rates to observed historical conversion rates and gives you the difference, in percentage terms

Generally speaking, a good model has an accuracy of at least 70%. Any model with an accuracy of 50% or less is no better than a coin flip in its predictive ability.

### Tips for a good predictive model

* **Outcome event has at least 50** **unique actions per day**: Ensure that the outcome event has at least 50 (ideally 100) unique user actions every day. If the conversion numbers are below this threshold the model doesn't detect signals and it recommends the same content for all users.
* **Ensure the targeted user cohort for Audiences has between 1K and 10M users**: If the user population is under 1K they can't use Audiences at a 1:1 level. If the population is greater than 10M users, Amplitude filters the cohort.
* **Use a large enough dataset**: The more data you have, the more accurate your recommendations is. Amplitude requires a minimum of 10,000 events per user to build a prediction.
* **Relevant events in Amplitude related to desired outcome**: Cross reference the desired outcome and confirm the appropriate events are already instrumented. These are typically `Purchase` or `Transaction completed`.

## Build a cohort from your prediction

Once you’ve got a useful prediction, you can save it as a cohort. This enables you to return to it in the future and repeatedly use it in targeting campaigns.

To save your prediction as a cohort, follow these steps:

1. Use the slider to select the desired percentile range on the chart. Then click *Save as predictive cohort*.
2. Give your cohort a name and click *Save*.

While it can be tempting to just slice the starting cohort into two sections, for example, top 20% vs bottom 80%, or top 50% vs bottom 50%, other approaches can give you far more useful results:

* **Probability inflection**: Find the spot where the distribution graph spikes exponentially, and split users along the spikes. This groups users into broadly similar buckets of predicted conversion rates.
* **Sample size:** If you have an idea of how many users you want to target in a growth campaign, then select that percentage on the right side of the chart. For example, if you want to target 2000 users and you have 20,000 users in the starting cohort, then simply select the top 10%.
* **Minimum detectable lift.** If you plan to target the selected users in a growth campaign, make sure the sample size is large enough to detect incremental lift. For example, if the top 20% of a prediction is 20,000 users, but the predicted conversion rate is 1%, you won’t be able to detect lift at statistically significant levels. Instead, you must increase the sample size to top 45% of users at 45,000 users.

When a user’s probabilities change, Amplitude Activation will automatically adjust their cohort membership if they fall into or out of the selected percentile range.

## Analyze your predictive cohort

Once you save a prediction as a cohort, you can use it for analysis in any Amplitude Analytics chart. Here are some suggestions for analyses using prediction-derived cohorts:

* **Create top 20% and bottom 80% cohorts** to compare the best and worst users. Set them as different segments in the right module of any chart.
* **Event Segmentation:** see the historical behavioral trends of best users vs worst users prior to converting.
* **Pathfinder:** identify the different sequences of actions users take if they have a high likelihood vs low likelihood to convert.
* **Composition:** break down the property values of the respective cohorts to differences in user properties (i.e., which countries the best users vs worst users are in).
* **Engagement Matrix:** compare the events fired by the best users vs the worst users, based on the balance of frequency and % of users.
* **Funnel:** compare relative conversion rates for any sequence of actions between the best users and worst users.
