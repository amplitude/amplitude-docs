  - 'Interpret the different charts within usage reports'
---
Amplitude's **usage reports** help you identify trends and patterns of Amplitude usage within your organization. Use it to better understand where your company’s analytics practice is strongest, as well as opportunities to further maximize the value your organization gets from Amplitude. 

### Feature availability

This feature is available to users on **Growth** and **Enterprise plans** only. See our [pricing page](https://amplitude.com/pricing) for more details.

## Access usage reports

Usage reports include ten charts (visible on the User Metrics tab) that deliver the metrics you need to effectively drive Amplitude adoption in your organization, as well as a report (visible on the Event Usage tab) that describes how your ingested events are being used within Amplitude across all projects in your organization.

Usage reports are accessible by navigating to *Settings >* *Organization settings >* *Usage Reports*.

{{partial:admonition type='note'}}
 Only admins or managers on all projects can view usage reports.

## The User Metrics tab

User metrics provide insight on how users within your organization used Amplitude over the defined time period.

### Summary of metrics and users

The Summary Metrics chart displays the total number of users in your organization, along with several metrics that summarize key aspects of your organization's Amplitude adoption and engagement. The three trend over time metrics give you the percentage change in retention, weekly learning users, broadcasted learnings, and engagement by team over the past 90 days.

### User metrics

![usage_reports_user_metrics.png](/docs/output/img/billing-use/usage-reports-user-metrics-png.png)

The User Metrics panel is provides information on active user count, top users and teams, and depth of engagement. You can set the active users chart to display data on a monthly, weekly, or daily basis by clicking on the appropriate buttons in the top corner. The summary statistics included in this chart work the same as the ones you’ll find in the [KPI view](#detailed-kpis). 

The Top Users / Teams chart shows which users or teams in your organization performed the most queries in Amplitude. In this chart, a "query" occurs whenever someone creates or loads a chart, dashboard, or notebook. When you switch from top users to top teams, the value shown reflects the teams selected by users when they created their Amplitude account

Amplitude calculates depth of engagement using the number of edits per session as a proxy. More edits suggest users are highly engaged in the charts they’re viewing.

### Detailed KPIs

The Detailed KPIs panel gives you a more in-depth look at some metrics shared in the Summary Metrics panel. **Weekly learning users** is a way to measure the breadth of Amplitude engagement in your organization: it’s the count of active Amplitude users who’ve shared a learning which is then consumed by at least two other people in the previous seven days. 

**Broadcasted learnings** measures depth. It's based on a count of charts, dashboards, and notebooks consumed by two or more people in a seven-day period. [Learn more about the metrics and why they're important](https://amplitude.com/north-star/amplitudes-north-star-metric-and-inputs).

### Content Usage

## The Event Usage tab

The Events Usage tab provides a downloadable, **organization-level** usage report in .CSV or JSON format, detailing use of events across all projects and portfolios within your org. This helps organization admins review Amplitude use across your company. Generate an up-to-date report whenever you like by clicking *Generate Report*.

Amplitude measures event use by **queries**. Amplitude defines a query as the **selection of an event** in the definition of a chart, segment, or cohort. When you use [custom events](/docs/analytics/charts/event-segmentation/event-segmentation-in-line-events) or metrics that are composed of multiple events,  Amplitude tallies queries for each component event separately.

![Screenshot_2023-04-24_at_17.47.39.png](/docs/output/img/billing-use/screenshot-2023-04-24-at-17-47-39-png.png)

Amplitude also tallies queries for events queried in [cross-project views](/docs/analytics/user-data-lookup), or when an event appears in the path in a [pathfinder analysis](/docs/analytics/charts/journeys/journeys-understand-paths).
