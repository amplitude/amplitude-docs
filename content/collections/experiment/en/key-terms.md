| Assignment Event                              | Another name for Enrollment event.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Audience                                      | A group of users targeted for the experiment.

| Baseline conversion rate                      | The current rate of your primary success metrics before this experiment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Bonferroni correction                         | A statistical technique used to counteract the multiple comparisons problem (also known as multiplicity or the look-elsewhere effect).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Confidence interval                           | A range of plausible values that contains the parameter of interest. The true parameter to estimate is the difference in means between the treatment and control/baseline. For example: if the confidence level is set to 95 and the same experiment runs 100 times, the confidence interval–in each run–would contain the true parameter at least 95 times. |
| Confidence / significance level               | The probability of a false positive. For example, if you have a 95% confidence level, there is a 5% chance of detecting a change to your success metric when there was no actual change.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Enrollment Event                           | The specific event of converting users or customers into registered participants or members. |
| Exposure Event                                | The event that indicates when a user has actually seen a change based on a experiment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Guardrail metric                                | A metric you want to ensure doesn't suffer at the expense of increasing your success metrics. For example, if you drive users to a free trial of your business product, trials of your consumer product could be a counter metric. If business trials go up, consumer trials go down. You want to make sure there's a net positive effect.                                  |
| CUPED                                         | Controlled-experiment using pre-existing data (CUPED) is an optional statistical technique meant to reduce variance in experimentation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Primary success metric                        | The main metric you hope to move by running this experiment. Ideally drives both customer and business success.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Primary metric                         | A quantitative measure used to evaluate the performance, quality, and effectiveness of a recommendation system. THe primary metric determines whether your hypothesis is accepted or rejected. Therefore, it helps you understand whether your experiment has succeeded or failed.
                                                                    |
| Run time                                      | Based on the sample size needed per variant and your traffic levels, how long your experiment takes to run.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Type 1 error                                  | Incorrectly classifying that there is a statistically significant difference between treatment and control, when there isn't.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Type 2 error                                  | Incorrectly classifying that there is no difference between treatment and control, when there is.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
