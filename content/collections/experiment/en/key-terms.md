| Allocation                                    | The percent or number of targeted users you want to get this variant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Audience                                      | A group of users targeted for the experiment. This audience is usually split evenly into “control” and “variant” groups.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Baseline conversion rate                      | The current rate of your primary success metrics prior to this experiment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Bonferroni correction                         | A statistical technique used to counteract the multiple comparisons problem (also known as multiplicity or the look-elsewhere effect).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Confidence interval                           | A range of plausible values that contains the parameter of interest. In our case, the true parameter we’re trying to estimate is the difference in means between the treatment and control/baseline. For example: if the confidence level is set to 95 and we ran the same experiment 100 times, the confidence interval–in each run–would contain the true parameter at least 95 times. |
| Confidence / significance level               | The probability of a false positive. For example, if you have a 95% confidence level, there is a 5% chance of detecting a change to your success metric when there was really no change.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Guardrail metric                                | A metric you want to ensure doesn't suffer at the expense of increasing your success metrics. For example, if you drive users to a free trial of your business product, trials of your consumer product could be a counter metric. If business trials go up, consumer trials go down. You want to make sure there's a net positive effect.                                  |
| CUPED                                         | Controlled-experiment using pre-existing data, also known as CUPED, is an optional statistical technique meant to reduce variance in experimentation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Exposure Event                                | The event that indicates when a user has actually seen a change based on a experiment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Hypothesis                                    | An assumption of the methods you could take to solve or ease the problem statement and why.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| p-value                                       | The probability of observing data as extreme as what you saw or more assuming that there is no difference between treatment and control.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Primary success metric                        | The main metric you hope to move by running this experiment. Should ideally drive both customer and business success.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
