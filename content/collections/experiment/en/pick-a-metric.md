Take a look at the last sentence in that hypothesis statement. What do you notice about it? For one thing, it includes a specific measurement of how you expect user behavior to change—onboarding churn will decrease by 20%. This is what will determine whether your experiment is a success: either you’ll hit this number, or you won’t.

But how will you know? You need a way to measure that decrease in churn. To do that, you’ll need a **metric**. In Amplitude Experiment, any event you log in Amplitude Analytics can serve as an experiment metric. For the example experiment described above, you’d want to use the event your product uses to track drop-off in your funnels as your metric.
