Now that you’ve got your variants, you’ll need to decide how many of your users will see them. You can choose to roll your experiment out to your entire user base, or you can just roll it out to a fraction of them instead. You’ll specify how many users in your experiment will see the control experience and how many will see your variants. You can define specific user segments to include or exclude from your experiment, and you can even choose a specific experience for individual user or device IDs.
