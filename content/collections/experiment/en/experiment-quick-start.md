Amplitude Experiment is a workflow-driven behavioral experimentation platform that accelerates the process of creating different variants of features and websites for experimentation.

With Experiment, you can modify and configure product experiences for unique audiences through:

* **Product experimentation**: running experiments and A/B tests to onboard new users, reduce friction for checkout experiences, roll out new features, and more.
* **Progressive feature delivery:** Pre-plan and stage new features for beta testers, a percentage of your users, or even specific target audiences.
* **Dynamic in-product experiences:** Deploy and adapt custom experiences at scale.

Amplitude Experiment enables experimentation through feature flags. Feature flags are switches that let you modify your product's experience without having to change code. Experiment and feature flags use the [Amplitude Experiment SDK](/docs/sdks/experiment-sdks) or [REST API](/docs/apis/experiment) to communicate with Amplitude Experiment.

This quick start guide takes you through:
- SDK and deploymnet setu
- Creating feature flags
- Creating variations and sending payloads
- Designing experiments

## Prerequisites
Before you can begin using experiments, you must first:
- Ensure the Experiment feature is enabled on your account. 
- Ensure you have developer access to the application where you'll integrate your feature flags.
- Ensure the [Experiment SDK] (/docs/sdks/experiment-sdks) is installed.
