Out-of-the-box (OOTB) widgets are tools that let you create your web experiments with a minimum of styling or set up. By reducing the time and effort to set up an experiment, you can implement your experiments faster and with more frequency. OOTB widgets maintain brand consistency through saved design presets or auto applied styling. OOTB widgets enable you to test site elements without engineers and without affecting the underlying code of the website. 

OOTB widgets are available through the Visual Editor for Web Experiment. For more information on the Visual Editor and setting up a web experiment, go to [The Visual Editor](/docs/web-experiment/set-up-a-web-experiment#the-visual-editor). 

OOTB widgets also incorporates Amplitude AI to let you design your web experiment through conversational prompts instead of needing the precise details of your brand style guide. 

The OOTB widgets library includes:
- **Buttons**: A call to action (CTA) button. CTA buttons are just a button that can be placed anywhere on the page. When the customer click a CTA button, an action occurs for them. Actions can be taking the customer to another location of your website, like their shopping cart, or taking them to your support agents.
- **Banner**: A notification or messaging bar. Message banners can appear at the top or bottom of a page and typically announce important information to your customer. These messages can announce expected disruptions in service, highlight sales, or any other communication you want to make.
- **Banner with a button**: A notification or messaging message that also includes a CTA button. This widget combines both a CTA button as well as messaging. Typically, banners with buttons announce a specific action you want your customers to perform. For example, applying a promo code to a shopping cart. 
- **Modal pop-up**: A pop-up modal that appears on your page after a specified amount of time. Modals typically also include CTA buttons and messaging. A pop-up modal typically appear in the center of a page after a few seconds and encourages your customers to take an action. For example, encouraging new users to sign up for an account. 

You can also save your customized widgets to the library for future use. For example, if you create a notification banner that announces a quarterly sale, you can save that customized message so that it can be reused as needed. All saved widgets are available to everyone in your organization who have permission to create experiments.

Key integrations are tracked by default. You don't need to set up additional tagging for OOTB widgets for basic analysis.

## Editing widgets

By default, you can edit the following aspects of any widget:
- Text
- Button label
- Background color
- Font

All changes are visible in real-time through the Visual Editor

### AI styling
When you click the AI styler button, it automatically matches your widget with the style settings from your website. It also creates text for your buttons or other text areas. You can further edit AI-created styles if you want.
