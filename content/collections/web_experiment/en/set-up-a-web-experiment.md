Amplitude **Web Experiment** lets you create an A/B or multi-armed bandit experiment **without new code**. Open your site in the [Visual Editor](#the-visual-editor), choose the elements you’d like to experiment with, and make changes to their content or properties directly. This allows for less-technical users to easily create experiments without engineering resources.

## Before you begin

Before setting up a web experiment, you **must** [implement](/docs/experiment/web/implementation) the Web Experiment script on your site.

Keep in mind that creating and running a web experiment is different than in feature experiment, though there is some overlap.

## Set up a web experiment

To set up a web experiment, follow these steps:

1. In Amplitude Experiment, navigate to *Experiments > Create Experiment > Web Experiment*.
2. In the *New Experiment* modal, give your experiment a name. Enter the URL for a page this experiment targets—Amplitude must be instrumented on that page—and select the appropriate project from the drop-down.
3. If the script is present on the page you specified, Amplitude Experiment will open the page in the [Visual Editor](#the-visual-editor), as a new variant in your experiment.

     You have two options for the treatment variant action: [element changes](/docs/experiment/web/actions#element-changes) or [URL redirect](/docs/experiment/web/actions#url-redirect). Lets assume we're changing elements.

If the script isn’t present on the page you specified, Amplitude Experiment can’t open the Visual Editor, and will instead open the Site Setup panel and prompt you to [implement](/docs/experiment/web/implementation) the script.

4. To change text, colors, or other elements of the page’s UI, click *Element Changes*.
5. Click the element you want to change.
6. The element’s editing panel opens on the right-hand side. Edit the element’s display mode, visibility, text, background, color, or size here. Then click *Apply*.

7. Repeat this process for each element you want to change for your experiment.
8. If needed, click *+* to add another variant.
9. When you’re done, click *Continue*.
10. Next, [define your experiment’s goals](https://amplitude.com/docs/experiment/workflow/define-goals).
11. In the *Pages* tab, edit the rules to [target additional pages](/docs/experiment/web/targeting#page-targeting) for this experiment. If you're only targeting the page you originally set on creation, you can skip this step. From the *Include pages where* dropdown, specify how you want Amplitude Experiment to identify these pages.

12. Next, target the users you want to include in this experiment. If you're familiar with feature experiment targeting, Web Experiment [audience targeting](/docs/experiment/web/targeting#audience-targeting) works differently.
13. The *Advanced* tab provides several [additional options](https://amplitude.com/docs/experiment/workflow/finalize-statistical-preferences) for your experiment. Note that several of the options discussed in that article are not available for Web Experiments.
14. When you’re ready, click *Save and Close* to finish creating your Web Experiment.

## The Visual Editor

The Visual Editor loads the site located at the URL specified on experiment creation and loads an overlay on top of it. Every element of your site is accessible within the Visual Editor, for you to modify in whatever ways best suit your experiment’s needs.

When you’re making modifications to your site in the Visual Editor, your actual site remains as-is until you launch the experiment. Nothing you do here will appear on your site in real time.

When you click on an element, its editing panel opens. This is where you make changes to that element. On apply, these changes are then added to the current variant.

![web-exp-5.png](/docs/output/img/workflow/web-exp-5.png)

At the top is the element’s **selector**. The selector is a unique identifier for the selected element on the current page. This is grayed out by default, but you can edit it if you need to. You may need to update the selector if you're running the experiment on multiple pages, as the selector that is generated by default is only unique for the current page. Alternatively, you could edit the selector to select and edit multiple elements.

Below the selector are the **display** and **visibility** settings. These specify how the element displays on the page. Setting *Visibility* to `Hidden` hides the element from view, but the element remains in place; the space it takes up on the page doesn’t change. Setting *Display* to `None` effectively removes the element from the page entirely.

The **text** field stores the element’s text, if any. Edit it directly in the field. You can also change the color and font size of the element’s text. You may use inline HTML tags in the text area to style plain text.

If you select an element **without** text, the field notes that the element contains inner HTML elements, and lets you edit that, if needed. Click *Edit Raw* to do so.

Finally, change the element’s **background** color, or replace the existing background with an image.

Click *Apply* to commit your changes to this variant.

You can always re-open the Visual Editor later, by clicking *Open Visual Editor* in the *Variants* tab.
