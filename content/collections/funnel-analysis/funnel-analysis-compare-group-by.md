#### This article will help you:

* Quickly compare a group-by value to that of a baseline property

Funnel charts allow you to compare a group-by property to another baseline property. Once your Funnel chart has a Segment property group-by, click the *Compare* dropdown to choose a value for comparison.

With that value selected, the conversion percentage difference will be seen on the microscope when hovering over a value in the visual, and the breakdown table. For a particular step in the breakdown table, you’ll see both the absolute percent difference and the conversion percent difference.  
  
There are some limitations to Segment property group-by comparisons:

* They are only available for Conversion and Conversion Over Time.
* They are applicable to Compare to Property Value or Compare to Past only.
* You are limited to a maximum of two Segment group-bys.
