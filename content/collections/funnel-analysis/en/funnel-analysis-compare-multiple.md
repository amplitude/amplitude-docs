In a Funnel Analysis chart, you can compare up to three events within a single conversion step. After [step 4 of building your funnel](/docs/analytics/charts/funnel-analysis/funnel-analysis-build), select *Compare Event* from the *Options* flyout menu, and then select the events to compare.

Comparing multiple events within one step is available for conversion and conversion over time metrics. Compare up to three events per step, and two steps at a time. Event comparisons are available for all three order options (any order, this order, exact order); however, they aren't available in dashboard filters, and are removed if you switch between charts or funnel metrics.
