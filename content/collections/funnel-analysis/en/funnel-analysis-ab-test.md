For best practices, including tips on instrumentation, see the [How to Analyze A/B Tests Results in Amplitude](/docs/get-started/analyze-a-b-test-results) article.

In Amplitude, A/B testing lets you compare the funnel conversion performance of two or more user segments against each other. You can view results as **improvement**, which describes the performance of a segment compared to the baselineâ€”or as **statistical significance**, which show you the probability of observing a difference as extreme as what you saw, assuming the control and treatment have the same mean.

For statistical significance calculations with continuous metrics, use the [experiment results chart](/docs/analytics/charts/experiment-results/experiment-results-dig-deeper) or the [Experiment end-to-end product](/docs/feature-experiment/overview).

### Feature availability

This feature is available to users on **Growth** and **Enterprise plans** only. See our [pricing page](https://amplitude.com/pricing) for more details.

Amplitude, by default, uses the first segment added to the funnel analysis as the baseline, but you can change this in the *Baseline segment* drop-down menu.

### A/B Test - Improvement

This chart displays the conversion rate for each segment across all steps in your funnel. You can have more than just one variant in an A/B test, but you can only have one baseline.

### A/B Test - Significance

On this chart, a high value for a variant suggests it converts better than the baseline, while a low value suggests it doesn't.

Amplitude considers the results as statistically significant if the results include:

* a sample size above 30 for both variants
* sample `size * conversion rate >= 5` **and** `sample size * (1-conversion rate) >= 5` for both variants
* a significance of 95% or greater

Get more details on [how Amplitude calculates statistical significance](/docs/faq/statistical-significance).

### Understand the breakdown table

The data table below the chart gives you a breakdown of the data. As with all data tables in Amplitude, you can export the data as a CSV file. Here are the columns included:

* **Count:** The number of users or groups that entered the funnel.
* **Converted:** The number of users or groups that completed all the steps in the funnel with all conditions met.
* **% Conversion:** The number of converted users or groups, divided by the number of users or groups that entered the funnel.
* **% Improvement over Baseline:** Amplitude calculates this by the equation `(% conversion for that variant - % conversion for the baseline) / (% conversion for the baseline)`. The percentage in the data table is green when the value is a positive number.
* **Significance:** This is the likelihood that the performance displayed for each test variant is **actually** different from zero, and not due to random fluctuations in the data. The higher this value is, the more confident you can be in your results. More formally, this is `1 - p-value`.
