  - 'Add an optional step to your Funnel Analysis charts, and compare conversion rates between the two versions'
ai_summary: 'You can define conversions with optional steps in Amplitude. By marking a step as optional, you can create two funnel views - one with the step and one without it. The conversion insights and breakdown table will reflect these scenarios. Note that there are limitations: optional steps are available for Conversion and Conversion Over Time, only one step can be optional at a time, and only middle steps can be marked as optional. Additionally, optional events cannot be reordered, have group-bys, or compare multiple events. You can also create in-line custom events in Funnel and Event Segmentation charts.'

At times you will need to define a conversion where some of the steps are optional. For example, a funnel has steps A, B, C, and D, where B is optional. If a user performs steps A, C, and D, they would still convert.

Click **More Options** in the Events side control and select *Optional step* to make a step optional.

When an event is marked optional, the side control will say *\*Optional* and have a dotted line around it.

The chart will then show two funnels - one with the step and one without the step. The conversion take-aways and breakdown table will also reflect these two scenarios.

There are some limitations to marking a step as optional:

* It is available for Conversion and Conversion Over Time only.
* Only one step can be optional at a time.
* Only middle steps can be optional. First and last steps can never be optional.
* Optional events cannot be reordered.
* Events with a group-by cannot be optional.
* Events comparing multiple events cannot be optional.

In-line custom events can also be created in Funnel and Event Segmentation charts. [Read this article for more information](/docs/analytics/charts/event-segmentation/event-segmentation-in-line-events).
