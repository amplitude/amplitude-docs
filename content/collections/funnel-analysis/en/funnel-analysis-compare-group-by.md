By selecting a value for comparison in the *Compare* dropdown, you can analyze conversion percentage differences in the visual and breakdown table. Keep in mind limitations like only being available for Conversion and Conversion Over Time, applicable to Compare to Property Value or Compare to Past, and a maximum of two Segment group-bys.'

Funnel charts allow you to compare a group-by property to another baseline property. Once your Funnel chart has a Segment property group-by, click the *Compare* dropdown to choose a value for comparison.

With that value selected, the conversion percentage difference will be seen on the microscope when hovering over a value in the visual, and the breakdown table. For a particular step in the breakdown table, youâ€™ll see both the absolute percent difference and the conversion percent difference.  
  
There are some limitations to Segment property group-by comparisons:

* They are only available for Conversion and Conversion Over Time.
* They are applicable to Compare to Property Value or Compare to Past only.
* You are limited to a maximum of two Segment group-bys.
