Amplitude Data allows you to integrate with Jira to quickly create new Jira issues whenever you make changes to a feature branch. You can only create issues from within the feature branch, and only changes can be associated with a Jira ticket.

### Feature availability

This feature is available to users on **all Amplitude plans**.

## Set up the integration

To set up and use the integration, follow these steps:

1. In Amplitude Data, navigate to *Settings > Integrations* and find the Atlassian Jira panel. Click *Add*, and in the modal that appears, click *Authenticate*Â to start the authentication flow.

2. Another modal will appear, this one asking you to authorize Jira access for your site. From the drop-down in the modal, select the site you want to authorize. Then click *Accept*.

## Create a Jira issue in Amplitude Data

To create a new Jira ticket from within Amplitude Data, follow these steps:

1. First, create a feature branch and make your changes there. You can only use this integration from within a feature branch.
2. Your changes will appear grouped by sources under the Home page. If you successfully integrate with Jira, you can create a Jira Issue for each source here inside Amplitude Data.  
  
    Click *+Jira* to create a new issue or link an existing issue to current changes.

3. To unlink an issue from your feature branch, hover over the issue tag and click *Unlink Jira*. In the modal that appears, click *Unlink* to confirm the unlink action.

Once an issue is linked to a source, any subsequent published changes will automatically leave a comment on the Jira issue.
