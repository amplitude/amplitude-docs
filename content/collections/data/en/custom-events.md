ai_summary: 'You can create custom events in Amplitude by combining two separate events with an `OR` clause to track related user activities. Custom events are available in various charts and are useful for grouping events or analyzing user behavior. Custom events are created in the Events panel and can only be accessed in specific charts. This feature is available for Plus, Growth, and Enterprise plans. Remember, only admins, managers, and members can create custom events. Custom events are labeled with the prefix `[Custom]` in your charts.'

Sometimes, you may need to create an analysis in which a particular step of the process can be any of a selection of specific events. 

You can [combine multiple events in-line](/docs/analytics/charts/event-segmentation/event-segmentation-in-line-events) through the Events Module. However, the in-line event that you create is relevant to that specific chart and isn't accessible anywhere else unless you save it as a **custom event**. Custom events consist of two separate events joined by an `OR` clause. For example, this analysis shows in users who, after receiving a push notification, either played a song **or** searched for one as their next step: 

![customEvent_funnel.png](/docs/output/img/data/customevent-funnel-png.png)

You create a custom event in the *Events* panel from one or more pre-existing events. Doing so tells Amplitude to combine for those pre-existing events and count any user activity for them as activity for the new custom event. This is useful if you want an easy way to track activity on related or similar events, like whether a visitor has fired either the `view_landing_page_1` or `view_landing_page_2` events.

In the image above, `Play or Search Song` is a custom event consisting of the `Play Song` event, the `Search Song` event, and an `OR` clause to connect the two. Any user who triggers either the `Play Song` event **or** the `Search Song` event has converted that second step.

Another method is conditioning an added event with an [event property or user property](/docs/data/user-properties-and-events). This is the primary method for analyzing if a user had performed one of many events.

### Feature availability

This feature is available to users on **Plus**, **Growth**, and **Enterprise** **plans** only.

## Before you begin

* Only admins, managers, and members can create custom events.
* Custom events are available only in the Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Impact Analysis, Pathfinder, Experiment Results, and Compass charts.
* You can't query on custom events in Redshift.
* All custom events have the prefix `[Custom]` before the event name in your charts.
* Editing or renaming custom events used in other charts break those charts. Amplitude continues to query the named value until you manually change it on any charts that use it. Amplitude displays a warning when making any edits to custom events.
* Querying event properties on custom events is possible only if the property applies to all events. If you try to create a custom event with five different events, and you want to see the location values from all those events, you need to instrument the location event property to all the individual events making up the custom event.

## Group two existing events into a single custom event

To do this, follow these steps:

1. In Amplitude Data’s left-hand rail, click *Events*. Then click *Create Custom Event*.

2. In the modal that appears, select the events you want to analyze as a single event. There is an option to set different filters on these events, in case the analysis requires a more granular view of the selected events.

![create_customEvent.png](/docs/output/img/data/create-customevent-png.png)

At this point, this event is available for further analyses in Amplitude. To use it, select the new event in the *Custom* category in the appropriate chart drop-down menus.
