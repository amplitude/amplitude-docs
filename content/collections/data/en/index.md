To get the most out of Amplitude, building a data catalog your team understands and trusts is critical. Amplitude Data provides governance tools to help you define, track, verify, and improve your data across the platform.

## Planning and instrumentation

Amplitude Data provides a robust set of tools to help prevent data quality issues from the start.

* Create a plan directly in Amplitude and define your events, properties, and even your taxonomy standards directly in Amplitude. Analytics users will see this information when selecting events and properties, and we'll also monitor to make sure your incoming data matches your spec.
* Use the Ampli developer toolkit, which uses your plan to generate a type-safe tracking library and lints code to ensure proper tracking of your events and properties.

Planning directly in Amplitude Data means you'll always have an up-to-date plan your company can use instead of one-off spreadsheets or wiki pages that can quickly become outdated. We've created a walkthrough of the [complete planning workflow](/docs/data/data-planning-workflow) to illustrate the process from start to finish.

## Data management

For data that's been ingested, Amplitude Data also provides a robust set of Data Management tools.

* Improve data discoverability by enriching the metadata on your events and properties. Ensure your company has a shared definition and understanding of all your tracking.
* Clean up your data with tools to transform existing events and properties, drop incorrect data from your queries, and block or delete data you no longer want to collect.
* Enrich your data by leveraging your existing events and properties to create new custom events, map existing properties to values with lookup properties, and generate new derived properties based on formulas.
* Monitor your data with observability, which monitors your incoming data and compares it to your plan in real-time.

To help you along the way, we've also created Data Assistant to provide intelligent recommendations and automation to make it even easier and faster to improve your data quality.
