Benefits include enriching data, bulk changing property values, and filtering lists. Lookup Tables must not exceed 100MB or 1 million rows. To create one, you need a property to map from and a .CSV file. Exact matches are case-sensitive. Admin or Manager rights are needed to manage sources. You can update a lookup table by editing its configuration and delete unnecessary tables by following simple steps in Amplitude."

With Amplitude's Lookup Table feature, you can import your own data and map it to ingested properties to create an enhanced set of event and user properties.

### Feature availability

This feature is available to users on **Growth** or **Enterprise** plans.

## Lookup table benefits

* **Enrich data using ingested property values**. Say you've captured an event called `Purchased` with an event property named `SKU`. The `SKU` value itself doesn’t inherently hold a lot of meaning. But with your list of all the SKUs and their corresponding product names, you can use this feature to create a new property called `Product Name` and have it automatically populate based on that list.
* **Bulk change or fix property values.** Imagine you've captured a user property called `Language Code` and passed in language codes (`en_US`, `fr_FR`, `de_DE`, etc.). This is difficult to read, so you want a `Language` property that maps to friendlier values like `English`, `French`, and `German`. Use this feature to create a new property called `Language` that maps the language codes to the language names.
* **Bulk filter long lists**. You want to see user behavior for a specific region and you have a list of all the customers and their regions. Use this to map each customer to a region, creating a new `Region` property. Now you can filter specifically to each region in a chart.

Lookup Tables may not exceed 100MB or 1 million rows. Contact your Amplitude CSM if you have data that exceeds this limit.

## Create a Lookup Table

Before you can get started using Lookup Tables, you’ll need:

* An event property or user property to create a mapping from, and
* A .CSV that has the data you want to map to. The first column data must correspond to the mapping property value and must contain unique values.

{{partial:admonition type="note" heading=""}}
Lookup Tables are looking for exact matches, and are **case-sensitive**.

To create a new Lookup Table in Amplitude Data, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to *Sources* in the project you want to import the .CSV data to.
2. Click *+ Add Source*. Search for *CSV*, then click it.
3. Navigate to your .CSV file and upload it. Then click *Next*.
4. Map your event property by selecting it from the dropdown. When you're done, click *Finish*.

## Update a Lookup Table

If you want to create a new lookup property or fix an incorrectly mapped property, you can update the lookup table by following these steps:

1. In Amplitude, navigate to *Sources*, find the Lookup Table in the *Sources List*. Click on it to open its *General* tab.
2. Open the *Edit Lookup Table Configuration* tab.
3. Make your changes. You can change the mapping, or replace the .CSV by uploading a new file.
4. When you’re finished, click *Update your lookup table configuration*.

## Delete a Lookup Table and its properties

To delete a Lookup Table you no longer need, follow these steps:

1. In Amplitude, navigate to *Sources*, then find the Lookup Table in the *Sources List*.
2. Open the *Edit Lookup Table Configuration* tab.
3. Click the trash can and follow the on-screen instructions.
