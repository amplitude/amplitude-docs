Currency conversion lets you analyze multi-currency revenue data in Amplitude. With currency conversion, you can:
- Send Amplitude transaction data with local currency codes.
- Use revenue data for insight generation or decision making without first needing to manually pre-convert data into a single currency.
- Run queries based on a series of lookup tables connected to daily exchange rates to convert transaction amounts based on transaction dates and daily exchange rates. You can use the primary currency set at the project level (for example, convert all global currencies to USD).
