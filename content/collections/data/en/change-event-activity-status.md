ai_summary: 'You can specify whether an event in Amplitude is active or inactive. Active events are those users engage with, like clicking a button, while inactive events are passive, like notifications. Changing an event to inactive removes it from active user metrics but still counts in new user definitions. Changes apply immediately and retroactively. Follow steps to update event status. This functionality only applies to active events in your tracking plan and not custom events. You can also update the status from the Events table or Details flyout.'

You can specify whether Amplitude should consider an event to be **active** or **inactive**. A good way to think about the difference is that an active event is one the user actively engaged with, like clicking the Add to Cart button. An **inactive** event is one that happened to the user, without any specific action on their part. Some good examples of this would be events like `Push Notification Sent` or `Message Received`.

Setting an event as inactive removes that event from any dashboard metrics counting active users and active events. Users who only trigger inactive events **aren't counted** as active users for that day, though they **do** count towards Amplitude’s new user definitions.

When you change an event's activity status from active to inactive, Amplitude applies that change **immediately and retroactively**, so you should expect to see changes in your historical data. Inactive events still count against your event volume.

To change the activity status, follow these steps:

1. Click the checkbox next to the event name. You can select more than one event if you want to change the status of multiple events at once.
2. Click the *Edit Activity* drop-down menu.
3. Select the new event status.

This only applies to **active** events and event properties that are **included in your tracking plan**. It also **doesn't** apply to custom events.

You can also update the Activity status from the *Activity* column in the *Events* table, or the *Details* flyout of a specific event. From the *Events* table, change the status from the *Activity* column's drop-down menu. Click on an event's name to access the *Details* flyout, and change the *Activity* status from the drop-down menu.
