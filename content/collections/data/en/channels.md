ai_summary: "Amplitude's channels feature lets you define acquisition channels based on UTM and referrer data. You can create new properties retroactively without affecting raw data. Different plans offer different capabilities for creating classifiers. Admins or Managers can create channels by defining channel properties and values. Data Tables enable you to compare metrics between channels. Use cases include blended views, high-level channels, channels with campaigns, and attribution evaluation. Special values like ANY, (none), and blank capture specific property values."

Marketers often want to define their acquisition channels based on [UTM](/docs/get-started/analyze-acquisition-channels) and referrer data. Amplitude’s **channels** allow you to create new properties retroactively, based on functions and operators you can apply across multiple existing properties. These don't affect your raw data and Amplitude computes them on the fly.

For example, you may want to understand the distribution of organic traffic to your site. Define a version of your channels that includes the known social and search domains at that time. When a new social or search channel becomes prevalent, you can update your organic search definition and your existing charts update **retroactively** to reflect the new definition.

### Feature availability

* Starter and Plus plans can create one classifier.
* Growth and Enterprise plans can create unlimited classifiers.

## Create a channel

You must be an Admin or Manager to create a channel.

To create a channel, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the *Properties* section of Amplitude Data and open the *Channels* tab.
2. Click *+ Add Channel Classifier.* A pre-built, default channel definition screen opens. Optionally, click the default channel title (*Channel*) to edit the name. You can also add a description below it, if you like.
3. To begin creating the definition of the channel, start from the default template or click *Clear Table* to clear the table's contents.  
      
    You can add multiple properties to a row to create a more complex classifier.

    Amplitude recommends using user properties rather than event properties for channels because Amplitude applies user properties to future events that a user triggers. For more information, see [About user properties and event properties](/docs/data/user-properties-and-events#how-amplitude-updates-user-properties).

4. Add one row for each channel you would like to define. For example, you can add rows labeled `Paid`, `Organic`, `Referral`, and `Direct` to create a high-level channel definition.
5. Fill the values for each row. Each cell must evaluate to `True` for an event to classify to that channel.

    If a channel could be defined as `row A OR row B`, you can add one row for A and one row for B, and then set the channel name to be the same for both rows.

6. Click *Save*. Amplitude labels channels in property dropdowns under the *Channels* category.

## Compare metrics between channels with Data Tables

Amplitude’s [Data Tables](/docs/analytics/charts/data-tables/data-tables-multi-dimensional-analysis) allow you to define metrics critical to your bottom line, such as CPA, AOV, and ROAS. Evaluate how these metrics perform between different channels by **grouping by your channel** on the left-hand column. To see how these channels break down further, add other core dimensions like campaigns.

Amplitude attributes metrics in different ways if a user has multiple touch points with different channels before converting. Amplitude has built [attribution modeling](/docs/analytics/charts/data-tables/data-tables-attribute-credit) into data tables to enable defining user attribution in your channels.

{{partial:admonition type="tip" heading=""}}
Applying a channel classifier before an attribution model can attribute values in potentially unexpected ways. For example, in a sequence consisting of:  
  
`CPC --> email --> website`  
  
Applying a channel classifier of `CPC only` results in `email` and `website` being filtered out. In this case, the attribution model would attribute to CPC.

## Use cases

* **Blended views:** Easily create top level blended views of all paid and all organic traffic to easily see how efficiency and performance have changed over time.
* **High-level channels:** Break down your core metrics according to the common definitions of channels you already use in [Google Analytics](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6010097?hl=en#zippy=%2Cin-this-article) and [Adobe](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/analytics/components/marketing-channels/c-getting-started-mchannel.html?lang=en).
* **Channels with campaigns:** Add a property denoting a campaign as a column in your channel definitions, to break down metrics by campaign channels.
* **Attribution:** Use channels in conjunction with attribution models in data tables to evaluate the breakdown of a metric by first, last, or a custom attribution definition.

## Special values

Amplitude evaluates these special values on events:

| **Value** | **Description**                                                                                           |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ANY       | Captures explicitly set `none` values, or any other value that's set on the property.                     |
| (none)    | Captures both explicitly and implicitly set `none` values.                                                |
| blank     | Captures both explicitly and implicitly set `none` values, or any other value that's set on the property. |

{{partial:admonition type="note" heading="Explicitly vs. implicitly set `nones`"}}
`None` values set both explicitly and implicitly appear as `none` in any Analytics chart. 

Explicitly set `none` values appear when Amplitude receives the property with a value of `null`.

Implicitly set `none` values appear when Amplitude receives a property with no value.
