ai_summary: "In Amplitude Data, you can manage event types, event properties, and user properties. You have the ability to import and export your schema with .CSV files, make bulk changes, and update descriptions and categories. You can follow specific steps to import or export events and event properties, as well as user properties. The .CSV file structure for both types of properties is detailed, including required fields and values. By utilizing the import and export features, you can efficiently handle and update your tracking plan's schema in Amplitude."

In Amplitude Data, you can view and manage event types, event properties, and user properties piece by piece, but you may want to see a holistic view of your entire tracking plan's schema and make bulk changes to the schema instead.

Amplitude lets you import and export your schema with .CSV to plan new events and properties, edit categories and descriptions, and generate bulk changes.

This article covers the differences between using import and export for events and event properties versus user properties.

## Events and event properties

Follow the below steps to import or export events and event properties:

1. Navigate to Data, and click *Events* under your tracking plan in the left side pane.
2. If you wish to import, click the import icon to open the import modal.
3. If your import file is ready to upload and follows the [expected schema for events and event properties](#events-and-event-properties-file-schema), you can drop your .CSV file or click *Upload* and choose the file from your desired location. If not, click *template* to download a template .CSV to update for importing.

    ![](/docs/output/img/data/22418776497947.png)

    The imported events and event properties appear in a branch named *import*.

4. Once you’re sure the imported tracking plan updates are correct, you can [merge the changes back into the main branch](/docs/data/data-planning-workflow).
5. If you want to export events and event properties from your tracking plan, click the export icon instead.
6. In the export modal that appears, choose whether to download your tracking plan’s schema or a .CSV file template. Then, click *Download*.

Downloaded .CSV files of your tracking plan contain additional fields not required for import. The next section defines the events and event properties .CSV import file structure and the [additional columns seen in the exported file](#events-and-event-properties-file-schema).

The import and export features don't support custom events, transformations, nor default Amplitude entities.

## Events and event properties file schema

The events and event properties .CSV file requires a specific schema for a successful import. The table below highlights the required schema by entity type. There are some things to note: 

* The file's header must contain all listed fields.

Removing an event or property group disassociates related properties, and changes a live property’s status to unexpected. The remove value doesn't delete an entity, nor does it stop ingestion.
