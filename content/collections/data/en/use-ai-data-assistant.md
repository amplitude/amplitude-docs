Maintaining a clean and organized tracking plan is key to maximizing the value you get from Amplitude Data. But when you have hundreds or even thousands of events and properties, doing so can be a daunting task. This is particularly true for identifying what needs to be done to improve messy data.

Amplitude’s AI Data Assistant helps you stay on top of your tracking plan by showing you a short list of suggested modifications whenever you are on the Data home page. These suggestions are generated automatically, by Amplitude’s internal AI. Any changes you make via the Data Assistant will be posted directly to your tracking plan, with no other action required on your part.

### Feature availability

This feature is available to users on **all Amplitude plans**.

## Update your tracking plan with Data Assistant

To update your tracking plan using the Data Assistant, follow these steps:

1. Open Amplitude Data. You’ll see the Data Assistant at the top of the home page, displaying a list of its top suggestions.

These suggestions are listed in order of priority, which Data Assistant determines by looking at event volume and query counts, among other things.

2. Select a specific suggestion to review (by clicking *Review*), or review all suggestions by clicking (*Review All*). This will open the Assistant page.
3. In the left-hand sidebar is a list of all suggested modifications for your tracking plan. Click any suggestion to see a list of the events the suggestion would affect.

Data Assistant groups suggestions with others similar to them, as a way to prioritize the most important issues and make the entire process of updating the tracking plan as easy as possible.  
  
If you’d like more detail on why Data Assistant has made a specific suggestion, hover over the Info icon.

You can choose to implement the offered suggestion for all, some, or none of the events listed. To implement all of them, click *Apply All*. To implement none of them, click *Reject All*.  
  
To implement (or reject) the suggestion for only certain events, check the boxes for those events and click *Apply Suggestions* (or *Reject Suggestions*), or simply click *Apply* (or *X*) next to each of the events you want to update.
