[Shopify](https://www.shopify.com/) is an all-in-one commerce platform that allows businesses of any size to create, customize, and manage online stores with ease. It offers tools for product listings, payments, shipping, and customer engagement, streamlining the selling process online, across social media, and in person.

The [Amplitude Shopify Plugin](https://apps.shopify.com/amplitude) enables you to bring data from your Shopify store into Amplitude, unlocking valuable insights from funnel analytics, user behavior trends and charts, ROI analysis, Session Replay and more.

## Overview

The Shopify plugin installs a version of the [Amplitude Browser SDK](/docs/sdks/analytics/browser/browser-sdk-2) and adds the script before the `</head>` tag of your site's pages. The script includes [Session Replay](/docs/session-replay) and [Web Experiment](/docs/web-experiment).

{{partial:admonition type="warning" heading="Shopify and flickering"}}
The method Shopify uses to loads Amplitude's Shopify app causes flickering. To avoid this, add the [asynchronous web script with the anti-flicker snippet](#async-script-with-anti-flicker-snippet) to your `theme.liquid` file.
{{/partial:admonition}}

The Shopify plugin captures Amplitude's default events, including [marketing attribution](/docs/sdks/analytics/browser/browser-sdk-2#track-marketing-attribution) and Shopify's standard [events](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/web-pixels-api/standard-events).

{{/partial:collapse}}

In most scenarios, when a customer completes the checkout flow, Shopify fires the Checkout complete event, then the Order created event. If you create an order manually from your store's Admin page, only the Order created event fires. The Checkout complete event is specific to a customer completing the checkout flow.

User ID is set using the email address or phone number the customer enters in the Contact section of the checkout.

{{partial:admonition type="note" heading="Shopify checkout page"}}
Shopify prevents third-party packages from loading on your store's checkout page. As a result, Amplitude doesn't receive events from the checkout page, and you can't run experiments on it.
