You can update an event type's category directly from the _Events_, _Custom Events_, or _Labeled Events_ tab. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Go to the _Events_ page and select the _Events_, _Custom Events_, or _Labeled Events_ tab.
1. Click the checkbox next to the event name.
1. From the _Categorize_ drop-down, select the category to which this event should belong.

For events within _Events_, this only applies to **active** events that are **included in your tracking plan**.

You can also change the event's category from the *Category* column in the *Events*, _Custom Events_, or *Labeled Events* tables or from inside its right-hand fly-out panel. From a table, change the status from the *Category* column's drop-down menu. Click the event name to open its _Details_ panel, then navigate to _Category_ and select the new category from the drop-down menu.
