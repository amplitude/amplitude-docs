You can also change the event's category from the *Category* column in the *Events*, _Custom Events_, or *Labeled Events* tables or from inside its right-hand fly-out panel. From a table, change the status from the *Category* column's drop-down menu. Click the event name to open its _Details_ panel, then navigate to _Category_ and select the new category from the drop-down menu.
