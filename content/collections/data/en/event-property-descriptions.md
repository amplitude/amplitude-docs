You can change the description for an **event** or **property** to help other members of your organization understand what an event or property represents. 

{{partial:admonition type="note" heading=""}}
This only applies to **active** events and properties that are **included in your tracking plan**. It also **doesn't** apply to custom events.

## Add a description to an event

To add a description to an event, follow these steps:

1. Go to *Events* and click on the name of the event you want to add a description to.
2. In the flyout that appears, click *Add a description* (under *Details*).
3. Type in a description of the event and click *Apply*.

## Add a description to an event property

You can change the description for an **event property** in two different ways. Since the same event property can apply to multiple event types, you have the option to add a description for the **global** event property as well as for the **specific** event to event property pair. If the event property description that's specific to an event doesn't exist, then the description defaults to the global event property description.

* To change the description for an event property **specific** to an event, navigate to *Events* and click on the event name to open the *Details* panel. Then type a description where it says *Add a description*, and click *Apply* to save.
* To change the **global** description for an event property, navigate to *Properties > Event Properties* and click on the event property name to open the *Details* panel. Then type a description where it says *Add a description*, and click *Apply* to save.

## Add a description to a user or group property

You can change the description for a **user property** or a **group property** by navigating to *Properties > User Properties* or *Properties > Group Properties*. Click on the property name to open the *Details* panel. Then type a description where it says *Add a description*, and click *Apply* to save.
