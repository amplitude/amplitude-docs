ai_summary: 'You can add descriptions to events, event properties, user properties, and group properties in Amplitude. This helps your organization understand what each represents. Descriptions are only for active events and properties in your tracking plan, excluding custom events. To add a description, go to the specific event or property, type in a description, and click Apply to save. For event properties, you can have global descriptions or specific descriptions for individual events. Simply navigate to the event or property, add a description, and save it.'

You can change the description for an **event** or **property** to help other members of your organization understand what an event or property represents. 

{{partial:admonition type="note" heading=""}}
This only applies to **active** events and properties that are **included in your tracking plan**. It also **doesn't** apply to custom events.

## Add a description to an event

To add a description to an event, follow these steps:

1. Go to *Events* and click on the name of the event you want to add a description to.
2. In the flyout that appears, click *Add a description* (under *Details*).
3. Type in a description of the event and click *Apply*.

## Add a description to an event property

You can change the description for an **event property** in two different ways. Since the same event property can apply to multiple event types, you have the option to add a description for the **global** event property as well as for the **specific** event to event property pair. If the event property description that's specific to an event doesn't exist, then the description defaults to the global event property description.

* To change the description for an event property **specific** to an event, navigate to *Events* and click on the event name to open the *Details* panel. Then type a description where it says *Add a description*, and click *Apply* to save.
* To change the **global** description for an event property, navigate to *Properties > Event Properties* and click on the event property name to open the *Details* panel. Then type a description where it says *Add a description*, and click *Apply* to save.

## Add a description to a user or group property

You can change the description for a **user property** or a **group property** by navigating to *Properties > User Properties* or *Properties > Group Properties*. Click on the property name to open the *Details* panel. Then type a description where it says *Add a description*, and click *Apply* to save.
