source: 'https://help.amplitude.com/hc/en-us/articles/17050416767003-Change-the-description-of-an-event-or-property'
ai_summary: 'You can change event and event property descriptions in Amplitude to help your team understand them better. For events, click the event name, then the *Description* field, and type in a description. For event properties, you can add descriptions for the original property or an overridden one. To change an overridden event property specific to an event, click the event name, go to *Details > Properties*, and update the property description. To change the original event property description, go to *Event Properties* and update the description there.'

You can change the description for an **event** to help other members of your organization understand what an event represents. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Click the event name to open the fly-out panel on the right side.
2. Click the *Description* field.
3. Type in a description of the event.

You can change the description for an **event property** in two different ways. Since the same event property can apply to multiple event types, you can either add a description for the **original** event property, or for an event property that has been overridden for a specific event or property group. (If the latter doesn’t exist, the description will default to the global event property.)

Event properties that aren't overridden share the same **original** event property details.

To change the description for an overridden event property **specific to an event**, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the *Events* table and click the event name.
2. In the event details panel that opens, navigate to *Details > Properties*, and click the property you want to update.
3. Make sure the event property is overridden. If it is, *Manage Override* will be visible in the blue box within the details panel, and you can skip to step 4. Otherwise, click *Override* to apply the change only to a specific event or property group.
4. Click the field directly below the property name and type in a description of the property.

To change the **original** description for an event property, follow these steps: 

1. Navigate to *Event Properties* and click the property you want to update.
2. In the event property details panel that opens, click the field and type in a description of the property.
