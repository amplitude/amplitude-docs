You can change the description for an **event** to help other members of your organization understand what an event represents. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Click the event name to open the fly-out panel on the right side.
2. Click the *Description* field.
3. Type in a description of the event.

You can change the description for an **event property** in two different ways. Since the same event property can apply to multiple event types, you can either add a description for the **original** event property, or for an event property that has been overridden for a specific event or property group. (If the latter doesn’t exist, the description will default to the global event property.)

Event properties that aren't overridden share the same **original** event property details.

To change the description for an overridden event property **specific to an event**, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the *Events* table and click the event name.
2. In the event details panel that opens, navigate to *Details > Properties*, and click the property you want to update.
3. Make sure the event property is overridden. If it is, *Manage Override* will be visible in the blue box within the details panel, and you can skip to step 4. Otherwise, click *Override* to apply the change only to a specific event or property group.
4. Click the field directly below the property name and type in a description of the property.

To change the **original** description for an event property, follow these steps: 

1. Navigate to *Event Properties* and click the property you want to update.
2. In the event property details panel that opens, click the field and type in a description of the property.
