Choosing Between Feature Experiments and Web Experiments with Amplitude: A Guide

In today’s data-driven landscape, teams rely on experimentation to optimize product features and enhance user experiences. Amplitude offers two powerful tools for this purpose: Feature Experiments and Web Experiments. Both support A/B testing and product performance evaluation, but they serve different purposes. Understanding how they differ helps you select the best approach for your testing goals.

What Are Feature Experiments and Web Experiments?
Feature Experiments allow teams to test specific product features, typically through backend mechanisms like feature flags. These experiments let you deploy and compare different feature variations, measuring their impact on metrics such as engagement and conversion. They give you tight control over how features behave and who experiences them.

Web Experiments focus on frontend changes—such as UI/UX tweaks, design variations, or content updates on webpages. Teams use them to A/B test layout changes, aiming to improve interaction and engagement on websites or web apps.

While both tools provide valuable insights, each fits a different type of experimentation. Here’s how to decide which one to use.

1. Gain Granular Control Over Features
Feature Experiments give you detailed control over how and when users experience specific features. You can toggle features on or off for targeted groups using feature flags, isolating their impact more precisely.

For example, when testing a new payment option, you can activate it only for a specific user segment. This setup ensures you measure its effect on conversion rates without altering the entire user experience. In contrast, Web Experiments apply broader UI changes—like button color or layout tweaks—without the same degree of targeting.

2. Target Specific User Segments
Feature Experiments let you define and test with highly specific user segments, based on behavioral data, demographics, or user lifecycle stages. This targeting provides more accurate and meaningful results.

Say you want to introduce a new feature to your most active users or new signups—Feature Experiments make it easy to control who sees what. While Web Experiments offer some segmentation, they generally target larger audiences and offer less precision for complex scenarios.

3. Improve Performance
Because Feature Experiments operate server-side, they typically consume fewer client-side resources. This backend-driven approach leads to faster load times and smoother user experiences.

Web Experiments often inject scripts or manipulate frontend elements in real-time, which can slow down performance—especially on content-heavy or dynamic pages. For large-scale or complex tests, Feature Experiments deliver greater efficiency and scalability.

4. Support Sophisticated Experimentation
When you need to test backend systems, APIs, or changes in logic flow, Feature Experiments provide the necessary depth. They let you control which feature variations users see and enable detailed testing of server-side elements.

For instance, if you’re evaluating how a new recommendation engine influences user engagement, you can run controlled tests with different backend algorithms. Web Experiments, by contrast, are better suited to testing UI adjustments or page layouts, and don't support deeper backend experimentation.

5. Enable Long-Term Feature Testing
Feature Experiments work well for long-term testing and gradual rollouts. You can toggle features on or off for specific segments over time, using feedback and metrics to iterate.

If you're launching a new feature in stages, Feature Experiments allow you to monitor results continuously and adjust the rollout accordingly. Web Experiments, on the other hand, typically focus on short-term UI tests and are quicker to set up but less suitable for extended testing.

6. Integrate Seamlessly with Backend Systems
Feature Experiments integrate directly with backend logic, making them ideal for testing features like API changes, server-side calculations, or personalized services. You can run backend tests without altering the user interface.

For example, you might want to compare multiple versions of a payment processor without changing the frontend. Feature Experiments let you run these backend tests easily. Web Experiments focus on frontend changes and aren't designed to handle backend complexity.

7. Maintain Consistency Across Platforms
If your product spans web, mobile, and desktop, Feature Experiments help you ensure consistent testing across all platforms. By managing feature flags server-side, you can deliver the same experience to users regardless of the device.

This consistency is crucial when testing product-wide features. Web Experiments generally target web interfaces and may require separate implementations for other platforms.

#Conclusion: Which Should You Choose?

Use Feature Experiments when you need to:

- Test backend logic or APIs

- Run long-term or iterative experiments

- Control who sees specific features

- Ensure consistency across platforms

- Optimize performance and scalability

Choose Web Experiments when you want to:

- Test frontend UI or design changes

- Quickly implement A/B tests

- Focus on user interface improvements

- Run short-term experiments
