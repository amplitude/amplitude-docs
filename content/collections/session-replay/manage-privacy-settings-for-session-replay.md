For many organizations, data privacy, security, and PII are more pressing concerns than they’ve ever been before. Because the potential for legal exposure varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and because specific business needs vary considerably, no one-size-fits-all solution will work for everyone.

This is why Amplitude’s Session Replay feature enables you to specify the types of user data displayed during a replay. These privacy settings are flexible enough to adhere to your company’s legal and security requirements, no matter what they are. Once they’re set, you can enjoy the peace of mind that comes with knowing that nothing will inadvertently fall through the cracks.

When these privacy settings are activated, the user data you specify will be **masked** in all session replays you create and view. Masking data prevents Amplitude from collecting it from your product in the first place. It does **not** remove the data from your own product data repository.

## Masking levels

There are three out-of-the-box privacy levels for Session Replay. You can also implement custom overrides when necessary.

- **Conservative**. This option is for companies that retain a large amount of sensitive customer data. Selecting this choice will mask **all text and all form fields**. This includes  HTML text, user input, and links. It will **not** mask text in pictures, videos, thumbnails, or other static assets. We recommend you [use CSS Selectors](https://https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.php) to exclude any pictures, videos, or thumbnails that contain sensitive information. Examples of companies that might choose this option are financial services firms, CRM systems, online betting companies, and companies in the healthcare industry—all sectors in which the inadvertent release of sensitive user data could have serious repercussions.

- **Light**. This option is for companies that retain very little sensitive customer data, and those who want to get up and running quickly and selectively choose any relevant fields to mask. Selecting this choice will only mask a **subset** of sensitive inputs: things like passwords, credit card numbers, telephone numbers, or email addresses. Examples of companies that might choose this option are business productivity app developers and ecommerce sites.

- **Medium**. This is the default option for Session Replay privacy settings. When it is selected, all form fields and text inputs will be masked; Amplitude will capture all other text as-is.

Any changes you make to these privacy levels will take precedence over privacy definitions set in the SDK.

## Set your privacy level

To set the Session Replay privacy level, navigate to _Settings > Organizational Settings > Session Replay Settings_ and select the appropriate project. Each project has its own settings. You can always see a summary of your masking level and overrides for each project on the main Session Replay Settings page.

### Override preset policy levels

You can override the out-of-the-box masking settings for individual elements by editing the elements’ matching [CSS selectors](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.php).

To do so, right-click on your application and select Inspect mode. Under *Masking Overrides*, enter the CSS selector you want to change and click *+ Add Selector*. This process can be used to mask, unmask, or exclude individual elements.

**Unmasking** an element also unmasks its child elements. If needed, you can remask these child elements using the process described above. However, when you **mask** an element using CSS selectors, its child elements will also be masked; you **cannot** then unmask these child elements.

When you **exclude** an element using CSS selectors, the element will be replaced with an empty placeholder element of the same dimensions. Any child elements will also be excluded.

## How Session Replay resolves conflicts between the SDK and the UI

When there are conflicts between the SDK and the Session Replay settings page around the handling of a particular element—whether it should be masked, unmasked, or excluded—the **Session Replay settings page will take precedence**.

For example, imagine you’ve used the Session Replay settings page to specify that `.selector1` should be masked, and `.selector2` should be unmasked. But an engineer has made a change to the SDK that states `.selector3` should be masked—and at the same time, they inadvertently specified that `.selector1` should be **un**masked.

Session Replay will combine the settings from the SDK and the UI, but in the case of `.selector1`, the settings specified in the UI take precedence:

|	| .selector1	| .selector2	| .selector3 |
|---|-----------|-----------|----------|
|Session Replay settings| MASK | UNMASK | |	
|SDK settings |	UNMASK | | MASK |
|End results | MASK | UNMASK | MASK |
