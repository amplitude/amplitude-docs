{{partial:collapse name="What happens if we go over the limit?"}}
We’ll give you the option to decrease your MTU volume the following month or start a 30 day trial of the Growth plan to decide whether you’d like to upgrade for more event volume. If you go over the event limit more than twice, Amplitude downgrades your account to the Free plan.
{{/partial:collapse}}


{{partial:collapse name="What happens after our one year Amplitude Startup Scholarship?"}}
At the end of one year, you’ll have the option to either upgrade to the Growth plan or go back to the Free plan. The Free plan includes 10 million monthly events and our core analytics features. We’ll provide you with an extra 30 days to trial the Growth plan while you make your decision. A Sales representative should be reaching out to you around the 11th month for any questions you may have. If you want to proactively learn more about your plan options, contact to the Sales team at [global-sdr@amplitude.com](mailto:global-sdr@amplitude.com). 

Amplitude can't grant extensions past one year for the Amplitude Startup Scholarship.

{{partial:collapse name="What if we want to go back to the Free plan?"}}
If you choose to go back to the Free plan, the system changes your plan type from Scholarship to Free once the extra 30 days are over. You aren't billed if you choose not to upgrade once the trial ends. You don't need to contact to Amplitude to downgrade your plan.
