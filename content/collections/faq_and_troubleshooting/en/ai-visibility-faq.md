## What is AI Visibility? 
AI Visibility is Amplitude’s solution for tracking and improving your brand’s presence in AI-generated answers across ChatGPT and Google AI Overview.

## Who should use AI Visibility?
Marketing, SEO, content, and product teams can all benefit—whether monitoring brand mentions, optimizing content for AI search, or proving ROI to leadership.

## How do I get started with AI Visibility?
AI Visibility is available directly inside the Amplitude platform and is available to all customers across all plans. Amplitude also provides a limited, free experience to non-customers here.

## How frequently is AI Visibility updated?
AI Visibility (logged-in) updates once each week.

The free version of AI Visibility does not update.

## Why does AI search matter for my business?
Consumers are increasingly using AI assistants instead of traditional search engines to research products. If your brand isn’t appearing as a recommendation in AI answers, you risk losing high-intent customers to competitors.

## How does AI Visibility measure brand performance in AI search?
AI Visibility provides a customer dashboard that includes your visibility score, competitive rankings, and the sources large language models use to generate responses. 

## Can AI Visibility show me where competitors are winning?
Yes. The competitive rankings feature highlights exactly which prompts and keywords lead to competitor mentions in AI search. It also provides recommendations about how to close the gap.

## What are the usage limits for AI Visibility?
* 500 prompts for free/Starter users
* 1000 prompts for Plus
* 2500 prompts for Growth
* 5000 prompts for Enterprise

## What platforms and models does AI Visibility track?
AI Visibility monitors brand performance in ChatGPT and Google AI Overview.

## Does AI Visibility connect to traffic and conversions?
Unlike standalone search analysis tools, AI Visibility is built into Amplitude. You can tie AI search visibility to products custom-built to manage customer behavior, conversion, and revenue.

## Are the prompts shown in AI Visibility based on data from real users?
No, OpenAPI, Google, and other companies don't share what users are searching. The prompts Amplitude generates are based on what LLMs know is relevant to your brand. 

## Is AI Visibility English only? 
No. In the logged-in version, you can configure a brand's prompts ande responses for any language. However, LLMs may occasionally still use English. 

## How does Amplitude’s AI Visibility compare to other AEO-specific tools like Profound and Evertune AI?
Amplitude’s AI Visibility stands out compared to other AEO tools because of two key differentiators: platform and pricing.

Since AI Visibility is part of the Amplitude Digital Analytics Platform, it connects with the rest of your org’s data to uniquely link AEO insights with ROI. It also uses the platform’s capabilities to prioritize recommendations and simulate changes, helping you take action on your insights faster. Other AEO-specific tools are siloed, and since many aren’t mature enough to have 3rd-party integration yet, you have to use manual effort to do anything with your AEO data.

Pricewise, other AEO tools run from moderately to extremely expensive. Amplitude AI Visibility is free.

## How does Amplitude’s AI Visibility compare to other SEO+AEO tools like Semrush or Ahrefs?
Compared to traditional SEO tools that have recently added AI visibility features, Amplitude’s AI Visibility stands out because of two differentiators: platform and pricing.

As part of the Amplitude Digital Analytics Platform, AI Visibility connects with the rest of your org’s data to uniquely link AEO insights with ROI. It also uses the platform’s capabilities to prioritize recommendations and simulate changes, helping you take action on your insights faster. Because other SEO suites are siloed, they require separate integrations or manual effort to do anything with your data.

And with other SEO suites, AI visibility comes at an extra cost—with Amplitude, it’s free.

## Can I modify the prompts? 
Yes, if you're logged into the Amplitude system. After you enter new prompts, the system refreshes. 

## Can I change the LLM that AI Visibility uses? 
No.

## Can I update my competitors?
Yes. In the main AI Visibility page, you can make the changes you want.

## Can I identify activity such as sessions and events from LLM or conversational AI tools?  
You can identify activity referred to an application from an LLM or conversational AI tool through either the referrer or the `utm_source`. There is logic for identifying each to the default channel rules. If you already have existing rules, you can replicate this logic within your own rules.

## Is prompt or citation level data available for referrals? 
LLM or conversational AI tools don't supply the prompts when users are referred to other applications. You can evaluate entry pages for sessions from LLMs to understand which pages on your site are most commonly receiving direct referrals.
