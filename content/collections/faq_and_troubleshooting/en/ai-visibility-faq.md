## What is AI Visibility? 
AI Visibility is Amplitude’s solution for tracking and improving your brand’s presence in AI-generated answers across ChatGPT and Google AI Overview.

## Who should use AI Visibility?
Marketing, SEO, content, and product teams can all benefit—whether monitoring brand mentions, optimizing content for AI search, or proving ROI to leadership.

## How do I get started with AI Visibility?
AI Visibility is available directly inside the Amplitude platform and is available to all customers across all plans. Amplitude also provides a limited, free experience to non-customers here.

## How frequently is AI Visibility updated?
AI Visibility refreshes weekly.

The free version of AI Visibility doesn't update.

## Why does AI search matter for my business?
Consumers are increasingly using AI assistants instead of traditional search engines to research products. If your brand isn’t appearing as a recommendation in AI answers, you risk losing high-intent customers to competitors.

## How does AI Visibility measure brand performance in AI search?
AI Visibility provides a customer dashboard that includes a visibility score, competitive rankings, and the source LLMs used to generate responses. 

Your visiblity score quantifies how often a brand appears in AI responses across major LLMs using hundreds of prompts.

## Can AI Visibility show me where competitors are winning?
Yes. The competitive rankings feature highlights exactly which prompts and keywords lead to competitor mentions in AI search. It also provides recommendations about how to close the gap.

## Does AI Visibility provide optimization suggestions for specific URLs or copy? 
Yes. AI Visibility surfaces automated recommendations to boos LLM visibility for specific pages and copy. These suggestions include adding clear headings, breaking long paragraphs into shorter sections, inserting concise FAQ blocks, and more. 

## Does AI Visibility connect to traffic and conversions?
Unlike standalone search analysis tools, AI Visibility is built into Amplitude. You can tie AI search visibility to products custom-built to manage customer behavior, conversion, and revenue.

## Are the prompts shown in AI Visibility based on data from real users?
No, OpenAPI, Google, and other companies don't share what users are searching. The prompts Amplitude generates are based on what LLMs know is relevant to your brand. 

## Is AI Visibility English only? 
No. In the logged-in version, you can configure a brand's prompts and responses for any language. However, LLMs may occasionally still use English. 

## How does Amplitude’s AI Visibility compare to other AEO-specific tools like Profound and Evertune AI?
Amplitude’s AI Visibility stands out compared to other AEO tools because of two key differentiators: platform and pricing.

Since AI Visibility is part of the Amplitude Digital Analytics Platform, it connects with the rest of your org’s data to uniquely link AEO insights with ROI. It also uses the platform’s capabilities to prioritize recommendations and simulate changes, helping you take action on your insights faster. Other AEO-specific tools are siloed, and since many aren’t mature enough to have 3rd-party integration yet, you have to use manual effort to do anything with your AEO data.

Pricewise, other AEO tools run from moderately to extremely expensive. Amplitude AI Visibility is free.

## How does Amplitude’s AI Visibility compare to other SEO+AEO tools like Semrush or Ahrefs?
Compared to traditional SEO tools that have recently added AI visibility features, Amplitude’s AI Visibility stands out because of two differentiators: platform and pricing.

As part of the Amplitude Digital Analytics Platform, AI Visibility connects with the rest of your org’s data to uniquely link AEO insights with ROI. It also uses the platform’s capabilities to prioritize recommendations and simulate changes, helping you take action on your insights faster. Because other SEO suites are siloed, they require separate integrations or manual effort to do anything with your data.

And with other SEO suites, AI visibility comes at an extra cost—with Amplitude, it’s free.

## Can I modify the prompts? 
Yes, if you're logged into the Amplitude system. After you enter new prompts, the system refreshes. 

## Can I change the LLM that AI Visibility uses? 
No.

## Can I update my competitors?
Yes. In the main AI Visibility page, you can make the changes you want.

## Is AI Visiblity analysis private? 
Yes. Any URLs you submit for analysis are processed within your authenticated Amplitude organization. When these requests are forwarded to the LLM endpoint, they are covered by contractual controls. By contract, your analysis requests are not retained or used to build public models.    

## What is Amplitude's default data retention policy?
Amplitude retains customer data for the duration of the subscription. After contract termination, Amplitude retains your information for a 30-day, data retrieval period. After that, all customer data is deleted unless limited retention is legally required.
