ai_summary: 'You can create custom events in Amplitude to analyze specific sequences of user actions. By grouping multiple events with an `OR` clause, you can track when users perform any of those actions. Custom events can be used in various analysis charts, but remember that they have limitations. Only certain roles can create custom events, and editing them may affect existing charts. To create a custom event, select the events you want to combine and set any necessary filters. Once created, you can use the custom event in different charts to analyze user behavior more effectively.'

Sometimes, you may need to create an analysis in which a particular step of the process can be any of a selection of specific events. For example, this analysis is interested in users who, after receiving a push notification, **either** played a song **or** searched for one as their next step:

By default, Amplitude does not permit you to select multiple steps directly through the Events Module. There is no `OR` clause for you to use here. However, it is possible to create a custom event that is made up of two separate events joined by an `OR` clause. You would then use this new, custom event in your flow.

In the image above, `Play or Search Song` is a custom event consisting of the `Play Song` event, the `Search Song` event, and an `OR` clause to connect the two. Any user who triggers **either** the `Play Song` event **or** the `Search Song` event is considered to have **converted** that second step.

Another method is conditioning an added event with an [event property or user property](/docs/data/user-properties-and-events). This is the primary method for analyzing if a user had performed one of many events.

## Before you begin

* Only admins, managers, and members can create custom events.
* Custom events are available only in the Event Segmentation, Funnel Analysis, Retention Analysis, Lifecycle, Stickiness, Impact Analysis, Pathfinder, and Compass charts.
* You cannot query on custom events in Redshift.
* All custom events will have the prefix '[Custom]' before the event name in your charts.
* Editing or renaming custom events being used on other charts will break those charts. Amplitude will continue to query the previously-named value until it is manually changed on any charts that use it. You will receive a warning when making any edits to custom events.
* Querying event properties on custom events will *only*be possible if the property is applicable to all events. If you're trying to create a custom event with five different events, and you'd like to see the location values from all of those events, you'll need to instrument the location event property to **all** the individual events making up the custom event.

## Group two existing events into a single custom event

To do this, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to *Data,* choose the project that you'd like to create the custom event for in the drop down. From *Events*, click *Create Custom Event*.

2. In the modal that appears, select the events you want to analyze as a single event. There is an option to set different filters on these events, in case the analysis requires a more granular view of the selected events.

At this point, this event is available for further analyses in Amplitude. To use it, select the newly-created event in the *Custom* category in the appropriate chart drop-down menus.
