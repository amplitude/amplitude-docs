## Considerations

- The specified date range refers to the time the event data was uploaded to Amplitude servers (see `server_upload_time`). The Export API returns events timestamped in UTC. Data is available to export at a minimum within 2 hours of when the servers received it. For example, data sent between 8 and 9 PM begins loading at 9 PM and is available via the Export API at 11 PM. Note that there is no delay in platform reporting. Only exports are delayed.
- Export API isn't supported for a cross-project view because the view doesnâ€™t own any data. To export all the data in the view, you would need to call the Export API on the underlying projects that actually ingested the data.
- Size limit is 4GB. If the size exceeds 4GB, the request returns a 400 response. In this case, choose a smaller time range to export the data. In cases where an hour's worth of data exceeds 4GB, use the [Amazon S3 export](/docs/data/destination-catalog/amazon-s3#run-a-manual-export).
- To export a whole day, use `T00` to `T23`. For example, `GET 'https://amplitude.com/api/2/export?start=20230101T00&end=20220101T23'`
- The max period you can query at once is 365 days.

## Response

The response is a zipped archive of JSON files. Depending on data volume, there can be several files per hour. The API returns a 404 response is there is no data for the time range you requested.

{{partial:admonition type="note" heading=""}}
Events before November 12, 2014 are grouped by day, instead of by the hour.
{{/partial:admonition}}
