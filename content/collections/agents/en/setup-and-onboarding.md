Amplitude Agents is available to all Amplitude plans. Specific features and functionality depend on the features available to your account, for example, Session Replay or Guides & Surveys.

Access agents in from the left navigation panel in Amplitude to find a set of preconfigured agent templates, like Dashboard Monitoring and Session Replay Analysis.

## Agent settings

To help agents start with the best context, project administrators can define which event in your taxonomy represents a page view, and which property in that event contains a page's full URL.
