Amplitude AI Agents are specialized, goal‑oriented AI experts embedded in Amplitude’s platform. Unlike generic copilots, agents have access to Amplitude analytics, session replay, experiment, surveys, and other data types to surface insights, investigate issues, generate hypotheses, then recommend actions.

For insight as to how AI uses your data and other compliance information go to [Trust in Amplitude AI](https://amplitude.com/trust#:~:text=Trust%20in%20Amplitude%20AI).

## How Agents work with Amplitude

Amplitude AI Agents bring together analytics, session replays, experimentation, guides, and survey data from across your account to build a deep understanding of user behavior. The more complete your Amplitude setup is, the more context and action recommendations the Agents have to work with.

The first Amplitude Agents are task-specific agents tuned to solve common problems like monitoring dashboards, bulk analyzing session replays, and optimizing conversion on websites. 

Select a dashboard or define a goal to get started. Examples of goals are improving trial-to-paid conversion or increasing feature adoption. After you set the context and instructions, the Agent analyzes your data for patterns, identifies issues, and recommends next step opportunities. It can also carry out actions you approve, like running an experiment or sending targeted guidance to specific user segments. 

Create and schedule multiple agents to identify and report key takeaways and improvement areas across your product then push insights and actions into places where work, like Slack, Amplitude, and email.

Interacting with Agents is simple. Use natural language to guide their work, set custom instructions and context to improve accuracy and relevance, then review insights and approve recommendations. Behind the scenes, Amplitude manages the orchestration, combining models from OpenAI, Claude (through AWS Bedrock), and Gemini with its own memory and tooling to ensure your Agents operate effectively.
