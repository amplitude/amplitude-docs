AI Visibility helps marketers and growth teams understand, measure, and amplify their brand presences in AI-generated answers. It surfaces visibility scores, competitor rankings, and recommendations for improvement. This lets you understand how your brand appears in AI searches and to act to improve your AI-driven traffic.

Most of the AI Visibility's insights are only available through a paid Amplitude subscription. However, some functionality for AI Visibility is free for everyone; customers and non-customers alike. 

Free functionality available to everyone is available on the Amplitude [Try AI Visibility](https://www.amplitude.com/try-ai-visibility) page of the website. 

In depth AI Visibility functionality for your specific brand is available by going to your Amplitude home page and then going to *Marketing Analytics > AI Visibility*.

The rest of this article describes the AI Visibility functionality available through the Amplitude tool. 

## Overview tab

The Overview tab contains high-level information about how your website is performing through AI-generated search. High level information includes:

* **Mentions this Week**: Percentage of AI responses that mention your brand.
* **Average Rank this Week**: Average position of your brand in AI-generated responses.
* **Citations this Week**: Number of responses mentioning your brand in the current week. 
* **Visibility/Rank over Time**: A graph describing your visibility or your rankings over time compared to your competitors. You can further refine this graph by specific topics.
* **Competitor Mentions**: A graph describing competitor mentions compared to mentions about your brand. By default, your competitors are limited to the top seven.
* **Top Topics by Visibility**: Displays the top topics relating to your brand that were returned by AI agents. Describes the number of mentions and responses used to calculate the percentage amount. 
* **Top Cited Sources**: Displays the top sources AI agents used to generate results. 
* **AI Chat Traffic**: Takes you to Amplitude's SEO Web Analytics page (if enabled.). Displays insights about your AI chat traffic such as overall totals, top pages, top countries, and sources.

## Prompts tab

The Prompts tab contains all of the prompts asked of the available AI agents that mentioned your brand or generated its results from your content. The page contains metrics as well as the ability to investigate individual prompts. 

You can filter individual AI models to investigate such as Claude, ChatGPT, or Gemini. You can also filter prompt results to include or exclude competitor brands or your own brand. Click either the **All Models** or **All Brands** drop-downs to filter AI models or competitor brands. If you want to exclude your own brand, select the **Exclude <BRAND>** checkbox. 

You can export all of these prompts to a CSV file for further analysis. Click **Export CSV** to download the exported file. 

### Metrics

The Prompts tab contains the following metrics:

* **Topics**: The total number of topics that have been generated relating to your brand.
* **Prompts**: The total number of prompts across all topics that relate to your brand or to your competitors.
* **Responses**: The total number of responses generated from the prompts that relate to your brand or to your competitors.

### Topics and prompts

By default, insights are arranged first by topic and then by the prompts that relate to that topic. For example, in the topic "Product Analytics", you might find the following prompts:

* "Compare leading product analytics services"
* "Ranking product analytics platforms 2025"
* "Best platforms for user behavior tracking"
* "How to analyze user retention in SaaS products"
