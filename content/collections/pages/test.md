## Background

Documentation at Amplitude is undergoing a big change. We're moving away from the concept of separate Help Center and Developer Center properties and different platforms, and aligning on a single platform to meet all our documentation needs.

We plan to deliver this project in Q224.

## Current state

### IA Test

The purpose of this test is to examine the navigability of the site using the top and left-side navigations. No effort was made to account for content in these pages. It may exist in some places, in others it may not.

Interaction design was not considered. Bare bones expand / collapse functionality was added. This will be redesigned during the design phase of this project.

### Article types

We're also codifying the types of articles and content this site will contain, and which metadata those article types will require or benefit from. For example, if we think of **SDK** as a content type, what default information can we provide for that content? We could include things, GitHub repository link, current version, migration guide links, and bundle size.

## Requests

1. Please explore the navigation structures on this site. After you explore the site, complete the five question <a href ="https://forms.gle/1RFN84jLZk76CMVP8" class="text-blue-800" target="_blank">survey</a> below about your experience.

2. If you have thoughts about article types, and included metadata, send them to Mark on Slack.
