landing_blurb: 'Assess the overall level of engagement of features in your product'
ai_summary: "With Amplitude's Engagement Matrix chart, you can analyze feature engagement patterns in your product. It helps you identify poorly performing features for improvement or removal and highlights successful features for expansion. This tool is available to users on Growth and Enterprise plans. To set up the Engagement Matrix chart, select events, define user segments, and customize metrics. The chart displays event breadth and frequency, allowing you to make data-driven decisions to enhance your product's performance. Explore the Engagement Matrix to optimize user engagement and product success."

With Amplitude's **Engagement Matrix** chart, you can develop a better understanding of the high-level pattern of feature engagement in your product, by breadth and frequency. By breaking out the top and bottom events for engagement into a four-quadrant matrix view, the Engagement Matrix will enable you to identify features that aren't performing well, so you can either refactor or deprecate them, and the features that are performing best, so you can find ways to extend that engagement to other areas of your product.

### Feature availability

This feature is available to users on **Growth** and **Enterprise plans** only. See our [pricing page](https://amplitude.com/pricing) for more details.

## Before you begin

First and foremost, events will not appear in any Amplitude charts until instrumentation is complete, so make sure you've got that done. You'll definitely want to read our article on [building charts in Amplitude](/docs/get-started/helpful-definitions).

## Set up an Engagement Matrix chart

The Engagement Matrix can be used to compare up to 100 events based on breadth and frequency of usage. Breadth is based on adoption metrics, such as % Monthly Active Users who have performed a particular event, while Frequency is based on the number of times or days an event has been performed.

### Build your chart

To build an Engagement Matrix, follow these steps:

1. In the Events Module, choose the **events** you'd like to include in your chart. You can select up to 20 individual event types; however, many Amplitude users find more exploratory value in using one of the default, out-of-the-box options:
	* **[Amplitude] Top Events:** Shows the top 50 **active** events (by event totals) in your project
	* **[Amplitude] Bottom Events:** Shows the lowest 50 **act**i**ve** events (by event totals) in your project
	* **[Amplitude] Top and Bottom Events:** Shows the combined top 50 and lowest 50 **active** events (by event totals) in your project, giving you a matrix view comparing frequent and infrequent feature usage
	
2. If you've selected your events individually, you can add properties to them by clicking *+ Filter by*, selecting the property name, and specifying the property value you’re interested in. You can also break out your results by property values, by clicking *+ Group-by* and selecting the properties and values you're interested in. These options are not available for any of the default Amplitude event groups.
3. In the Segment By Module, identify the user segment you want to include in this analysis. You can import a previously-saved segment by clicking *Saved* and selecting the one you want from the list. Otherwise, Amplitude begins from the assumption that your analysis will target all users.  
  
  {{partial:admonition type='note'}}
  You can only include one user segment in an Engagement Matrix.
  {{/partial:admonition}}
  
4. If you do not want to import a previously-saved user segment, you can start building your own by adding properties. To do so, click *+ Filter by*, choose the property you want to include, and specify the property value you’re interested in.

5. You can narrow your focus even further by telling Amplitude you only want to include users who have already performed certain actions. To do so, click *+ Performed*, then choose the event you’re interested in.  
  
  {{partial:admonition type='note'}}
   You can use [account-level reporting](/docs/analytics/account-level-reporting) with this chart type, which you can enable from the *...performed by* dropdown if you have instrumented groups.
  {{/partial:admonition}}

6. In the Measured As Module, set the metrics you'll use from the drop-down menus (described [below](#01H823GJ8AGWK069EYH4GJSVET)).
7. Finally, use the date picker in the chart area to set the timezone, interval, and timeframe of your analysis.

### Choose your metrics

![measured_as.gif](/docs/output/img/engagement-matrix/measured-as-gif.gif)

In the Measured As Module, you'll find a range of options to customize your Engagement Matrix analysis: 

* **% of active users and Average Times Performed per day:** First, decide whether you'd like to view your results by %DAU (percentage of your **daily** active users), %WAU (percentage of your **weekly** active users), or %MAU (percentage of your **monthly** active users).  
To change this option, you'll have to change your interval to match—for example, if your interval is set to "Monthly," you'll only be able to see your monthly active users.

{{partial:admonition type='note'}}
For some inactive events, you may see a %DAU / %WAU / %MAU value greater than 100%. This happens because the data point includes users who are only firing those inactive events, and may not necessarily be active in the time interval selected. 
{{/partial:admonition}}

Next, you can choose between *Average Days Performed* or *Average Times Performed:*

* *Average Days Performed* will display on the Y axis the average **number of days** an event was fired per unit of your interval (i.e., day, week, or month). Keep in mind that if your interval is set to "Daily," you may see events clustered at the very top of the Y-axis.

* *Average Times Performed* will display on the Y axis the average **number of times** an event was fired per interval unit. It is computed within the product as “number of times performed within a time unit of users *that performed at least one event* in the time unit”. So a value computed for each time unit then averaged for each time unit that had users - you can think of it as average of the averages.

* **Sectioned by:** This option determines how the quadrants of the Engagement Matrix are defined.

	If you select *Median*, the vertical line shows the **median** percentage of daily, weekly, or monthly active users (depending on your interval) that fired each event during the timeframe of your analysis. The horizontal line will show you the **median frequency** with which each event was fired, and it is calculated by taking the median of all the individual frequencies of each event.

	If you select *Average*, the vertical line shows the **average** percentage of daily, weekly, or monthly active users (depending on your interval) that fired each event during the timeframe of your analysis. The horizontal line will show you the **average frequency** with which each event was fired, and is calculated by taking the average of all the individual frequencies of each event.

  {{partial:admonition type='note'}}
  Both of these options will stay consistent when switching between a linear and a log scale.
  {{/partial:admonition}}

* **Log or Linear Scale:** Finally, you can specify if you would like to see the chart on a log or a linear scale, depending on which method better suits your Engagement Matrix analysis.
