## Work with Ampli

The Ampli CLI and Ampli Wrapper work together with Amplitude SDKs to generate a tracking library based on your Tracking Plan. The Ampli Wrapper is a dynamic, code-generated SDK. It has strong types for the events in your tracking plan, and provides autocomplete and static type checking. Learn more about [Ampli](/docs/sdks/ampli).
