## Setup

This guide is complementary to Luminal Analytics' instructions. For detailed technical specifications including complete lists of Events and Properties that Luminal captures and sends to Amplitude, visit the [Luminal Analytics documentation](https://luminalanalytics.com/documentation).

1. Copy your project's API key from Amplitude
2. Get your company key from Luminal (your account team can help with this).
3. Add the Amplitude & Luminal SDKs to your project:

	{{partial:tabs tabs="Package manager, Script tag"}}
	{{partial:tab name="Package manager"}}
	
	```js
	import * as amplitude from '@amplitude/analytics-browser';
	import { luminalPlugin } from '@luminal/amplitude-plugin';

	(() => {
		amplitude.init('YOUR_AMPLITUDE_PROJECT_KEY');	
		amplitude.add(
			luminalPlugin({
				apiKey: 'YOUR_LUMINAL_COMPANY_KEY',
				integrations: [],
			}),
		);
	})();
	```
	{{/partial:tab}}
	{{partial:tab name="Script tag"}}
	```html
	<script type='text/javascript' />  
		window.luminalOnLoad = () => {
			console.log('Initializing Luminal Analytics');
			amplitude.add(
			    Luminal.luminalPlugin({
			      apiKey: 'LUMINAL_COMPANY_KEY',
			      integrations: [
			        Luminal.googleAdsIntegration({
			          includeCustomTargeting: false,
			        })
			      ]
			    }),
			);
		};  
	</script>  
	<script type="text/javascript">YOUR AMPLITUDE SCRIPT TAG FROM THE AMPLITUDE UI</script>
	<script src="https://cdn.luminalanalytics.com/luminal.amplitude.plugin.js" />   
	```
	{{/partial:tab}}
	{{/partial:tabs}}
    
4. Using the Live Events view in Amplitude verify that the Luminal events (prefixed with `[Luminal]`) are making it into Amplitude.
5. Optionally, create custom dashboards in Amplitude to visualize the new engagement metrics you receive.
