[HubSpot](http://www.hubspot.com/) is an all-in-one marketing tool that helps attract new leads and convert them into paying customers, with features like landing page creation and email automation.

HubSpot's integration sends events generated by email campaigns from HubSpot to Amplitude.

## Considerations

- You need a HubSpot account and an Amplitude plan.
- This integration doesn't support sending event data into Amplitude's EU data center.
- This integration supports these identifiers:
    - User ID: Email address
    - Connection type: Server
- You can connect the same Amplitude project to multiple HubSpot accounts. You can confirm this by referring to the HubSpot Portal ID on the "Get Started Page" after you've connected via OAuth.
- The 10 events Amplitude fetches from HubSpot are those generated by HubSpot's Email API. You can't create and send  custom events with this integration.

## Setup

1. In Amplitude Data, click **Catalog** and select the **Sources** tab.
2. In the Other Sources section, click **HubSpot**.
3. Click **Connect to HubSpot** to authenticate via HubSpot.
4. Select all the relevant event types that you want to pull from HubSpot into Amplitude and click **Next**.
5. Click **Finish**.

## Sent events

This table shows you the events sent per channel.

See the [Email Events API Overview](https://legacydocs.hubspot.com/docs/methods/email/email_events_overview) from HubSpot for more details on the type of properties associated with each particular event.

List of user properties that Amplitude tracks:

- city
- region
- country
- `os_name`
- `os_version`

## Rename events

Using `data.amplitude.com`, you can change the display name and description for events, event properties, and user properties after the emails have been ingested into Amplitude.

## Unsubscribe from specific events

1. In Amplitude, navigate to the Sources page and click **HubSpot**.
2. Navigate to the **Edit Import Config tab**.
3. Select events that you wish to subscribe or unsubscribe to from HubSpot by checking the boxes.
4. Click **Update Import Configuration** to save changes.

## Confirm that Amplitude receives events

Amplitude makes requests to the HubSpot API on your behalf at a 1-hour interval to pull the latest HubSpot data in batches. You can verify this by going through the following steps:

1. In Amplitude, navigate to the Sources page and click **HubSpot**.
2. Navigate to the Ingestion Jobs tab to see the data history being imported from HubSpot.

## Example use case

Example Use Case: A marketing manager wants to analyze the performance of a sent email campaign.

Here are the following steps that you can take to analyze your email campaign:

1. Copy the Internal HubSpot ID from HubSpot. Each Internal HubSpot ID is unique and is associated with a particular email.
2. Next, go into Amplitude to create a funnel chart and filter by specific events to analyze the conversion rates. For example: `Email_Delivered` → `Email_Open`.
3. Based on the funnel, you can create a specific cohort for re-targeting purposes. For example,  users who opened the email.

Users can create a Funnel chart to see the conversion rate/email open rate or create a cohort to see how many people performed an "action" for a given email.
