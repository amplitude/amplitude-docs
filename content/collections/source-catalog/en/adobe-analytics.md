With Amplitude's Adobe Analytics integration, you can import your Adobe Analytics data directly into Amplitude, without any engineering work. Dive deeper into your Adobe-generated customer and product data, give your data governors more self-service control, and connect customer behavior across devices and channels. Your teams can go beyond single-device page view data and see a detailed, cross-platform view of all customer behavior.

This integration also gives your team better visibility into how raw data comes into your analytics system from various sources. This visibility comes in handy for not only planning and analyzing data, but also maintaining control, compliance, and privacy.

This article helps guide you through the process of ingesting Adobe data into Amplitude.

## Considerations

- This feature is available to customers on the [Enterprise, Growth, and Scholarship](https://amplitude.com/pricing) plans.
- Amplitude suggests reading this [blog post on how Adobe and Amplitude work together](https://amplitude.com/blog/adobe-customers-can-see-user-behavior-with-amplitude). You may also want to go over the [Data Taxonomy Playbook](https://help.amplitude.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000465251-Data-Taxonomy-Playbook) before getting started.
- Amplitude maps Adobe data like this: 
    - For `event_type,` Amplitude looks up the events in the Adobe event list and compares it to a lookup table where the event names are defined.
    - `user_id:` Amplitude uses `postvisidhigh` or, if that's not available, `postvisidlow`.
    - `device_id`: Amplitude uses `custvisid`.
    - User properties aren't synced in this integration. 
    - Amplitude receives data with the Adobe field names (for example, event1, event2, event3). For that reason, Amplitude recommends that you add display names for events.

## Set up and use the integration
