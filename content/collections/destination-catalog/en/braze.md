The Amplitude Activation Braze streaming integration enables you to forward your Amplitude events and users straight to [Braze](https://www.braze.com/) with just a few clicks.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

To configure streaming from Amplitude to Braze, you need the following information from Braze.

- **Braze API Endpoint**: The Braze endpoint for REST operations. Go to the [Braze documentation](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/basics/#endpoints) for help determining your endpoint.
- **Braze API Key**: The Braze API key used for authentication. Go to the [Braze documentation](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/basics/#rest-api-key) for help locating your API key.
- **Braze App ID**: The Braze App ID for the app receiving Amplitude events. Go to the [Braze documentation](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/identifier_types/#the-app-identifier-api-key) for help locating your app ID.

### Create a new sync

1. In Amplitude Data, click **Catalog** and select the **Destinations** tab.
2. In the Event Streaming section, click **Braze**.
3. Enter a sync name, then click **Create Sync**.

### Enter credentials

1. Select your **Braze API Endpoint**.
2. Enter your **Braze API Key**.
3. Enter your **Braze App ID**.
4. If you use the [Braze User Alias](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/objects_filters/user_alias_object) to identify your users on Braze, enter the **Braze User Alias Label** you plan to use. Otherwise, you can ignore this field.
5. Check the **Update Users Only**  option to update users that exist in Braze, not create new users. If you send alias-only user profiles, don't check this field. If you check **Update Users Only**, your alias-only user profiles aren't created in Braze. More information available in the [Braze documentation](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/objects_filters/user_attributes_object).

### Configure mappings

_This applies to both event and user forwarding._

1. Select an Amplitude user property that corresponds to your Braze user ID, from the left dropdown.
2. Select the type of your Braze user ID, from the right dropdown.
    - [**External ID**](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/basics/#user-ids): Any unique identifier for each user in Braze.
    - [**Braze ID**](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/basics/#user-ids): A unique identifier provided by Braze for each user.
    - [**User Alias**](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/objects_filters/user_alias_object): An alternative unique identifier for each user in Braze.
    - [**Email**](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/endpoints/user_data/post_user_track/#frequently-asked-questions): Using email as the identifier without an External ID or Braze ID may lead to unexpected behavior. For example, if Amplitude sends a user to Braze with an ID and the same email, Braze doesn't merge them, resulting in two separate users. For instructions to avoid this case, go to Brazeâ€™s [User Profiles](https://www.braze.com/docs/user_guide/engagement_tools/segments/user_profiles/) documentation. Braze also provides a [Merge User API](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/endpoints/user_data/post_users_merge/) for merging users, offering you more flexibility and control.

### Configure event forwarding

Under **Send Events**, make sure the toggle is enabled ("Events are sent to Braze") if you want to stream events to Braze. When enabled, events are automatically forwarded to Braze when they're ingested in Amplitude. Events aren't sent on a schedule or on-demand using this integration.

1. In **Select and filter events** choose which events you want to send. Choose only the events you need in Braze. Some transformed objects aren't supported. For more details, go to [Streaming Transformations Limitations](/docs/data/streaming-transformations#limitations).


{{partial:admonition type="warning" title="Events for anonymous users"}}
Braze requires that all events have an identifier present. If you selected any events to send to Braze that may not have an identifier, add a filter to send only events where the identifier is present. Otherwise, your delivery metrics may be affected.

1. (optional) In **Select additional properties**, select any more event and user properties you want to send to Braze. If you don't select any properties here, Amplitude doesn't send any. These properties are sent to Braze as [Braze custom event properties](https://www.braze.com/docs/user_guide/data_and_analytics/custom_data/custom_events/#custom-event-properties). Some transformed objects aren't supported. For more details, go to [Streaming Transformations Limitations](/docs/data/streaming-transformations#limitations).

### Configure user forwarding

To stream user and property updates to Braze, enable **Send Users**. This setting creates or updates users in Braze when you update them in Amplitude with the [HTTP V2 API](/docs/apis/analytics/http-v2) or [Identify API](/docs/apis/analytics/identify). This integration doesn't support scheduled or on-demand updates.

You can optionally select user properties to send to Braze in the **Select additional properties** field. Amplitude sends only the properties you select and only when one of them is updated. Amplitude sends these properties as [Braze custom attributes](https://www.braze.com/docs/user_guide/data_and_analytics/custom_data/custom_attributes/). Some transformed objects aren't supported. For more details, go to [Streaming Transformations Limitations](/docs/data/streaming-transformations#limitations).

### Enable sync

When satisfied with your configuration, at the top of the page toggle the Status to **Enabled** and click **Save**.
