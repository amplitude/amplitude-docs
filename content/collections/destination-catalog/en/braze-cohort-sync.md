Amplitude Data's Braze integration lets you send your Amplitude cohorts to Braze with just a few clicks.

## Considerations

- You must enable this integration in each Amplitude project you want to use it in.
- You need a paid Amplitude plan to enable this integration.
- For more details on using this integration in Braze, see the [Braze documentation](https://www.braze.com/docs/partners/data_and_infrastructure_agility/analytics/amplitude/amplitude_audiences/).
- You must have a Braze account. 
- Amplitude sends email alerts for job success and failures, keeping you informed about the status of your cohort syncs.

## Prerequisites

To configure a cohort integration from Amplitude to Braze, you need the following information from Braze:

1. Data Import Key
 
    - In Braze, click **Partner Integrations** then click on **Amplitude** and **Generate New Key**. 
    - See [Braze documentation](https://www.braze.com/docs/partners/data_and_infrastructure_agility/analytics/amplitude/amplitude_audiences/#step-1-get-the-braze-data-import-key) for more detail.

2. Endpoint: the endpoint for the REST operations 

     - In Braze, click on **Partner Integrations** and click **Amplitude**.
     - It looks like: `https://rest.iad-##.braze.com`. See the [Braze documentation](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/basics/#endpoints) to find your endpoint.

3. App Group REST API Key
   
     - In Braze, click **Settings**, click **API Keys** and then click **Create New API Key** OR choose an existing API key.
     - Find this in your Braze Developer Console. See the [Braze documentation](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/basics/#rest-api-key) for more detail.

## Amplitude setup 

1. In Amplitude Data, click **Catalog** and select the **Destinations** tab.
2. In the Cohort section, click **Braze**.
3. Enter your App Group REST API key, select your endpoint, and paste your Data Import Key.
4. Select an Amplitude user property and a Braze target object.
  * If you select **User alias** as the target object,  add a **User alias label**.
  * If you select a target object other than **User alias**, don't enter a **User alias label** .
6. When finished, save.

## Send a cohort

To sync your first cohort, follow these steps:

1. In Amplitude, open the cohort you want to sync, then click **Sync**.
2. Select Braze, then click **Next**.
3. Choose the account you want to sync to.
4. Choose the sync cadence. Select **One-Time Sync**, **Scheduled Sync**, or **Real-Time sync**. For more information about cohort syncing, see [Sync to third-party destinations](/docs/data/audiences/third-party-syncs).
5. When finished, save your work.

## Use the cohort in Braze

1. In Braze, to create a segment of these users, navigate to **Audience** and click on **Segments**.
2. Click on **Create Segment** and name your Segment.
3. Under Add Filter, select **Amplitude Cohorts** and choose the cohort you created and synced from Amplitude.
4. When saved, you can reference this segment during Canvas or campaign creation in the targeting users step.

## Email notifications

Amplitude automatically sends email alerts for cohort sync jobs:

- **Success notifications**: Receive confirmation when your cohort sync to Braze completes successfully
- **Failure notifications**: Get alerted when a sync job fails, allowing you to quickly address any issues

These notifications help you monitor the status of your cohort syncs without having to manually check the platform.

## Troubleshooting

### I don't see a list of users in Braze

When you sync a cohort, Braze matches users in that cohort with users that already exist in Braze, and doesn't create new users. Make sure users in your Amplitude cohort have a matching user (`userId`) in Braze.
