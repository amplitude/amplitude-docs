[Moloco](https://www.linkedin.com/company/moloco/) is a machine learning company that provides performance solutions for digital advertising. Their products include the Moloco Commerce Media (MCM) for online retailers and the Moloco Ads (DSP) for mobile advertising. Both products are powered by Moloco's machine-learning engine, which optimizes campaigns and provides personalized recommendations to customers.

This integration lets you stream events and event properties from Amplitude to [Moloco Commerce Media (MCM)](https://www.moloco.com/solutions/moloco-commerce-media).

## Considerations

Keep these things in mind when sending events to Moloco Commerce Media (MCM):

- You must enable this integration in each Amplitude project you want to use it in.
- The Amplitude integration is only compatible with Moloco Commerce Media (MCM).
- **Important**: You need a Moloco Commerce Media (MCM) account to enable this integration. If you don't have one, contact [Moloco](https://www.moloco.com/contact-us).
- Amplitude matches the **user ID** to the ID field within Moloco Commerce Media (MCM) to associated events. If a user with that ID doesn't exist within Moloco Commerce Media (MCM), Amplitude creates one. Make sure that the Amplitude `user_id` field matches the Moloco **Identity ID** to avoid user duplication.
- Amplitude sends all user properties along with the event.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

To configure an Event Streaming integration from Amplitude to Moloco Commerce Media (MCM), you need the following information from Moloco Commerce Media (MCM):

- **REST API Key:** To send data into Moloco Commerce Media (MCM), you need an API Key. Moloco uses this key to authenticate your requests to the API and connect the data with your account. Find this in your Moloco Commerce Media (MCM) account. 

### Amplitude setup

1. In Amplitude Data, click *Catalog* and select the *Destinations* tab.
2. In the Event Streaming section, click *Moloco*.
3. Enter a sync name using one of the following values. Then click *Create Sync*. Create a sync for each event type.
  - `ADD_TO_CART`
  - `ADD_TO_WISHLIST`
  - `HOME`
  - `ITEM_SEARCH_VIEW`
  - `LAND`
  - `PAGE_VIEW`
  - `PURHCASE`
  - `SEARCH`
4. Toggle Status from **Disabled** to **Enabled**.
5. Fill in the following fields
    1. **REST API Key**: This is the API key provided by moloco
    2. **Platform ID**: Identifier of the platform (for example, `Moloco Demo Test`)
    3. **Event Type** Type of the event this destination delivers. See the available options in step 3 above.
    4. **Platform Name**: Name of the platform. Should be all lower-cased and replace underscore `_` and empty spaces with a hyphen `-`
6. Toggle the **Send events**.
7. In **Select and filter events** choose which events you want to send. Choose only the events you need in Moloco. *Transformed events aren't supported.*
8. Under *Map properties to destination*, choose your user identifier and map specific Amplitude properties from Amplitude to Moloco.
9. When satisfied with your configuration, click *Save*.
