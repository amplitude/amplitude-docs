ai_summary: 'Amplitude Experiment uses deterministic randomization for assigning users to variants based on a bucketing key and salt. The process involves hashing the key and ID to determine if a user should be in the experiment and which variant they get. Users are first divided into 100 buckets for initial assignment, then assigned a variant based on another hash for variation assignment. Variants are associated with values between 0 and 42949672, depending on their weights. This method ensures fair and consistent variant assignment for experiments.'

Amplitude Experiment uses **deterministic randomization** of variations. This randomization uses the bucketing key selected in the UI, as well as the bucketing salt of the flag. In most cases, the Amplitude ID is used as the bucketing key.

This randomization model is two-dimensional: Amplitude Experiment performs a murmur3 hash of  `"bucketingSalt/amplitude_id"` , and uses that hash to determine first, whether a specific user should be assigned a variant, and second, which variant that user should be assigned.

For the first stage (the initial assignment), Experiment divides users into 100 buckets based on the value of  `mod(murmur3_x86_32("bucketingSalt/id", 100).`  If the bucket returned is **less** than the percentage rollout, then the user is bucketed into the experiment, in which case the user will be assigned a variant. If the user **isn't bucketed** into the experiment, they see the fallback variant instead.

For the second stage (variation assignment), Experiment will take all users bucketed into the experiment and assign each a variant according to the value of  `floor(murmur3_x86_32("bucketingSalt/id"), 100).` 

Variants are associated with values between 0 and 42949672, based on their **weights**. For example, in a two-variant experiment, if Variant A has weight 1 and Variant B has weight 1 (for example, each variant should receive 50 percent of the experimentâ€™s traffic), a user would be assigned to Variant A if the value of the hash lies between 0 and 21474835. The user would be assigned to Variant B if that value lies between 21474836 and 42949672.
