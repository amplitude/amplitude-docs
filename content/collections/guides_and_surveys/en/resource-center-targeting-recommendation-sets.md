Targeting in the Resource Center is exactly the same as targeting in the rest of Amplitude. For more information, go to [Cohort Targeting](/docs/guides-and-surveys/guides/setup-and-target)

Some things to keep in mind: 
- If you have specified targeting on your content source, that targeting takes precedence before the entry targeting. 
    - For example, if you designate source content as only applicable for people in the European Union (EU), that content won't appear in search results for users outside of that region. 
- If source content targets a specific segment but has also been added as part of a recommendation set with a different targeting, the targeting for the recommendation set takes precedence.

##### To target a specific recommendation set

1. For the resource entry you want, click **Setup**.
2. In the Targeting section, click **Targeted Users** and then specify your segments.
3. Under the Page targeting section, specify whether you want the entries to be available on any page or only on specific pages.
4. If you only want content to be available on specific pages, click **On specific pages** and then specify the specific pages you want.
5. Specify the priority level. By default, all entries are set to Medium priority level.
6. Click **Save**.
