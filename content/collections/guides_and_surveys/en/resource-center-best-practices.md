- The Autopilot feature uses a search algorithm that's based on semantic search to optimize relevance of the recommendation.
- Only one recommendation appears at a time.
    - The priority level assigned to a recommendation set decides which article appears first. 
    - If multiple recommendation sets have the same priority level, then the recommendation set that was most recently synced hass higher priority.
- There is functionality that lets you [source content from a public website](/docs/guides-and-surveys/resource-center-website-scraper). However, be aware that websites containing a lot of rich content or complex formatting may not reproduce exactly as expected. 
- If you want to remove an article from being visible to your users, set that article to **Draft** to unpublish it.
