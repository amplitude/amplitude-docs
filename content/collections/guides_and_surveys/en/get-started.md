Before you get started with Guides and Surveys, install one of the available SDKs, depending on where you want to display Guides and Surveys.

Click **Guides and Surveys** in the left navigation in Amplitude to get started.

## Overview

The Overview tab provides a high-level snapshot about how your Guides and Surveys perform. It provides key insights into engagement, interactions, and user behavior.

This tab provides a single location to track how well your in-product guidance performs. Is a new guide gaining traction? Are users completing your surveys? This tab provides a pulse check.

### Filter card

![](statamic://asset::help_center_conversions::guides-surveys/filter-overview.png)

The Filter card enables you to narrow the scope of your analysis to a specific date range, segment, or property condition. For example, look at a users on a specific account tier engaged, or find users who performed a specific action.

### Views and completions over time

View line charts for surveys viewed, surveys completed, guides viewed, and guides completed over the time range defined in the filter card.

Use [Microscope](/docs/analytics/microscope) on this chart to dive deeper with session replays, user streams, and session replays. Or target the users in that data point with follow up guides or surveys, create cohort, or download the users for export to another system.

### Total guide views

Provides the total number of non-unique views for guides over the last 30 days. Use this to help track engagement across all live guides.

### Recent guides performance

Displays a breakdown of individual guides and their view counts, over the last 30 days. Use this to compare how different guides perform at a glance.

### Total survey responses

### Recent survey performance
