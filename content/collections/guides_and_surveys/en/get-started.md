## Overview

The Overview tab provides a high-level snapshot about how your Guides and Surveys perform. It provides key insights into engagement, interactions, and user behavior.

This tab provides a single location to track how well your in-product guidance performs. Is a new guide gaining traction? Are users completing your surveys? This tab provides a pulse check.

### Filter card

### Views and completions over time

View line charts for surveys viewed, surveys completed, guides viewed, and guides completed over the time range defined in the filter card.

Use [Microscope](/docs/analytics/microscope) on this chart to dive deeper with session replays, user streams, and session replays. Or target the users in that data point with follow up guides or surveys, create cohort, or download the users for export to another system.
