The Personalize with variables feature (also called interpolation) lets you customize content within your guides and surveys by dynamically displaying user properties in a guide or survey. This can be useful to customize content for each individual user - like displaying their first name or user_id. You can add personalized variables to:

- Titles
- Content
- Button labels
- Button Action URLs

## Common examples

### Replacing parts of a URL
You can use user property variables in CTA links to personalize URLs. For example, you could create a link like:

```
www.example.com/path?user_id=@{{property.user_id}}&country=@{{property.country}}
```

When a user clicks on the CTA link, the user property variables are replaced with actual values:

```
www.example.com/path?user_id=12345&country=US
```

### Personalizing guides with a user's name
You could create a user property to display the user's first name such as `firstName`. You could then place this user property in any guide or survey where you want to address each of your users by name.

## Providing fallback values

Sometimes a user property isn't available for all users or all times. In that case, you can use fallback values as a safe default. For example, if you wanted to say "Hey there" instead of "Hey {firstName}" in case a user hasn't provided their name, you could use a fallback value like `{{property.firstName | there}}`.

## User property requirements

User properties must be shared client-side during the session with either the Amplitude SDK or the Engagement SDK. Properties shared from prior sessions or properties only stored on the server aren't yet supported.

To set user properties, use the [`_setUserProperties`](/docs/guides-and-surveys/sdk#set-user-properties) method in the Engagement SDK, or use `amplitude.identify()` in the Amplitude SDK.

Amplitude auto-populates `user_id` and `device_id` for you. These variables are always available without additional setup.
