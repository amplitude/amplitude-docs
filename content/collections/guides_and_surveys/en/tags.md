Tags help you organize and manage your guides and surveys by creating custom labels that make it easy to categorize, search, and coordinate your content across teams.

## The purpose of tags

Tags are custom labels you can add to your guides and surveys to help organize them. They're especially useful when you have many active guides and surveys running simultaneously across different teams or campaigns.

### Key benefits

- **Better organization**: Group related guides and surveys together
- **Improved searchability**: Quickly find specific content using tag filters
- **Team coordination**: Make it easier for teams to manage their guides and surveys
- **Bulk management**: Apply changes to multiple guides or surveys at once
- **Event tracking**: Tags are automatically included as a property on all guide and survey events

## Creating and managing tags

### Creating tags

You can create tags when creating or editing a guide or survey:
1. In the guide or survey editor, find the **Tags** section
2. Type your tag name in the text field
3. Press Enter or click the **Add** button
4. Your tag is now created and applied

### Tag naming best practices

- Use descriptive, consistent names (e.g., "onboarding", "feature-announcement", "user-feedback")
- Keep tags concise but meaningful
- Use lowercase with hyphens for multi-word tags
- Establish naming conventions across your team

### Renaming tags and editing description

To rename a tag or update its description:
1. Go to your guides list view or surveys list view
2. Click on the table settings icon, and make sure Tags is selected
3. Hover over a cell in the Tags column and click the edit icon
4. Click the edit icon and update the name and/or description
5. Save

The tag will be updated across all guides and surveys where it's used.

## Using tags to organize guides and surveys

### Applying tags to guides and surveys

**When creating new content or editing existing content:**
1. In the guide or survey creation detail page, click the **Add** tags button
2. Either select existing tags from the dropdown or create new ones
3. You can apply multiple tags to a single guide or survey

**When viewing your list of guides or surveys:**
1. Click on the table settings icon, and make sure Tags is selected
2. Hover over a cell in the Tags column and click the edit icon
2. Add or remove tags as needed

### Tag best practices for organization

Come up with a system of tags that makes sense for your team. For example you might run with the following:
- **Campaign tags**: Use tags like "spring-campaign", "product-launch" for time-bound initiatives
- **Feature tags**: Tag content related to specific features (e.g., "analytics", "billing", "onboarding")
- **Team tags**: Identify ownership with tags like "growth-team", "product-team"

## Searching and filtering by tags

3. Use the **Add Filter** dropdown at the top of the list
