  - 'Understand the basic concepts of the Resource Center'
---
Resource center is a widget that integrates directly into the [Guides and Surveys SDK](/docs/guides-and-surveys/sdk#content-security-policy-csp). It surfaces insightful and useful information to your users from anywhere on your site. The Resource Center widget appears as a clickable help icon. The center itself provides:
- Search functionality
- Recommended content
- Quick links
- Call to action button

Content for your Resource Center can be external or publicly available documentation repositories, articles, videos, or third-party chat modules.

Before your users can access the Resource Center to find relevant information, you must first set it up. Setting up the Resource Center includes the following activities:
- [Specifying the content][def] from which the Resource Center pulls information.
- [Creating the Resource Center links](/docs/guides-and-surveys/resource-center-recommendation-sets).
- [Setting up targeting and priority](/docs/guides-and-surveys/resource-center-targeting-recommendations) levels for users and pages.
- [Specifying the Resource Center settings](/docs/guides-and-surveys/resource-center-settings).
- [Reviewing Best Practices](/docs/guides-and-surveys/resource-center-best-practices) for the Resource Center.
