The source content you select should be either internal help (documentation) repositories or specific external content. Documentation repositories are typically more useful as they provide a large selection of information that's widely applicable to each page with which your users interact. 

- The Resource Center requires that you add documentation repositories and videos separately. 
- Each documentation source requires slightly different information to successfully add it to the Resource Center. Follow the onscreen prompts for required fields.
- If you don't see your specific documentation repository as an option, select the [Website](/docs/guides-and-surveys/resource-center-website-scraper) option to sync to a public website.
- You can also suggest Resource Center content integrations through a Survey that's sent to Amplitude.

##### Add documentation content to the Resource Center 

1. Go to **Guides and Surveys > Content**.
2. On the Sources tab, click **Add source**.
3. Select the source where your documentation resides.
4. Click **Next**.
5. For each source type, enter the required information in the Details section.
6. In the Sync options section, specify how often you want the Resource Center to sync to your data repository.
7. In the Default visibility field, decide if you want newly created articles set to Published (visible) or Draft (hidden). By default, this is set to Draft. 
8. Specify if you want to target this repository to specific users.
   - If you are targeting the content, you must specify the segments you want. For more information, go to [Setup and Targeting](/docs/guides_and_surveys/setup-and-target)
9. Click **Add source**.

##### Add video content to the Resource Center

1. Go to **Guides and Surveys > Content > Videos**.
2. Click **Add source**.
3. In the Status drop-down, specify the status of the video. Statuses can be one of:
    - Draft: Not visible to users.
    - Published: Visible to all applicable users.
4. Enter a title for your video in the Title field.
This title is what your users see in the link. 
5. Enter the video URL.
6. Click **Add video**.

After you have added your content sources, create your [Resource Center recommendation sets](/docs/guides-and-surveys/resource-center-recommendation-sets).

## Managing source content
As your organization grows and evolves, your source content also grows and changes. For this reason, keep the content that's available in the Resource Center up-to-date with your source repositories. Specify how frequently you want the Resource Center to automatically sync with your source content. Alternately, decide to manually trigger the sync as needed. 

Within the sync of your source content, you can manage some aspects of the content from the Resource Center:
- Remove specific articles from appearing in the Resource Center.
- Review new or updated content before it goes live to your users.
- Review any sync errors that may have occurred.
- Review the sync history to understand how recent your content is in the Resource Center.

##### To manage source content within the Resource Center

1. Go to **Guides and Surveys > Content**.
2. Click the source content you want.
3. In the new page, select individual articles.
4. Specify if you want to set them to **Draft** (unpublish) or re-sync them to the source.
