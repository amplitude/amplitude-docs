Amplitude provides you with both high level data in the form of aggregate use and engagement of your surveys, and response level information about individual responses and who left them. This analysis is available in the survey itself.

## Insights tab

A survey's Insights tab contains information to help you understand how your surveys are performing. It tracks responses, identifies trends, and filters data so you can make better decisions based on user feedback.

### Type-specific insights

Some survey types offer insights that are specific to the type of data they capture.

#### NPS

NPS survey questions enable a breakdown of promoters (score: 8 - 10), passives (score: 6,7), and detractors (score: 0 - 5). To calculate the NPS, subtract `% detractors` from `% promoters`.

#### List

See the breakdown of responses by option.

### Filter card

The Filter card enables you to narrow the scope of your analysis to a specific date range, segment, or property condition. For example, look at a users on a specific account tier engaged, or find look at users who performed a specific action.

### Views and completions over time

View line charts for surveys viewed and surveys completed over the time range defined in the filter card.

Use [Microscope](/docs/analytics/microscope) on this chart to dive deeper with session replays, user streams, and session replays. Or target the users in that data point with follow up guides or surveys, create cohort, or download the users for export to another system.

#### Time-based analysis

Track guide and survey engagement trends over predefined time periods.

* Hourly
* Daily
* Weekly
* Monthly
* Quarterly

With these presets, see when users are most likely to engage with the guide or survey and if engagement changes after, for example, a new product release.

#### Date range selection

Select a predefined range based on the unit of time, or click the calendar icon to define your own range. Choose from:

* Rolling window (`Last # complete days and today`)
* Since date
* Between dates

Use the advanced settings to:

* Add a date offset to a rolling window
* Exclude Today
* Enable Time Range

## Responses tab

If the Insights tab gives you the big-picture trends, the Responses tab is where you get into the who, what, and when of your survey data.

This is where you’ll read through individual responses to see exactly what users had to say. Instead of just numbers and summaries, you get raw, user-level data, tied to specific users and timestamps.

On the responses tab, you can:

* View individual responses: See exactly what each user submitted.
* Export responses: Export a CSV of survey responses.
* Sort & filter: Organize responses by date, user ID, or specific answers.
* Pin important columns: Keep key data points visible while scrolling.
* Adjust date ranges: Look at responses over the past 7, 30, 60, or 90 days.

If you’re trying to figure out why users feel a certain way, this tab gives you the nitty-gritty details to help make sense of their feedback.
