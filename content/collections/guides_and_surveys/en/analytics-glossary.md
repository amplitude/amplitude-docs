          Enables grouping of Guides and Surveys events by lifecycle.
          A guide's or surveyâ€™s "lifecycle" starts when it is triggered and ends when it is completed or dismissed. Lifecycle is independent of the application sessions.

          Lifecycle UUID is useful for analyzing events for a given guide/survey across multiple app sessions.
