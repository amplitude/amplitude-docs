landing_blurb: Understand the smart Autopilot features for Resource Center.
---
Autopilot for Resource Center recommendation sets automatically surfaces useful articles to your users as they interact with your site. It provides a smart fallback if no dedicated recommendation sets are available for any specific page. By using Autopilot, you don't have to manually create recommendation sets yourself. Autopilot pulls content from your repositories. This reduces the amount of setup and maintenance time for the Resource Center as a whole. 

Autopilot uses semantic search to power the recommendations it provides from each page. These smart recommendations analyze the page and then scan your content repositories for relevant or useful information. For example, if your users are on a sign-up page, Autopilot might surface a video that illustrates the sign up process. 

Autopilot is enabled by default from the [Resource Center Settings](/docs/guides-and-surveys/resource-center-settings) page.
