Guides are versatile, in-product messages that gently nudge your users toward completing specific tasks, exploring new features, or learning more about your product. Unlike traditional popups that can feel interruptive, guides focus on being helpful and timely. Guides use behavioral triggers, strike detection, and rate-limiting mechanisms to avoid annoying users.

## Guide templates

When you create a new guide, you can start with a blank guide, or use a template. Guides includes the following templates:

| Template     | Use case                                                                                               |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Tour         | Guide users to explore your product.                                                                   |
| Announcement | Tell your users something, like information about a product changes, company updates, or new features. |
| Checklists <br/> {.tag .web .zero} | Help your users complete tasks by showing them step-by-step instructions.        |
| Banners      | Highlight important messages or alerts.                                                                |
| Tooltips     | Provide quick tips or additional context, related to a specific element on screen.                     |
