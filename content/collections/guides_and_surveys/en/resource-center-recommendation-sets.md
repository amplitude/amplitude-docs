Recommendation sets are customizable, in-time articles and information embedded throughout your website to help your users as they need it. Think of them like personalized landing pages for your Resource Center. For example, you could create unique recommendation sets for:
- Advanced articles targeted towards your power users.
- Getting started articles for new users. 
- Custom marketing campaigns to highlight new features on specific pages.

You can create multiple recommendation sets for specific pages or you can create a single recommendation set for your entire site. It's up to you how detailed you want to be.

If you donâ€™t currently know how detailed you want your recommendation sets, use the Resource Center [Autopilot](/docs/guides-and-surveys/resource-center-autopilot) feature. This lets Amplitude decide which articles may be most relevant for users.
