Templates help you create reusable starting points for your team's guides and surveys. By providing pre-configured designs, placeholder content, targeting, and themes, templates ensure consistency while saving time for content creators.

## Key benefits

- **Consistency**: Ensure all team members follow the same design standards and messaging approach.
- **Time-saving**: Skip repetitive setup work by starting with pre-built foundations.
- **Standardization**: Maintain consistent branding, themes, and structure across all your guides and surveys.
- **Team efficiency**: Help team members get started with proven templates.
- **Quality control**: Review and polish templates before making them available to your team.

## Built-in Amplitude templates

Amplitude provides pre-built survey templates to help you quickly create common survey types. These templates appear in the Create Survey menu and include:

- **How did you hear about us**: A two-step acquisition channel survey that helps you understand where new users discover your product. The first step asks users to select from common sources (social media, search engines, referrals, advertisements, or other), and the second step collects additional details through an optional short-answer field.
- **NPS (Net Promoter Score)**: Measures how likely users are to recommend your product on a 0-10 scale. Use this to track customer loyalty by identifying promoters (9-10), passives (7-8), and detractors (0-6), then calculate your overall NPS score. Ideal for periodic health checks and benchmarking customer sentiment.
- **User Feedback**: A blank canvas for custom question sets. Use this when you need tailored questions for specific research goals, qualitative insights, or exploratory feedback that doesn't fit standard templates.
- **Rating**: Quick reaction surveys using stars, numbers, or emojis. Perfect for measuring satisfaction at key moments (post-purchase, after feature use, support interactions) without disrupting the user experience.
- **Banner Survey**: Non-intrusive surveys displayed as banners within your product. Use for broad reach without blocking the user flow, ideal for general announcements or low-priority feedback requests.
- **Tooltip Survey**: Contextual surveys attached to specific UI elements. Best for gathering feedback about particular features or flows right where users interact with them.

Built-in templates follow best practices, and you can customize them after creation to match your specific needs.

## Creating templates

##### Create a template from existing content

1. Open any existing guide or survey.
2. Click the three-dot menu near next to the Save button.
3. Click **Create a template** to copy the guide or survey as the base for your template.

Templates start out hidden from non-admins, giving you time to polish them before releasing them for your team to use.

### Template visibility and management

When editing a template, Amplitude displays a blue banner at the top of the page indicating you're editing a template rather than a guide or survey. This visual cue helps prevent confusion during the editing process.

## Building with templates

##### Using templates to create new content

1. Navigate to the Create Guide or Create Survey menu.
2. Your custom templates appear below the built-in Amplitude templates.
3. Select the template you want to use as your starting point.
4. Customize the content as needed for your specific use case.

Unhidden templates automatically appear in the same Create Guide/Survey menu that your team is already familiar with using.

### Template best practices and tips

- **Choose appropriate themes**: Select a theme before you make the template available to your team, as the template's designated theme also applies to new guides/surveys created from it.
- **Use clear naming**: When you create a new template, Amplitude automatically appends "Template" to the name. When team members create guides or surveys from templates, Amplitude automatically removes this suffix.
- **Polish before sharing**: Take advantage of the hidden state to test and refine your templates.
- **Consider your audience**: Design templates with your team's common use cases in mind.
- **Update Templates as needed**: Updating a template doesn't affect any guides or surveys that were previously created using that template.
