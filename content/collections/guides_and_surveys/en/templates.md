Templates help you create reusable starting points for your team's guides and surveys. By providing pre-configured designs, placeholder content, targeting, and themes, templates ensure consistency while saving time for content creators.

## Key benefits

- **Consistency**: Ensure all team members follow the same design standards and messaging approach.
- **Time-saving**: Skip repetitive setup work by starting with pre-built foundations.
- **Standardization**: Maintain consistent branding, themes, and structure across all your guides and surveys.
- **Team efficiency**: Help team members get started quickly with proven templates.
- **Quality control**: Review and polish templates before making them available to your team.

## Creating templates

##### Create a template from existing content

1. Open any existing guide or survey.
2. Click the dropdown menu near the title.
3. Choose **Create a template** to copy the guide or survey as the base for your template.

Templates start out hidden from non-admins, giving you time to polish them before releasing them for your team to use.

##### Template visibility and management

When editing a template, you'll see a blue banner at the top of the page indicating you're editing a template rather than a guide or survey. This visual cue helps prevent confusion during the editing process.

## Building with templates

##### Using templates to create new content

1. Navigate to the Create Guide or Create Survey menu.
2. Your custom templates will appear below the built-in Amplitude templates.
3. Select the template you want to use as your starting point.
4. Customize the content as needed for your specific use case.

Unhidden templates automatically appear in the same Create Guide/Survey menu that your team is already familiar with using.

### Template best practices and tips

- **Choose appropriate themes**: Select the desired theme before making your template available to your team, as the template's designated theme will also apply to new guides/surveys created from it.
- **Use clear naming**: When you create a new template, "Template" is automatically appended to the name. When team members create guides or surveys from templates, this suffix is automatically removed.
- **Polish before sharing**: Take advantage of the hidden state to thoroughly test and refine your templates.
- **Consider your audience**: Design templates with your team's common use cases in mind.
- **Update Templates as needed**: Updating a template will not affect any guides or surveys that were previously created using that template.
