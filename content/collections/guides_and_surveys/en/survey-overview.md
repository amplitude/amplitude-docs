Surveys are a source of user feedback. Like [guides](/docs/guides-and-surveys/guides), they feature a more targeted way to collect thoughts from your users, and increase the percentage of those thoughts that you capture.

## Survey templates

Surveys offer different templates than [guides](/docs/guides-and-surveys/guides/guide-overview#guide-templates). When you create a new survey, you can start with a blank guide, or use a template. Guides includes the following templates:

| Template      | Use case                                                                                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| NPS           | Capture customer satisfaction and loyalty by measuring the likelihood of that user recommending your product or feature. |
| User feedback | Define your own questions to collect detailed input from your users.                                                     |
| Rating        | Gather initial reactions to help you evaluate product experiences.                                                       |
| Carousel <br/> {.tag .mobile .zero} | Highlight your app's key features with a swipe-able onboarding carousel.                           |
| Banner Survey        | Provide any custom survey experience with the Banner form factor.                                                          |
| Tooltip Survey        | Provide any custom survey experiences with the Tooltip form factor.                                                         |
