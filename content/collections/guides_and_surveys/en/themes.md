Guides and Surveys should match your branding and feel like part of your product. Themes gives you control over your Guides and Survey's appearance.

Themes ensure that every in-product message matches your colors, typography, and aesthetic. Whether it's a subtle guide, or a full page survey, it should look and feel like an extension of your product, not a random popup.

From buttons to borders, animations to background colors, you're in control of how users view guides and surveys.
