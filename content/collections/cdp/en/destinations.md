Amplitude Data makes it easy for you to set up third-party platforms as data export destinations. This enables you to share data generated in Amplitude with other tools and stakeholders in a variety of contexts. 

## Feature availability
This feature is available to users on all Amplitude plans. See the [pricing page](https://amplitude.com/pricing) for more details.

## Add a destination

To add a new data destination, follow these steps:

1. From Amplitude Data, open the Destinations tab in the Connections section.
2. Click +Add Destination.
3. Look for the tile or search for the name of the destination you want to add; When you find it, click it.
4. At this point, you should see a modal asking you for information about your destination. The specific information required varies from destination to destination. Enter the information requested by the modal, then click Save.

## Destination notifications

3. Look for the *Notifications Button* with an email icon on the right side of your screen. When you hover over it, you should see *Manage Notifications*. Click the button.
