Amplitude Data makes it easy for you to set up third-party platforms as data export destinations. This enables you to share data generated in Amplitude with other tools and stakeholders in a variety of contexts. 

## Feature availability
This feature is available to users on all Amplitude plans. For more details, go to the [pricing page](https://amplitude.com/pricing).

## Add a destination

To add a new data destination, follow these steps:

1. From Amplitude Data, open the **Destinations** tab in the Connections section.
2. Click **Add Destination**.
3. Look for the tile or search for the name of the destination you want to add and click to select it.
4. Enter the information requested into the pop-up modal. The specific information required varies from destination to destination. 
5. Click **Save**.

## Destination notifications

Notifications alert you when you have an issue with your destination. By default, new destinations notify the creator and your Admins.

### Editing your notifications

1. Click **Destinations**.
2. Find the destination for which you want to configure notifications and then click to select it.
3. Hover over the **Notifications Button** with an email icon on it. Click the *Manage Notifications* button when it appears. 
4. From the Manage Notifications settings, you can **Subscribe** or **Unsubscribe** yourself. 
Additionally, you can also manage notifications to add or remove other email addresses.
