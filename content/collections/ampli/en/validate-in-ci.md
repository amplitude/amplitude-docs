ai_summary: 'Amplitude Data integrates with CI workflows, verifying analytics in each build. You create an API token, configure it as an environment variable, and run `ampli status` in CI. For JavaScript/TypeScript projects, install Ampli locally. Use Docker containers for Ampli CLI. GitHub Actions and Bitbucket Pipelines integrate easily with Ampli. Check Ampli implementation in CI using the provided YAML configurations. Use Ampli in any CI system supporting containers. You can now have Ampli running in your CI system.'

Amplitude Data works best when integrated into your continuous integration (CI) workflow, running continuously alongside your test suite. Amplitude Data integrates with all common CI providers, and you can configure it for custom environments.

After you've added Amplitude Data to your CI environment, Amplitude Data verifies your analytics against every build.

{{partial:admonition type="note" heading=""}}
Amplitude Data checks your analytics implementation against the tracking plan version that's currently checked in. If your team made changes to your tracking plan since the last call to `ampli pull`, those changes will not cause a failure in CI.
{{/partial:admonition}}

## Step 1: Create an API token

Create an API token for [your Amplitude Data account](https://data.amplitude.com/) by going to `Settings` => `API Tokens`. Ampli uses this token for authentication when running inside CI to update your tracking plan's implementation status.

{{partial:admonition type="warning" heading=""}}
Keep your token secret. Your token has global permissions on your account.
{{/partial:admonition}}

## Step 2: Configure a CI environment variable

Create an environment variable in your CI service called `AMPLI_TOKEN` and set it to the API token you created. Use this environment variable to pass the token to `ampli status` when it runs inside CI.

For example, this is what the [Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/environment-variables/) environment variables screen would look like.

Read the documentation for your CI service to get step-by-step instructions:

- [Bitbucket Pipelines](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/variables-in-pipelines-794502608.html)
- [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/)
- [GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/variables/)
- [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/tour/environment/#credentials-in-the-environment)
- [Travis CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/)

## Step 3: Prepare your project

By now, you've run `ampli pull` and `ampli status` in your project's root folder. The folder contains an `ampli.json` file with metadata about the current state of the Ampli Wrapper in your project. When you run `ampli status`, on your local machine or soon in CI, Ampli verifies your analytics against this file.

For non-JavaScript and non-TypeScript projects, this is all the configuration that's needed.

Optionally, for JavaScript and TypeScript projects, you may decide to install Ampli locally as a dev dependency. Installing Ampli locally in the project's `node_modules` folder simplifies installation and usage of Ampli for your team and CI environment. There are two steps to this.

### Install Ampli as a dev dependency

To install Ampli locally, run `npm install @amplitude/ampli -D`.

## Step 4: Run Ampli in CI

To integrate Ampli with your CI system, change your CI configuration to run [`ampli status`](/docs/sdks/ampli/ampli-cli#ampli-status) as part of the build process.

### Docker Containers

Amplitude has made it easy to run the Ampli CLI anywhere by creating [Docker Containers](https://hub.docker.com/u/amplitudeinc) which include all necessary dependencies.

#### amplitudeinc/ampli

The [ampli image](https://hub.docker.com/r/amplitudeinc/ampli) can be used to verify any Ampli SDK runtime except .NET.

#### amplitudeinc/ampli-all

The [ampli-all image](https://hub.docker.com/r/amplitudeinc/ampli-all) can be used to verify any Ampli SDK runtime, including .NET C#, but is larger in size.


{{partial:admonition type="note" heading=""}}
The `amplitudeinc/ampli-dotnet` and `amplitudeinc/ampli-swift` containers are deprecated.

Use latest version of `amplitudeinc/ampli-all` instead.

### GitHub Actions

The Ampli CLI Docker containers can be used in your GitHub Actions workflows by setting the `container.image` value.

Learn more about how to run GitHub Actions in containers in GitHub's documentation [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/running-jobs-in-a-container)

{{partial:tabs tabs="ampli, ampli-all"}}
{{partial:tab name="ampli"}}
```yaml
name: Ampli Implementation Check
on: pull_request

jobs:
build:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
container:
image: amplitudeinc/ampli

steps:
- name: Checkout repo
uses: actions/checkout@v3

- name: Verify analytics implementation and update status in Data
run: ampli status -t ${{secrets.AMPLI_TOKEN}} [--update]
```
{{/partial:tab}}
{{partial:tab name="ampli-all"}}
```yaml
name: Ampli Implementation Check
on: pull_request

jobs:
build:
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
container:
image: amplitudeinc/ampli-all

steps:
- name: Checkout repo
uses: actions/checkout@v3

- name: Verify analytics implementation and update status in Data
run: ampli status -t ${{secrets.AMPLI_TOKEN}} [--update]
```
{{/partial:tab}}
{{/partial:tabs}}

### Bitbucket Pipelines

The Ampli CLI Docker containers can be used in your `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` by setting the `image` value.

{{partial:tabs tabs="ampli, ampli-all"}}
{{partial:tab name="ampli"}}
```yaml
- step:
    name: Run 'ampli status' in CI
    image: amplitudeinc/ampli
        script:
        - ampli status [-u] -t $AMPLI_TOKEN
```
{{/partial:tab}}
{{partial:tab name="ampli-all"}}
```yaml
- step:
    name: Run 'ampli status' in CI
    image: amplitudeinc/ampli-all
        script:
        - ampli status [-u] -t $AMPLI_TOKEN
```
{{/partial:tab}}
{{/partial:tabs}}

### Other CI systems

The examples above are for GitHub and Bitbucket, but you can use the same images in any CI system that supports containers.

You should now have Ampli running inside your CI system. Congratulations!
